Great tour with Lisa,"It was a very pleasant experience to learn the history, architecture and politics of Florence from the knowledgeable and passionate guide. Lisa was delightful! She set up the pace to cover the subject and yet allowed our son of 6 years old to follow along. We couldn't have asked for better way to explore beautiful Florence.

Overcrowded gondola ride,"The gondola ride and gondolier were very nice, but I expected that 30-minute ride for $105 would be just for my family of three. Instead, we had 6 people in the gondola! I reviewed the description for this activity carefully
before I purchased , but nowhere I could see the information about 6 people in the gondola. TripAdvisor should do a better job of giving the full truth about the activity. If I did not book this ride on the TripAdvisor,'s site, I could have gone on the gondola of my choice, closer to where my hotel was, with my family only in the boat. This was one of only few experiences with TripAdvisor that did not meet my expectations.",August 2020,Classic 30-Minute Gondola Ride in Venice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187870-d11468187-Classic_30_Minute_Gondola_Ride_in_Venice-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",activities,3.0,3.5
Excellent way to see and learn about Venice.,"Even though several tour guides at the meeting place for the tour could not find my reservation, Caroline of Raphael Tours assured me that it will all be straightened out. In a few minutes our group followed her into the history journey. Caroline is a wonderful guide. She kept the group's attention, addressed the questions with lots of knowledge and kept us drawn to her commentaries throughout the tour.

Wonderful trip to Venetian islands,"It is a wonderful tour of three islands that are just a few minutes away from major Venice attractions. Glass factory in Murano eith the demonstration is excellent. I always knew about Murano glass, but seeing how the glass being sculpted was an eye opener.
Burano was impressive with its multicolored houses snd wonderful boutique shops.
Toricello island we found to be a piece of land that Venetians enjoy boating and eating well, including fine establishments.
The only thing I wished for was extra time on each island. We could not shop at the glass factory, we could not eat in the proper restaurant on Toricello island. Something to think about for those who organize the tour.",August 2020,"Murano, Burano and Torcello Half-Day Sightseeing Tour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187870-d11447520-Murano_Burano_and_Torcello_Half_Day_Sightseeing_Tour-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",activities,4.0,3.5
"Informative, pleasant discovery of fabulous hidden treasures of this charming island.",Georgia made this tour into a real cultural experience. She is a professional guide who is also a proud Greek who shares her knowledge with lots of passion. We would have never found the places we visited with her.

Incredible visit into our past,"I don't know, if I was more impressed with the view of Acropolis from the distance (I stayed in the hotel with stunning views of the Parthenon on Acropolis hill) or the close by walking along the most significant building/ruins of western civilization. Both are magnificent, so were the stories and history delivered with excitement by our guide Panagiana. We had 6-yrs old son with us, who got a kittle cranky under bright sun. Yet, the guide and the rest of our group jumped in to help us deal with our kittle devil. I have excellent memories of this informative and pleasant well organized tour.",July 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Life between the earth and sky,"It was an incredible journey. Even though we spent 8 hours+ in the train to get to and from Meteora, we have no regrets
More so, we had the experience of a life time. Seeing the unbelievable geological formations used by monks and nuns makes you feel that there is something spiritual going through your body.
Dimitrios was an excellent guide - very knowledgable and enthusiastic about the history, geology, politics and everything else he excitedly delivered for us. The entire tour was organized very well. We visited 3 out 6 monasteries in 4 hours and yet we had enough time to have lunch before tour and buy some food before leaving Meteora.
Highly recommend it!!!",July 2020,Athens Meteora Monasteries Day Trip by Rail,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12578109-Athens_Meteora_Monasteries_Day_Trip_by_Rail-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
Dive into old town full of beauty.,"This is the old part of town - narrow streets, boutique shops, exquisite restaurants, everything one could dream of while visiting ancient town. Also, we found great value for the money here.

Athens - you are beautiful!,"Arrival at Acropolis, the view of the ruins, the view of Aegean sea from the height of the fortified city. Our guide Panagiana (hope I spelled it correctly) was not only knowledgable, but enthusiastic about the history, architecture, symbolidm, exhibiting love and pride for her country.

"Hotel was excellent - rooms were cleaned on time, late checkout was honored.","Would like to see a pathway going around the property to enjoy the beautiful mountain views.
Far superior to Cherokee casino in Cherokee that makes you walk miles to the slot machines and service at front desk does not exist.

Majorelle gardens and camel ride,"The gardens are beautiful. They are adjacent to the house-museum of Yves Saint Laurent that was designed by famous French architect Jaques Majorelle. The intense blue color that Morelle used accentuates his work and makes it unique.
After a pleasant hour at the gardens we drove to palm grove where we took the most memorable ride on the camel. The guides know how to handle the camels. In comparison to a ride we took just a day before in Agafay desert, it was done extremely well. We had a head scarf tied in a way to protect our heads from sun and sand plus we were given the traditional robes to put on. It looked good and kept our clothes clean. My 5-year old son had a good time. At some point the guide took my son off the camel and allowed him to pull the ropes that pulled the camel. It was unforgettable! After 30 minutes of a ride we stopped at a local people's house for a mint tea and cookies. It was a nice gesture.",July 2019,Majorelle Garden and Palmeraie Camel Ride Marrakech,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g293734-d11475266-Majorelle_Garden_and_Palmeraie_Camel_Ride_Marrakech-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",activities,5.0,4.5
Fun at the South Beach,"This resort is so much more than a hotel with two double beds. It is more like a second home. The facility has everything you need for cooking, washing dishes and doing laundry. The staff cannot do enough for you. I have been coming back to this place for 5 years in a row.
