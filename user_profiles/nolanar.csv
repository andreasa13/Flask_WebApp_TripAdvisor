Interior looks good- redesigned for Sen.

Excellent food,"Luisa has opened a supper club three weeks ago. Luisa is passionate and lovely as a host.

It’s a lovely set up in the her dining area of her flat.

It’s loving home cooked food-
Make sure you are super hungry on arrival as there is a lot of food.

It’s bring your own wine.

The food was amazing- amouse bouche of three bites followed by scallops , octopus, sea bass, ray wings and pasta with crab and finish off with panna cotta and myrtho. We were extremely full at the penultimate dish.

Good sushi rolls,"Had food via Deliveroo.

Ordered rainbow roll and tempura batter flake roll were both excellent-
Both fresh and tasted like it would be in the restaurant.

Waited for 20mins and got a table.
The queue for a table was all night till we left at 10pm.

Reasonable Indian take away,"Ordered via phone and picked up. Time given was not accurate and had to wait -
Ordered 40mins before.

Ordered the keema nan and chicken madras- both average.

The chicken Madras sauce a very thick ( might have had too much thickener) and very unimaginative- chicken and madras sauce which lacked any veg- would have welcomed any veg including onions in dish.

Ok stay,"Not much of a choice as all other hot Sam shut due to lockdown and this was a work related.

Stayed for 5 nights from a Sunday night to Friday am.
Check in was easy.

Had a room on the 3rd floor facing the south facing promenade.

Room size is good basic. No closed wardrobe and little wardrobe space.
Also no bag table so bags on the floor.
Teas and coffee facilities in room but no iron and and fridge.

Toilets again reasonable size and basic.

Dining was closed so no hot breakfast. There is a vending machine at the entrance.

Most annoying thing about the stay is that one of the two lifts was out and stuck on the ground floor so you had to walk up one flight of stairs to use the lift.

There were number of occasions overnight where it was noisy, people pleasing at 530Am with door slamming or noise from other rooms late at night so noise insulation isn’t great.

Also to be aware, there was occasions where the hotel parking was full- mostly trade people staying over.",March 2021,Travelodge Rhyl Seafront,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616283-d15641376-Reviews-Travelodge_Rhyl_Seafront-Rhyl_Denbighshire_North_Wales_Wales.html,"Rhyl, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.5

Almost a perfect trip,"A world leading hotel. The entrance is lovely. Interior and exterior of hotel was very nice.

The check in was easy but check out took too long.

Had room 137- which was a standard room with a terrace however just off the main thoroughfare to the piano bar. The room location is better than rooms at the back which is quiet but was very dark as a lack of sun.Door handle have a hollow design and had dust collection in it.

Pool area is small and felt crowded. Noisy children playing made it less relaxing at times and also there were people at the pool who choose to have their mobile on ring and was not using ear phones when listening to messages etc. There was also a german speaking swimming instructor barking out commands to a young boy which was uncomfortable both in terms of noise and manner.

Pool restaurant for lunch was nice- lovely service from Bettina and Tamara and the food was great.

Gym was functional but again we had the German swimming teacher who doubled as a PT doing a class which took up the space for free weights.

Positives
Tea and coffee with cake on Monday and Friday at the piano bar

Live music at 2030

The BBQ buffet on Sunday but not on Wednesday( also in negatives)
Excellent spa area with salt water pool

Underground car parking

Close walking distance to the promenade
Rooms facing the pool

Negatives
Some rooms lack privacy such as 137, 138
Not adults only - kids played at the pool and was rather noisy.

Need to remind house keeling to Resupply water, coffee capsules and body cream consistently- there was a day without coffee capsules - had to call front desk to inform.

Interior dining music is terrible in the restaurant and spoilt the mood/ ambience

Dinner at 8pm- twice too many people turned up and there was a 20minutes wait- first time sat in doors , second time- went for a drink and came back

Firstly the music is far too loud for dinner and asked the waiter to see if it could be lowered but no avail. So subsequent could not hear what others were saying across the table.

Also found dish too salty. The sauce of the pork was too salty. The dish was other wise good. The padron pepper was good and so was the croquets. The scallops was ok.

A Perfect stay....Almost,"Great location as 100 meters from where road ends to pedestrianised street.
Location is pretty amazing both for the Main Street and also for thr access to the main road.

There is no designated parking although when checked on tripadvisor mentions parking. Parked on the street which was ok as not busy this year.

Down three flight of stairs to the Canava suite which is part of the honeymoon category- interior is similar to a long white cave, cool interior with two seating area, dining area with kitchenette and also bed room as one space.

Interior was rather simplistic that took some time to grow on us. Some issues with water pipes overnight but otherwise relatively quite.

Mel and Antonio were attentive and helpful during the stay.Check in and out was easy and quick.

The highlight of our stay was the view, which was absolutely stunning and what Oia is famous for and the ease to get to shops and restaurants around Oia.

There are three honey moon suites which are off Different interior and terrace sizes. Dimitri’s has the largest terrace and next to the Atrina villa.Mina is large terrace but the partition wall cover the late evening sun. Canavas suites smallest terrace and has main stairs going down adjacent to the to the pool.Xenonas is on the seperate stair way which makes it much more private. Tony’s is next to the main staircase
and so is Thalos and the studio and therefore privacy in all was rather limited.

Cavavas suite Terrace had an amazing view- the Instagram view that is famous with an Olive tree that helped keep sun out if not too keen on tanning.there is also a parasol on the terrace.The sun shone the whole day with great views of sun rise and sunset. However if there were two persons wanting to tan- that could be an issue due to the limited space and the olive tree.

Breakfast as surprisingly basic- make your own tea and coffee , pastries from a bakery in plastic packages , yogurt, water and orange juice from a carton. We felt that this was similar to food on a plane.We went to Passarin bakery which is 30meters away which had excellent Baklava , coffee and orange juice. There is also Passagio at the start of the around the corner for proper coffee and orange juice- more effort could be made on this.

Shared the Grilled eggplant which was outstanding- it looked like a vege burger- layers of aubergine, cheese and tomatoes with an amazing sauce of basil , mastelo and sour cream.

The dorado and veal were both amazing- the fish was cooked perfectly and the skin was crispy.
The veal had a star anise hint with Pearl barley sweat grilled carrots.

The Syrah glass of the red was excellent for the veal.

For desert the creme brûlée which was more of a Greek tiramisu- it had multiple players including coffee! Outstanding and not to be missed for coffee lovers.

We had lunch with was a rather limited menu and struggled to find something we liked.

Interior was dark and a they have a lovely outdoor terrace.

The food was average to say the least- blend and uninteresting!

The Santorini plate was a disappointing dish of hard generally inedible bread which is the barley rusk with tomato paste and caper leaves on it with servings with sides olives, tasteless fava beans and sundries tomatoes.

Cycladic spring rolls was good and had a mixture feta cheese, sundried tomato, yogurt sauce- best for the three dishes.

The fava beans scrimp risotto also called Scrimp Favarotto was another average, tasteless dish with a rather poor show of 5 scrimps.

Average at best,"Not sure what the hype is but we had dinner and found the aubergine salad was similar to pickled aubergine with oil out of a pickle jar with some cheese and toasted bread.

Had bread with some dips before the starters.

Had the watermelon salad which was very interesting.

Got the 900g steak which is similar to a t-bone: was good but not outstanding-parts inside were rare : if not into very red will suggest more than medium-rare.

The entrance was opposite the acropolis museum and I believe there is another entrance on the exit too.

It cost 20 euros for just the acropolis or 30 if you like to visit the other 6 sites offered in a 5 day period.

We downloaded the free audio from Rick Steves which is about an hour long. The first 20 minutes is a hot hike up to the theatre of Dionysus and then to the Propylaea.

Then through the Propylaea you will see the pantheon in front.

We were there at about 1030am and there we some shady spots. The status of the maidens in Erechtheum was beautiful.

Ordered the tuna tartar and the calamari ouzo- the tuna tartar was good, calamari was average.

Had the sea bass and Naxos steak for mains- the sea bass was overdone. The Naxos steak was meant to be medium rare and came rare and cold so sent it back and when it came back it was overdone and wasn’t rested enough so had a gameness to it.

House wines by the glass is good.

"Great location , noisy in the mornings","Location good, heart of plaka, great eating places around the corner like NOLAN.

We stayed in room 831 which is a deluxe room with Acropolis views and terrace which was small but functional.

It has a nice view of the Acropolis but the city panorama is obscured partly by terrace in front

Room rather cramped at the entrance- the terrace lacks privacy both from neighbours as well as terrace across the way which is partly blocking the view. Atleast there is a view of the acropolis as per the room description. Noisy fridge which had to be unplugged and dangerous wardrobe handle which was impractical as well as sharp. Bed were at expected standards. Bathroom was nice with walk in shower which is large. Tea and coffee facilities was provided but only one tea bag for two so had to get more.

Noise from 6 am with street, bells ringing, furniture moving in the floor above were all a nuisance!

The pool is small with 12 sun beds and 4 pool beds. It has sun all day depending on which area. Rush to get the sun areas by 2.30pm but there is inadequate sun beds for number of guest.

Gym was functional- had to call to the spa to book a time slot- had two running machines, a cross trainer , a bench with weights from 2-20kg and a abs bench.

Breakfast was average- had to QR code book yourself in- but doesn’t really work so just went up anyway. it was buffet style but was served- fruits were unripe, the scrambled egg average, pastries were soggy. There is the option or ordering an omelette which they don’t tell you. Coffee was average. Orange juice is excellent as fresh, sit outside for the views. The pigeons during breakfast are a nuisance.

All in all a mixed stay for us.

Amazing tasting menu,"Had the 4 course tasting menu and paired wine - was sat out in a lovely courtyard with nice romantic lighting and beautiful ambience.

We had a Greek rose sparking which was nice.

The 3 amouse bouche was good, followed by bread on the oil plate with tomatoes drops.

The starter of Dakos was light and fresh.
The crab was excellent.The lamb was rather gamey.Desert of Fig was excellent.

Modern and minimalist interior and exterior with outdoor seating.

Had the zucchini with miso and smoked aubergine, the soba with salmon and tahini, the cod burger and the friend chicken.

Great introduction to Athens,"We had the Monday 945am tour with Jonathan- he was informative and entertaining. There was a group of over 20.

Started with the arch of Hadrian to the Olympics stadium , the park, the change of guards, presidential palace.

We then went to the academia, the market and a few other interesting areas.

Excellent meal,"Pick this place after seeing the food of TA.

Interior is modern and you can view the kitchen via a glass window when you go to the toilet The food lives up to the pictures.

Firstly, there are two menus- the bar menu with starters and the mains as a loose paper form and desert and wines in a leather bound menu.

Ordered the duck cones in cauliflower, ahi tuna and the scrimp pops -all excellent.

Then had the brisk which melted in your mouth with the fries called everyone’s favourite- both amazing.

Cocktails was amazing too - had the Makers mark, illusion, talk to strangers: all great.

For desert- have the cobbler of the season which is for two and needs 40mins. It taste like Christmas cake with caramel ice cream.

The grilled vegetables was very good.

The Mediterranean spaghetti was average as a bit blend. The moussaka was ok- too much cheese and potatoes.

1.you can buy your tickets online and it valid for 2 hour slots.

2.There are a number of free tours( once you have bought your admission tickets) - Sunday at 1100 and Tuesday morning - look at the website for future information.

3.Don’t forget to go below the building for the archeological excavations.

The exterior and interior is stunning.
The ground floor is for minor gods , the first floor of the pre Parthenon and statues.
Best part is the videos about the restoration, the various artefacts.

The top floor has the various Parthenon displays as well as the frease. There is a good video about the built of the Parthenon.

Good sea bass but....,"Firstly, the tables for two are too small- had a number of accidents over the meal due to the lack of space. Sat inside next to the window which was very cramped.

Starters-dolomades was average and the Saganaki was good but a bit too much cheese it.

The grilled octopus was good but the tentacles was over done - needs a diffident cooking time to the rest of the main body.

Sea bass was excellent but came out about 20 mins after the grilled octopus which if you are having dinner with someone else puts a damper on the meal. The accompanied with quinoa salad good, mass with fish eggs was good.

Service was good and they were apologetic about the sea bass and knocked the wine off.

House wine was average-good value.

Disappointing lunch menu,"Had lunch here at the beginning of September- was sunny outside but the interior was depressing and dark with low vaulted ceilings.

The lunch menu looked like a good deal but the starter of cockles on toast bread was average. It is odd to try to pair sea bass with a tomato based sauce but decided to try it which was awful- didn’t suit, the fish was fishy with anchovies so was extra pungent of fish! One to avoid - ideally needs a change of dish sauce.

The desert of half a peach roasted with some crispy bits was average and could be down at home.

Accompanied wine was basic- Sauv Blanc, Merlot or French rose.

Service was good.",September 2020,The Potted Pig,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186460-d2191126-Reviews-The_Potted_Pig-Cardiff_South_Wales_Wales.html,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Fantastic food and presentation,"Had dinner here a few weeks ago and opted for the 6 course tasting menu.

Pleasantly surprised by both the quality of the dishes and presentation.

The amouse bouche was outstanding with 5 dishes- all excellent. Particularly enjoyed the bread sticks,bread with various butters.

The seafood starters were both good.

Found the scallops rather fishy but overall was ok.

The wagyu beef Main was excellent and cooked to perfect as also the presentation.

The deserts was good- particular enjoyed the Cuban themed desert.

Had the two course lunch- Spinach agnolotti and the terrine. Both good but the agnolotti sauce and mushrooms was too salt.

Mains of fish and chips
And pork belly, both cooked well but the fish was over salted and so was the chips. The condiments of potatoes, mash and cheese broccoli was all good.

Just incredible,"Second visit- first time in March just before lockdown for dinner, this time for lunch. Interior is absolutely stunning and would suggest a walk around as the interior of the downstairs parlour and other areas are stunning.

It’s a Theater for food. Service is excellent with a French accent!

The starters came as 7 dishes of various seafood such as sea urchin, pigeon pate, crab in open crispy pastry, a jelly, artichokes and a medley of seafood main starter dish, we were full after that.

Mains - amazingly cooked fish - spot on with accompaniment of Pak Choi and squid. desert was light as was already stuffed!

Just Terrible !,"Post covid , had the usual temp a check on arrival.

Was informed that rooms would not be cleaned every morning as pre covid but only after check out.

Stayed on the 2nd floor in 228.

Hallway smelt of a combination of cigs and dusty carpet. Rooms equally smelt bad- in aired and a smell of cleaning products!

Room Interior looked aged with significant scuffs on the bed base, walls and side tablets- see photos! A real lack of detail from those managing to look and monitor the quality of rooms!

Side table glass was not secure and would move hence had cause previous damage to wall!

Defects ceiling in corridor, in wall papering, tatty curtains side, mould of shower frame.

Dirt from cleaning and cleaning items left on stairway.

Therefore too hot and stuff that we decided to end the meal after the mains.
Had the three course with bubbly . Over priced wine list with mark up of X4!

Food was mixed- Foie grae and saddle of lamb was good, the fish main was overdone. Was too hot to finish the meal and decided not to have desert yet they brought out a small desert.

Sat in the extension serviced by probably the worse Waitering service- chopsticks thrown on the table, wrong order, when asked for a recommendation- informed by the waiter that does not like fish.

When wanted to order again- was given the hand to wait rather than a simple vocalisation of give me a second or moment.

It’s such a shame because the food is excellent but unfortunately the experience is based on the Waitering too which is where the experience is completely ruined!

It’s family run hotel by a Swiss German couple and their son. Clients are generally from the Swiss- german nations. Menus are in a number of languages including English.

Go for the half board as the evening meals off 5courses is amazing- almost Michelin standard- only set back is getting into you clothes after the holiday.There is also an amazing selection of wine- try the Chardonnay from Majorca from the vineyard In Manacor.

Our favourite room is 205 with a massive terrace overlooking the salt fields.

Breakfast post covid is mostly table service with a variety of items from fruits, meat and cheese platter also with cooked toastier of avocado, tomato and beef or scrambled eggs. There is the added selection of eggs, cooked Spanish items like Tumbet with Spanish sausages or creamed spinach and bacon. The crepe was average.

Things to do near by- the beach is a 5
Mins walk away but we generally walk the 45 mins to Es Trenc- check out the other entry.

Highlight of the day has to be dinner with the amazing 5 course meal- start with salad, then the most amazing selection of soups from veloute/ consomme, a entree plate of sashimi, scallops and even had rabbit.
Mains portions are adjusted for the number of dishes so on the smaller side- the fish selection was amazing. Desert could do with a bit more imagination- the tiramisu is excellent and there is always a desert dish of the day.

It has a lot of sea weeds on the first day but they must clean the beaches in the morning as the subsequent days the beach had been returned to its natural beauty.

Clear white sands with turquoise waters and very flat sea beds with the very occasional rock. It’s the kind of scene from somewhere in the carribean.

There’s two big dinning rooms at the top floor, the first is much more styling than the second which has more or of an eastern feel.

We went for the ala carta as each course comes with 5 different dishes which sounded more exciting that the tasting menu. The langoustine starter was amazing and so was the seafood mains. I had the grand desert which was also excellent.

Terribly sad but amazing museum,"The museum really bring the air of sadness when you go around. There is extensive information about the building. The attack of the twin towers and the other places of attack with videos, voice recordings and multitude of artifacts.

Download the museum app which allows you have a guided tour.

One of the best and saddest museums I have been to.

I think 3hours and more to see all.",February 2020,The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d1687489-Reviews-The_National_9_11_Memorial_Museum-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good Foie Gras,"Tried the main restaurant and was busy so managed to get a table for lunch on Sunday via opentable.

It’s a much smaller place- degree of French rusticness.

There was a lunch menu but opted for the Foie Gras- was good.

Has a Cote de rhone red.

Service was good.",February 2020,Petite Boucherie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d10145683-Reviews-Petite_Boucherie-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Not all dishes are that good,"Extremely busy on sat night at 1845- long queue even for those reserved to be seated.

Was seated upstairs- cocktail for bar was ok- lychee sake with coconut water.

Ordered the steam dumpling- that was good. The roast pork rib starters was dry and didn’t have much taste other then crunchy fat.

Ordered the pork chop which was a large portion but the pork was sadly dry and ate a little and left the rest. The marinade was a little odd too.

Extremely busy environment.",February 2020,Obao,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d5937621-Reviews-Obao-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Over priced,"It’s has a lovely interior and great views of the vessel.

Starters of sea urchin and oysters was good but not outstanding.
The crab cake once again was average with a nice sauce.

The beef Wellington was extremely disappointing as it tasted like an average dish. The meat wasn’t great tasting either with too much pastry around and wasn’t crispy or flakey.

Cocktails was good again above the standard price.

Good food,"Based in the Vendue Hotel.
Arrived for dinner rather late at 9.45 pm and was pretty empty.

Had the beetroot salad with cheese and nuts which was good but was really something I could make at home.

The Scrimp and grit was excellent and well presented.
