Unbelievable vista,"Its definitely quite a climb but there are shady places and seats and benches under trees.good to sit at various points along the way and see Athens laid out before you.
As for the comment about not many signs- the main path is paved with stones all the way up so shouldn't be a major problem.which ever path you take you are going up.
Amazing to note that Athens must be one of the few European capitals not spoilt by tall buildings and skyscrapers.once at the top it is indeed worth the climb.",October 2019,Philopappos Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d523835-Reviews-Philopappos_Hill-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Very good value,"From the moment I made the reservation direct the confirmation was instant.
Check in was friendly,professional and helpful.
The single room was clean,fresh white sheets on the bed.the shared bathroom was again clean and the hot water magnificent.
The continental breakfast is amazing for a hostel.fruit juice,cereal,fresh fruit,salad,cereal,bread,butter,jam.definitely s breakfast above and beyond what one finds in a hostel.
Think its important people realise what they are paying in today's ridiculous prices.
This is indeed a hostel worth coming to.",October 2019,Hotel Fivos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d511094-Reviews-Hotel_Fivos-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,2.5
Great shabbat outing,"Come on shabbat when the shops,restaurants and cafes are open.Christmas is a must time to come as the local christian community decorate the area.Definitely a great time to spend a few hours and spend a little money on the great local cuisine.",October 2019,Wadi Nisnas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293982-d325458-Reviews-Wadi_Nisnas-Haifa_Haifa_District.html,"Haifa, Israel",attractions,4.0,4.0
Over too soon,For the 25 shekels one way and 35 for a return its quite a pricey five minute ride and when you get to the top you could have paid 6 shekels for a bus ride and got the same views but I suppose for a one time thing its probably OK.,October 2019,Aerial Cable Car,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293982-d320533-Reviews-Aerial_Cable_Car-Haifa_Haifa_District.html,"Haifa, Israel",attractions,3.0,3.5
Easy way up the mountain,I love this little ride and its a cool attraction for kids.for those staying downtown its handy for the trip up to the Carmel centre.,October 2019,Carmelit Subway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293982-d8779732-Reviews-Carmelit_Subway-Haifa_Haifa_District.html,"Haifa, Israel",attractions,4.0,4.0
Changes all around,"Most of the original buildings now either hotels,guesthouses and restaurants and this is fine but new apartment blocks are being built which take from the original feel of the colony.Just as they did to the German colony in Jerusalem.
The restaurants are attractive but prices are ridiculous.",October 2019,The German Colony,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293982-d325455-Reviews-The_German_Colony-Haifa_Haifa_District.html,"Haifa, Israel",attractions,3.0,4.5
Beautiful shrine and gardens,"Beaware.If you enter from Ben gurion,bottom terraces you can only visit bottom terraces,equally if you enter from yefe hot at the top,then you visit the top only.
And if you enter in the middle you may visit the shrine and the middle gardens.
There is a guided your from yefe hot but usually crowded.
All in all beautiful gardens and spectacular at night for the view but that's about it.",October 2019,The Baha'i Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293982-d319539-Reviews-The_Baha_i_Gardens-Haifa_Haifa_District.html,"Haifa, Israel",attractions,3.0,4.5
Overpriced eatery,"For a small salmon steak,a salad,a glass of wine and an adequate creme brulee plus tip was 260 shekels,a ridiculous price for an average meal and poor service.
The restaurants in the German colony are all attractive but the prices are not.
It is basically a tourist trap as most evenings there are crowds but like most Israeli restaurants price does not always guarantee quality and service.",October 2019,Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293982-d3639050-Reviews-Garden-Haifa_Haifa_District.html,"Haifa, Israel",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Good guest house,"This guest house is now managed by a lovely group of welcoming nuns.Great value ,clean and pleasant room with ensuite in a beautiful 120 year old house with a lovely garden where you can sit and relax.the breakfast is more than adequate.please understand this is a guest house originally for pilgrims but is a stones throw from the German colony and bahai gardens and Aldo near the train station for easy access to the north and south.regular buses run from Ben gurion avenue connecting all Haifa.you may a third of what normal hotels in the area cost and is really worth considering.",October 2019,St. Charles German Hospice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293982-d320530-Reviews-St_Charles_German_Hospice-Haifa_Haifa_District.html,"Haifa, Israel",hotels,5.0,4.0
