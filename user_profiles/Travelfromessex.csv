Sit down coffee!,Mid-morning and Warren Street was fairly quiet so we were pleased to be able to get a free table outside. We very much enjoyed sitting out with our lovely coffees and an oh so tasty fitzroy bun. A definite find just down from busy Tottenham Court Road.,April 2021,Honey & Co.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d3224508-Reviews-Honey_Co-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Lovely food and setting,"We had excellent cheese and onion toasties plus coffee at this place in the attractive Bocking gardens, just outside Braintree Town centre.

Everything was so fresh and tasty and made for a nice lunch in the park. Definitely recommended.",April 2021,Coffee House in the Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503772-d8805838-Reviews-Coffee_House_in_the_Gardens-Braintree_Essex_England.html,"Braintree, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great trip out,"As we inch out of lockdown, a nice outing was had to this National Trust owned site. Parking by the Mill Hall, it's a short walk up the stepped path - steep in parts but manageable - just be careful if it's muddy.

It was so quiet on Easter Sunday with just one or two people about. A nice view from the top and we enjoyed sitting on the bench by the pond having a picnic. Don't forget to check out the windmill nearby, from the outside at least, until lockdown lifts. Coffee from the nearby High Street rounded off a very pleasant day out.",April 2021,Rayleigh Mount,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g858504-d4355162-Reviews-Rayleigh_Mount-Rayleigh_Essex_England.html,"Rayleigh, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Good takeaway coffee,"Good to see they were still open for takeaway, even on the first day of the tier 4 restrictions.

We very much enjoyed our coffee and hot chocolate. Plenty of space to wait for your drinks whilst keeping social distancing. Definitely recommended overall.",December 2020,The Larder Wanstead,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2441101-Reviews-The_Larder_Wanstead-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Excellent lunch,"We only had to wait a few minutes to get a table, even on a busy post-lockdown Saturday lunchtime. We very much enjoyed our poached eggs with toast, halloumi and patatas bravas plus a halloumi wrap. The eggs could have been a little warmer but it really didn't make much difference.

We also very much enjoyed a cappuccino and latte and it was no problem for us to request a mulled wine to take away.

Overall very highly recommended in the very pleasant Leigh town centre. We'll definitely try and come back.",December 2020,The Brunch Co.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1138967-d13867328-Reviews-The_Brunch_Co-Leigh_on_Sea_Southend_on_Sea_Essex_England.html,"Leigh-on Sea, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Stunning church,"Simply walk along the main Christchurch High Street to the far end and you'll come to the Priory.

A terrific place to walk around with parts dating back as far as the Norman era.

Great - went twice!,"We called in for some lovely coffees and, having failed to find anywhere that looked a better bet, returned for a late lunch.

We both found the Welsh rarebit so tasty as we sat in the window looking out on lovely Christchurch High Street. A toasted tea cake was also very nice.

All in all a highlight of our day in Christchurch.",October 2020,Coast Coffee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190800-d3388578-Reviews-Coast_Coffee-Christchurch_Dorset_England.html,"Christchurch, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent dinner,"We actually saw this place mentioned in passing as a better option in a review of another place in Bournemouth. We sat upstairs and very much enjoyed the paintings and other decor throughout the restaurant. I should mention there's a lift available.

We very much enjoyed our halloumi burger and mac and cheese with a ciabatta. Also one of their cocktail variations was very pleasant.

This was our first visit to a Cosy Club and we'd definitely recommend it if you're in the Bournemouth area.",October 2020,Cosy Club Bournemouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186262-d8802724-Reviews-Cosy_Club_Bournemouth-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great spot in Bournemouth,"Stayed here for 3 nights at this well located place almost opposite the Pavilion Theatre. The sea front and tourist information centre is only 5 minutes walk away and the town centre the same in the opposite direction. Only the station would probably need a bus or taxi to get to.

We stayed in a premier plus room which was great overall - spacious with a coffee machine, ironing board etc. For some reason these don't have a balcony or sea view which was a bit disappointing.

We had breakfast each morning at the hotel which was fine though it's best to book this in advance given the social distancing.

All in all a very good base for our break in Bournemouth.",October 2020,Premier Inn Bournemouth Central Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186262-d1133897-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Bournemouth_Central_Hotel-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Unheralded gem,"Excellent visit here to this house on the cliff top next to the Royal Bath hotel. As with many attractions these days it's best to book your timeslot/ticket on line beforehand.

There's an interesting 10 minute film on the first floor about the couple who owned both the house and hotel.

On the next floor up (a lift is available) is a lovely cafe which is well worth a stop prior to going into the main house. A guide to the rooms can be downloaded onto your phone and each is packed with art works and objects of interest.

Plenty of volunteers on hand to ask questions of as well. Also tremendous sea views from some of the rooms.

A nice souvenir shop rounded off an excellent visit.",October 2020,Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186262-d286490-Reviews-Russell_Cotes_Art_Gallery_Museum-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very good pizza,"Wanting somewhere nearby for supper on our first night in Bournemouth, we happened upon this very nice place. We were seated without having made a reservation and very much enjoyed the salad, margherita pizza and potato wedges that we had.

Everything was promptly brought up by the friendly staff. All in all, a very good start to our Bournemouth break.",October 2020,The Bournemouth Stable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186262-d10743883-Reviews-The_Bournemouth_Stable-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Ok but could be better,"The hotel did a job for us overall as we were in the area for an overnight stay. Paid parking is available at the hotel and there was no problem finding a space.

We had an accessible room on the first floor of the annexe building. The shower had been left in far too high a position to be accessible but otherwise the room was fine and of a good size.

We booked for breakfast but were still told on arrival at the restaurant that there would be a 15-20 minute wait before they took our main order. Whilst we appreciate the problems caused by the pandemic, this seemed odd and why take reservations at all if that's the case?

The food was fine when it came.

Overall ok but we've had better experiences in other premier inns.",August 2020,Premier Inn London Edgware hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1646063-d287840-Reviews-Premier_Inn_London_Edgware_hotel-Edgware_Greater_London_England.html,"Edgware, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
Ok but could be better,"We sat outside in Wanstead's pleasant High Street. Our frappe and latte took a little while to come. Latte was find but the frappe mocha tasted a bit powdery.

Excellent coffee,"Popped in here mid-morning and had no problem waiting whilst the polite lady behind the counter caught up with her orders.

I took a seat inside as it was still fairly hot out and received an excellent latte within no more than 5-10 minutes.

Attitude?,"I wandered in and ordered a coffee and was told in a rather surly way to take a seat. A pity as it has a nice conservatory part at the back and could be nice.

Excellent lunch,"A rare opportunity to go out for lunch midweek and this proved an excellent choice. We had booked but, due to covid/recession/people working from home, had the place virtually to ourselves.

We very much enjoyed the small plates of bread, olives, patatas bravas and cheese balls. Great coffee also.

Service was very good and attentive. Hopefully they will get busier again as time goes on.

Coffee stop in Shoreditch,"We all very much enjoyed this place which is near the Old Street roundabout. It was quiet on a Sunday afternoon so we had no trouble finding a table outside.

Coffee break,"We stopped off here to break our journey to Maldon. Only a small car park but the pub was quiet at the time so that wasn't a problem on a Saturday afternoon.

The pub was open for sit down customers, despite the sign outside giving a slightly different impression?

In any case, we enjoyed the decor and atmosphere of the pub very much as well as our coffee and soft drinks.

Great coffees,"We enjoyed a very nice coffee stop at this heritage building just off Colchester's busy High Street.

They have put in plenty of Covid protocols so you can sit in the pretty courtyard or inside. We enjoyed lovely coffees and they were only too happy to box up a couple of scones for us to take with.

Very good visit,"The museum had been massively modernised since I visited around 20 years ago and had just reopened following lockdown. Only very small areas were unavailable and they will take groups down to see the prison cells which are themselves definitely worth seeing.

The museum is fascinating and details the whole history of the town. The I-pads you are given free of charge took a bit of getting used to in terms of where to use them but we enjoyed being able to view a clip of a bbc history programme where they were examining Roman jewellery that is in fact on display just in front of you.

We booked in advance (by phone) although it looked like you could just walk up and enter when we were there.

A definite must do if you're in Colchester.",July 2020,Colchester Castle Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190735-d519595-Reviews-Colchester_Castle_Museum-Colchester_Essex_England.html,"Colchester, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Good choice for a break,"Our first post lockdown hotel stay and this proved a very good choice. The hotel enjoys a good location in a quiet residential street very close to the entrance to Castle Park and is no more than a 10 minute walk from the High Street.

Our room was very clean - important in these difficult times of course. All printed material had been removed bar a useful sheet explaining the cleaning and hygiene processes at the hotel.

Breakfast was available at the Thyme restaurant but the buffet is no longer unfortunately. The good news though is that everything is cooked fresh to order now. On our second morning at least, they left the orders in the middle of the restaurant and beckoned you over to collect it yourself. Presumably the idea was to further reduce close contact between staff and customers and we soon got used to it.

There a fair size car park at the hotel and you pay on reception.

We were delighted the hotel was back open and very much enjoyed our stay.",July 2020,Premier Inn Colchester Town Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190735-d8679172-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Colchester_Town_Centre-Colchester_Essex_England.html,"Colchester, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Excellent meals,"We each enjoyed a good meal here sitting outside on a Sunday evening. Our steak, sea bass and borek options were each thoroughly enjoyed. Nice tiramisu for dessert too.

Knockout historical site but could be presented better,"Oh dear, wanted to give it more and it of course remains a must see in Athens but there are some really quite simple things that could be done to improve the experience. Firstly, the route up from the stop of the hop on hop off bus is not signed at all and isn't easy to find without having to double back on yourself. We also thought it ironic that the disabled elevator seems itself to be poorly signed and up a considerable climb (unless we missed something).

There are around a dozen separate parts to the site and it would seem tailor made for an audioguide. There isn't one though and you have to make do with the static signs (in english and greek). A good suggestion on here was to download an 'unofficial' one beforehand but there really should be their own one, as seen after all at the Panathenaic stadium for example. As it was, we were pleased we'd taken some guidebook pages with to assist in interpreting things.

Even still, it's a tremendous place, particularly the Parthenon and the Temple of Dionysus.",December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Changing of the guard,Staying very close by we were able to watch both the hourly changing of the guard and the full ceremony that takes place on a Sunday morning. Definitely worth a look if you're visiting this delightful city.,December 2019,Hellenic Parliament,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198707-Reviews-Hellenic_Parliament-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Nice lunch,"Nice lunch here for a group of five of us. A variety of high quality, tasty dishes were enjoyed including garlic and herb bread, eggs royale and fish finger sandwich. Nice drinks and coffee too.

Service could have been a little quicker at times but this wasn't a major issue.",December 2019,Bill's Brighton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d939459-Reviews-Bill_s_Brighton-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html,"Brighton, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
A bit mixed but not all their fault,"It was a bit unfortunate really that when we took the bus the weather was poor and we had to sit downstairs. The bus could be redsigned to remove the branding from the window areas as it made it difficult to see through the windows on what was a very wet day. It also wasn't the company's fault that some demonstrations in the city meant some of the stops had to be bypassed and the cordoned off roads meant the traffic became very heavy.

Another suggestion would be for them to point out in some way the route from stop 7 to the entrance to the Acropolis as this really isn't very clear.

Despite the above we still enjoyed the tour and it made for an interesting start to our Athens break.",December 2019,City Sightseeing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2021235-Reviews-City_Sightseeing-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0
Excellent all round choice,"This turned out to be a very good choice for our Athens break. The hotel is maybe 100 metres from Syntagma Square and the Parliament building with many other attractions within walking distance. The metro stop is also just along the road and bus stops are opposite.

We had an extremely spacious room with a very large bed. Excellent bathroom too and a lovely balcony with views of the Parliament and national gardens. As another review has stated, it seems only the heating in the room works at this time of year rather than the air con though it wasn't a major problem.

We enjoyed the huge selction at breakfast each morning - one of the best we've seen anywhere and also had a nice casual dinner in the cafe-bar in the lobby. There's also a lovely roof terrace on the top floor with great views across to the Acropolis.

Like Athens generally, we were sorry when our stay came to an end. Very highly recommended all round.",December 2019,Amalia Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d233049-Reviews-Amalia_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great collection,"We didn't originally plan to come here but were very glad we did. Huge collection of pottery and other ancient Greek finds plus many statues.

A better map/guide rather than the small photocopy you're given might help. Interesting shop in the basement and check out the pleasant coutyard by the cafe.

All in all recommended.",December 2019,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Excellent food,"A very nice anniversary meal here at this local place in the parade opposite Harold Wood station.

We ordered the sea bass which was so fresh and tasty as well as a number of sides. The feta borek was particularly good as were the dips and warm beds.

No compaints really. A coffee machine would be welcome though our apple and mint teas were also enjoyed.",November 2019,Izmir Meze,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14168999-d17700842-Reviews-Izmir_Meze-Havering_Greater_London_England.html,"Havering, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good portions of nice food,"Three of us came mid-afternoon and enjoyed a very nice late Sunday lunch. Very tasty food includind sea bass, onion rings, artisan breads, veggie burger and nut roast. We also enjoyed sharing the desert platter.

Downsides - not many really. Couldn't understand why they couldn't do a chai latte when it's shown on the menu and we probably hit the end of the Sunday lunch peak which meant it was very crowded in the car park. We managed to squeeze in somewhere but it wasn't easy. Don't forget to enter your reg no. on one of the consoles as you go into the main building.

All in all a very enjoyable meal and we'd look to go back.",November 2019,The Nags Head,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503773-d730153-Reviews-The_Nags_Head-Brentwood_Borough_of_Brentwood_Essex_England.html,"Brentwood, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
No complaints,Attractive modern looking place on the London platform of Bath Spa railway station.

Late lunch,"Three of us met here for a late Sunday lunch. It was busy but we were seated quickly. We very much enjoyed our food including a flat bread, chips and spicy rice bowl all of which was delivered pretty quickly considering the crowds.

A bit noisy of course but we enjoyed the new menu and will probably return.",October 2019,Giraffe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d5243153-Reviews-Giraffe-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Good coffee,There's a lot of competition in the Berwick Street area but I enjoyed a very nice latte here mid-morning. It was fairly quiet and I easily got a seat. Good quality coffee quickly served.

Good coffee,Popped into this new place in Edgware High Road after learning that Sophie's Kitchen has sadly closed. We had both hot and cold coffees which were very nice. The decor and 'living ceiling' aren't to everyone's taste but we felt worked overall. Seems like a good addition to the area's restaurants. Service was quick and attentive.

Good meal overall,"We enjoyed as a large family group a birthday celebration meal in the rear part of the restaurant.

We had the pre-booked fixed menu but there were still choices for everyone. The accompanying hot bread and dips were excellent. Service was attentive throughout.

Just to add that it's not restaurant's fault but parking in the vicinity is very limited.

Busy,"Four of us came in for coffee and pastries which were all very nice. The place seems extremely popular and was pretty much packed on a Sunday lunchtime.

Unfortunately the music being played was far too loud and didn't encourage us to stay any longer.

Finally, it's not the restaurant's fault but parking in the area is very limited. We parked in the station car park but you will need to register by phone if you've not done so previously.",September 2019,Middeys Brasserie & Lounge Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1480935-d6542107-Reviews-Middeys_Brasserie_Lounge_Bar-Barnet_Greater_London_England.html,"Barnet, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Very good lunch,"We enjoyed a very nice lunch at this modern place in East Mersea that I had noticed on the Visit Mersea website. There is a nice outdoor terrace and field but, as it was a hot day, we opted to stay inside. No problem getting a table and our food was promptly brought up.

Everything was so freshly made and we very much enjoyed our goats cheese salad and spinach and halluomi open sandwich. The huge and piping hot triple cooked chips were a bonus as well.

We looked round the shop which has lots of locally made foods and arts & crafts and even went back to the restaurant for coffee and ice cream.

All in all, a real highlight of our day trip to Mersea Island.",August 2019,Mersea Barns Shop & Café Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g13917436-d17389883-Reviews-Mersea_Barns_Shop_Cafe_Restaurant-East_Mersea_Mersea_Island_Colchester_Essex_E.html,"Mersea Island, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Ok fish and chips,"Just off Oxford Street we got seated quickly on an early Saturday evening. There was nothing wrong with our fish and chips as such and the homemade tartare sauce was a bonus. It's just that we've had tastier fish and chips overall at some other places. I should say the food was served up to us very quickly.

Just to add that only one toliet for a place this size isn't really enough.",August 2019,Golden Union Fish Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1539452-Reviews-Golden_Union_Fish_Bar-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Excellent and fascinating,"I thoroughly enjoyed my trip here. A lengthy and fascinating guided tour follows a short film of Ramsgate during wartime and there's also a museum area to look round. It is a bit chilly though on the hottest day of the year, even this was welcome!

Very good meal,"We had a most enjoyable meal at this fairly large place on the Ramsgate harbour front. We had a variety of starters and sides including excellent bread, nice chips and vegetable dishes.

Fantastic views,There's no direct admission charge and it's £5 to park there (free for National Trust members). On a very hot day the breeze at the top was very refreshing and we enjoyed tremendous views not just over the Channel but of the ever busy Dover port as well.

Nice walk in town,We enjoyed a nice walk - 10 minutes or so each way along the pier in Deal's attractive town centre. A sunny day made for a lovely experience.

Good base in Ramsgate,"We had a very enjoyable couple of nights here. Our room was spacious enough for our needs and the hotel is well located with the beach, restaurants, town centre and other attractions all within walking distance. Parking is available at the multi-storey over the road but be aware all but the ground floor is locked overnight (e-mails from the hotel and a sign in reception do explain this).

Breakfast was typical Travelodge fare and set us up fine for the day. This area of the hotel is also well air conditioned. Unfortunately the rooms aren't and, although they give you a fan, due to the very hot weather, we also had to leave the window open which proved to be a bit noisy. In fairness, the general weather at the time was exceptionally hot for southern England.

I'd definitely stay here again.",July 2019,Travelodge Ramsgate Seafront,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186314-d2179816-Reviews-Travelodge_Ramsgate_Seafront-Ramsgate_Isle_of_Thanet_Kent_England.html,"Ramsgate, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent food and views,"We went with family members for a midweek dinner. The pub boasts superb views over the bay, even better from the upstairs dining room (not wheelchair accessible).

The food was of a very high standard with us really enjoying our baked camembert starter followed by grilled salmon and a vegetable tart with chips. Coffee was also of very good quality.

The only slight problem was the length of time it took for the drinks to arrive (not an issue with the food). This seemed more a problem with the bar downstairs rather than the waiting staff themselves.

Still a very nice evening overall though.",July 2019,Belle Vue Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186314-d1830357-Reviews-Belle_Vue_Tavern-Ramsgate_Isle_of_Thanet_Kent_England.html,"Ramsgate, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good coffee,Popped in here for an afternoon coffee stop whilst in the Lambs Conduit Street area and this proved a good choice.

Traditional tea shop,"Lovely tea shop next to the optician in BoC High Street. We had a very nice savoury cream tea with lovely cheese to spread and relish. Also a very nice warm scone and toasted crumpet. Service was very friendly as we sat out in the garden area. We also liked all the bric a brac to look at on the way in and out.
