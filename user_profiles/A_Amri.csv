Wow wow wow,"This is absolutely an amazing place! Check in is very easy and quick, staff very friendly and the apartment is clean and spacious. The location is unbelievable!!!! I highly recommend this apartment! One downside though is that the rooms facing the street get noisy, but otherwise a 5 star apartment.

Needs a major update,"Let’s start with the good:
-The lobby is magnificent, the hotel grounds are amazing and the check in was quick.
-After check in you go to a separate desk to place your breakfast order, you get a choice of oriental, American or kids breakfast which is delivered to your room in 1 hour increments from 6am-11am. The prestige suite was huge. You get a bedroom separate living room and 1.5 bathrooms.
-On the ground floor you get a big terrace that takes you straight into the garden, pool (closed due to Covid-19), and the beach.
-The shower had excellent and consistent pressure and temperature control.
-The breakfast quantity was HUGE! We opted for the oriental and 1 was enough for 2 people.
-The staff were all extremely friendly and professional.
Now unfortunately for the bad:
-The room was filthy, the “minibar” had pieces of food and the room corners were mouldy. When we complained though it was dealt with very professionally, the housekeeping manager came to inspect, ordered a recreating and sanitised the whole room and offered us complimentary stuff.
-The overall look of the room was tired and needed an update.
-The AC temperature control wasn’t very good or consistent and was quite outdated.
-It also was very surprising to see a luxurious 5 star hotel with old TVs that were not smart and had limited channels, with no access to things like Netflix or YouTube.
-The most disappointing and mind boggling thing was the “minibar”, which does not work in any room in the hotel (as advised),I was told that it just keeps things at room temperature (basically a cupboard with a light) and they provide an ice bucket if requested, very surprising and annoying on a hot summer day planned to be spent on the beach (only thing open during Covid-19).
Overall good 3 star hotel, decent 4 star hotel, but poor luxurious 5 star hotel with great friendly staff. What should separate this hotel from others is the attention to detail, but the lack of made me rate it poorly.
Finally I have to give a notable mention to Mr. Syed Fasiullah the housekeeping manager, he always went above and beyond for us, and made any of our complaints disappear and turned our frowns into smiles.",June 2020,Sofitel Bahrain Zallaq Thalassa Sea & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293997-d1770191-Reviews-Sofitel_Bahrain_Zallaq_Thalassa_Sea_Spa-Manama.html,"Manama, Bahrain",hotels,2.0,4.5

Best in Bahrain,"This is probably THE best restaurant in Bahrain! Almost anything you order will be amazing and the price is very reasonable!

Average Hotel+Excellent Staff= very good rating,"I think the title explains it all, stayed in the panorama suite, which is like 2 connecting rooms with one turned into a living room.
Stayed in the hotel for just 1 night so didn't manage to check out all the features.
The hotel looks really dull from outside and the inside isn't much better.
The rooms looked really tired and old and in need of a major upgrade.
The bathrooms and sheets and towels did not smell nice and clean as you would expect in a hotel like the intercontinental.
The area where I thought they excelled was the customer service, the staff were all very nice and helpful at all times.
I used the hotel parking and found it to be cheaper than other places in Frankfurt.
All in all a good hotel for a one nighter but there are better options out there.
This time a stayed here because of necessity as there was a convention in town and my usual hotel was full, doubt I will come back here unless faced with a similar situation, not because the hotel was particularly bad but because I prefer the other options out there.",May 2015,InterContinental Frankfurt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187337-d230574-Reviews-InterContinental_Frankfurt-Frankfurt_Hesse.html,"Frankfurt, Germany",hotels,4.0,4.0
Very close to excellence,"This is a great hotel and could easily become excellent. We arrived the hotel in the late afternoon, parked my car up front and handed my keys to the concierge as is the procedure if no one will remain in the car.
The check-in was quick and the staff were friendly and they were expecting me.
We stayed in the king junior suite, and it was pretty much flawless, we even got a complimentary fruit and chocolate tray and a bottle of water.
The suite was quite spacious and the living room was separated from the bedroom with two sliding doors.
With the suite we got access to the executive lounge, but we didn’t really take advantage of it.
The breakfast was excellent and the staff were really friendly and attentive, even though they were quite short of staff when we were there, but we didn’t feel it at all, the bakery at breakfast was amazing.
The hotel location is very good as well, a couple of minutes walk from Frankfurt’s largest shopping street, but remember all the stores are closed in Germany on Sundays by law.
This is without a question the best hotel we stayed in during our eurotrip, but unfortunately its not perfect.
The sad thing is that the hotel’s flaws can very easily be rectified if they wished to do so.
For starters the parking price for hotel guests is ridiculous. I think it was something like 30 euros a day, but luckily it was a Friday evening, and there are some free spots on the weekend right in front of the hotel, not many but not impossible to find one.
Secondly this was the first hotel I ever stayed in that did not provide complimentary water every day for its guests.
And lastly the worst and silliest part of this hotel is the unbelievable price they put on wifi, didn’t know there were good hotels that still charged for wifi.

Other than these sadly easily and cheaply rectifiable cons, this is an excellent hotel.",March 2015,Hilton Frankfurt City Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187337-d228375-Reviews-Hilton_Frankfurt_City_Centre-Frankfurt_Hesse.html,"Frankfurt, Germany",hotels,4.0,4.0
"A typical European hotel, and not in a good way","Average hotel at best, especially for the price we paid, it had some good pros but unfortunately some disappointing cons as well.

Firstly we checked in the hotel at 4pm, the check in process was quick and the staff were friendly, we took our suitcases up ourselves as there was no one there to help, but they do provide you with a trolly.

When we got to the room (we took a superior suite) it was a complete mess, someone had checked out and the room was not cleaned, food trays in the rooms, towels on the floor, and beds were used, we called the reception and they gave us an insincere apology and changed our room.

The new room was spotless, very clean and comfortable, the superior suite has a separate living room that can be closed off from the bedroom by two large doors, the bathroom can be accessed from either the living room or bedroom as it has doors at either side, in the bathroom you have two sinks and a heated towel rack that heats up the whole bathroom which was very nice, as well you have a separate little room for the toilet with a door and on the other side you have the shower with its own door as well.
The bed was pretty comfortable but it is actually to separate mattresses that are put together (so you cant really sleep in the middle) and you get two quilts.
Also the room was about 160 steps away from the elevator, which was inconvenient especially while dragging suitcases and carrying a baby, there is a closer elevator but it doesn't take you down to the lobby (clear design flaw).

You also get a little patio which was nice, also the room wasn't particularly quiet nor noisy.
Free wifi is available but it is practically useless, so ended up using my phones data, you can get a local chip for about 15 euros, just make sure you get something other than O2, as it is as useless as the hotels wifi.

The breakfast buffet was quite good, everything was clearly labelled in German, English and Arabic, I had ordered the same omelet on 3 different days, and each day I got a different omelet and none of the days was it what I had ordered.
They also have a coffee and hot water (for tea) machine, so you pretty much serve yourself.

The hotel location is pretty good, nothing is too far away, they even have a small supermarket attached to the hotel.

The parking price is absolutely ridiculous! I asked the receptionist if they had any free parking around the hotel and he told me that I would have to just look for one on the street, but later on another receptionist advised me of a free parking lot right next to the hotel and I am very grateful to her.

We Also once asked room service to bring us an empty plate and they advised us that it would cost us 4 euros, or we could just go down and collect it from the bar ourselves for free.

The hotel is clearly a business hotel, as there were many people in business suits in the lobby at most times of the day, conferences and also would occasionally have meetings at the breakfast buffet.

Directions to the free parking lot: Once you exit the hotel walk to the road, at the road turn left and walk for about a minute, you will find the parking lot on your right.
The parking lot is free and safe but still use your common sense and don't leave your valuables clearly visible in your car.
They also sometimes block a few parkings in the parking lot, but all the other parkings are free for use.",March 2015,Pullman Hotel Munich,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187309-d199631-Reviews-Pullman_Hotel_Munich-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,"Munich, Germany",hotels,3.0,4.0
Easter brunch,"The Easter brunch was simply amazing, they officially start brunches on the 10th of April, but they had an earlier brunch specifically for Easter, and it is one of the best buffets I have had in Bahrain, with many different stations.
The Sushi/seafood station was amazing, they also had a great Indian station with fresh tandoori done right in front of you, a homemade pasta station made to order, a grill station as well made to order, a middle eastern station with fresh shawarmas made to order, a Chinese/Asian station, and amazing dessert station (always remember to keep room) and much more.
We will definitely be regulars here, plus the service was really really good.
The only flaw I found was the parking area, the entrances were not clearly marked and so you are not quite sure where to park your car.
I don't give 5 stars very often but this deserved it, enjoy.",April 2015,Four Seasons Hotel Bahrain Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293997-d7176193-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Bahrain_Bay-Manama.html,"Manama, Bahrain",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Good but not ""Magnifique""","First things first,the hotel staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful, and the hotel was always nice and clean.
We stayed in the Opera suite during our stay in Sofitel.
The suite was nice, you get a separate living room with a half bathroom, a patio and a direct access to the pool.
In the sitting room you get a small table with 2 chairs and a sofa (I'm sure it has another name other than sofa) which is very comfortable to lay down on but not so much to sit down on ( a couch would have done a big difference in my opinion).
The rooms were good but to be honest I expected much more, there was only one phone in the bedroom, which was a nuisance especially if my son was asleep in the bedroom and we wanted to order room service or call for house keeping.
The bathrooms were good as well with a bath separate from a shower, but again we were disappointed that the toilets did not have a bidet or a sprinkler as most hotels in Thailand that I've been to have.
Some areas of the exterior looked very tired and worn and not what you would expect from a 5 star resort, the hotel grounds were very dark at night as well.
The hotel food wasn't very consistent and would sometimes be disappointing, the breakfast buffet was good but not as good as other Sofitel hotels that I've been to, but on the other hand none of them were as busy as this hotel, so I guess quality had to suffer a bit, but you would still find everything you want and it was always good ( don't miss the pan au chocolate and doughnuts).
Room service was not that good and was disappointed by the pizza we ordered on one night. Walked in to the Thai restaurant, checked the menu and walked right out, but the good news is that there are many authentic Thai restaurants close by, either a 15 minute walk away or a 3 minute tuktuk ride for the good places (check out my other reviews).
The pool area was really good but it could sometimes get a bit difficult to find a good spot to sit as many guests come and put their stuff on chairs and leave.
The beach isn't great, but I understand it is situated on a national reserve and the law forbids the hotel altering it in any way, but the good news is that good beaches are not far away.
The hotel had an activity board that was updated every day which was very nice.
They had a very good kids zone and baby sitter services (but we didn't try them out) all in all the hotel was very children friendly, and this for me would be the main reason to come back.
And I believe twice a week they have BBQ night with a live show, which is very interesting.
So my final conclusion is that the Sofitel was very good, with some room for improvement, and unfortunately you don't really get the magnifique experience that they promise.",January 2015,Sofitel Krabi Phokeethra Golf & Spa Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3175953-d622637-Reviews-Sofitel_Krabi_Phokeethra_Golf_Spa_Resort-Nong_Thale_Krabi_Town_Krabi_Province.html,"Nong Thale, Thailand",hotels,4.0,4.5
Best mall in Bahrain,"Bahrain city center is basically the best mall in Bahrain, lots of shops, nice atmosphere and great eating options.
The cinema is good but with room for improvement.
The parking lay out is so bad that it is funny, seems like it was designed by a clown on LSD, but other than that this is my favorite mall in Bahrain.
Word of caution though, it can get quite busy and unbearable during the weekends and public holidays.",February 2015,City Centre Bahrain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293997-d1811878-Reviews-City_Centre_Bahrain-Manama.html,"Manama, Bahrain",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Excellent food, terrible service","For one of the best if not the best food in Bahrain come to Cocos.
I've been coming to cocos for about 10 years now and they have consistently provided exceptionally good food, the menu hasn't changed much if at all in the last 10 years but I guess ""if it ain't broke why fix it?"", so why the low rating?
The service is terrible, one of the worst I've experienced in Bahrain.
Not only is it very slow, and when I say slow I mean SLOW (you can wait for 45-60 minutes to get your order) but the staff are quite rude at times.
It also gets very busy ( due to the exceptionally good food) , you could wait for 30 minutes or more just to get a table during peak times, so if you come here make sure you have at least a couple of hours, a couple of times I had to leave after waiting for about an hour for my food because I just couldn't wait any more.
Some recommendations: to start the chicken broccoli soup, chicken mushroom soup and cocos salad (even though the portion has significantly reduced) are great, for mains I would suggest the Lahina, Swahili or spicy chicken, for dessert the caramel date cake is great and for drinks the peach ice tea is a favorite, but honestly you can't go wrong with whatever you choose.
I would also suggest you go at off peak times, peak times are obviously lunch and dinner times and especially the weekends, the best time for me would be a late lunch, as it is much quieter.
So for excellent food at a reasonable price but terrible service go to Cocos.",January 2015,Coco's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293997-d805433-Reviews-Coco_s-Manama.html,"Manama, Bahrain",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Not Bad,"I dined in the Holiday Inn branch, the set up is a bit awkward, with an open seating area next to the entrance of the hotel, there is a small semi private non smoking seating area with about 3-4 tables, 2 of which are 2 seaters.
The food was good and the complimentary green is a nice touch.
Had the California maki, spicy volcano maki and a vegetarian noodles.
The California Maki was good but wasn't packed neatly and tightly as Makis usually are, the volcano wasn't bad, and the noodles was average.
All in all nice food but with room for improvement, not much of an ambiance, and wouldn't travel far to eat here, basically a nice place to dine if you are next to it and in the mood for Japanese.",February 2015,Sakura - Holiday Inn Salmiya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g488160-d4154227-Reviews-Sakura_Holiday_Inn_Salmiya-Salmiya_Hawalli_Governorate.html,"Salmiya, Kuwait",restaurants,3.0,4.5

Beautiful !,"The best advice you could get is to buy your tickets online, unfortunately for me this didn't work, I tried for 2 days to buy the tickets online but they wouldn't accept the payment, I was using a Visa.
Finally decided to do it the old fashioned way and hit the queue.
The queue took me 1 hour, and just a quick tip, you can usually catch a free wifi while in the queue.
Arrived to the front of the queue at 1230 and got a ticket for 1330 at the earliest, but heard some people in the next window who wanted to go up the towers and the earliest visit time they got was 1830.
The audio guide is highly recommended.
Also be advised that if you have children under the age of 6, you won't be allowed in the towers.
Another tip is to take in some water with you, as we spent about 2 hours admiring the basilica without even realising it, and no drinks or snacks were sold inside.
The Basilica is beautiful from the outside and the inside, only built by the fees they receive from entrance fees and private donations.
All in all a must if you are in Barcelona, and hopefully you will be more successful purchasing your tickets online.",September 2014,Basilica of the Sagrada Familia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190166-Reviews-Basilica_of_the_Sagrada_Familia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,4.0,4.5
Interesting park,"Quite an interesting and different park, interesting works of art by Gaudi, but don't expect too much.
The park isn't as big as you would think and not as much to see as you would think.
As everyone suggested, you SHOULD get your tickets online.
Once in, there is another long queue to enter Gaudi's house, and next to the house they have a cafeteria with not so good over priced snacks and drinks, and public restrooms.
A word of caution: getting to the park requires ALOT of uphill walking, so be prepared, and the closest metro is about a 15 minute walk.

Very good vegetarian food but not moroccan,"Decided to come here since my wife is both a vegetarian and a moroccan. Came here with my wife, our 7 month old son and my wife's brother, the place is very easy to miss even if you are specifically looking for it.
The place is very small but went there at around 4 in the afternoon so it was pretty quiet.
They provided us with an english menu which was very helpful, most of the food comes in like a pie form with a vegetarian filling, kind of like the moroccan Pastillas but not quite ( since they use bread instead of the pastillas pastry). Us 2 guys took the four seasons since this was the most appealing for a none vegetarian and my wife took the tofu, the tofu was quite good but the four seasons was really really good and highly recommended, the 3 of us agreed that the four seasons was the way to go and that the only thing moroccan about this place was the music.
Be advised that the ""pies"" are quite filling, so if you don't have a big appetite you might want to share, we ended up taking half a pie back home with us ( they wrap it up in aluminium foil for you).

Amazing location but...,"Came here for a weekend with my wife, initial reaction was ""wooow"" but unfortunately it wasn't all good.

Pros: Great location, amazing beaches, great and clean rooms with a beautiful view and an overall comfortable stay.

Cons: Everything was over priced, A decent meal for two where you would expect to pay about 50 euros at any of the top restaurants in Muscat would cost you about double that.
a simple vegetarian sandwich (which was just a salad between 2 slices of bread) would cost you about 16 euros.
swimming trunks at the gift shop would set you back about 100 euros!
Service was absolutely terrible! I don't think they could have provided a slower service if they tried! Sat down for breakfast (at the very dissapointing breakfast buffet) and ordered an egg white omelette as they do not have an egg station, and by the time we left about 35 minutes later, the omelette still hadn't arrived.
Ordered a plate of fries and a couple of drinks at 1 of the private beaches, and I kid you not, it took about 40 minutes to arrive!

Honestly just average,"My wife and me stayed here for a couple of nights on our way back from Siem Reap. We asked for the hotel to pick us up and they were there waiting for us as we exited.
Only hotel in Cambodia so far that did not offer refreshments or cold towels in the car, but this was offered upon check in
On check in the manager was close by working on the computer, he glanced at us and then continued working, no “welcome” or “hello”, which I found very strange, especially for Cambodia and even more so for a boutique hotel.
We got to our junior sweet and the room was quite nice and clean, bigger than the other hotels I stayed in, but looked a bit tired.
The breakfast was limited, but I thought the little they did, they did well.
I asked for an iron on my last night, and I must have gotten the smallest iron board in Cambodia with an iron that had a hilariously short cord, was very frustrating to try an iron with that thing.
The service was so and so, and the staff were not as competent as I’ve seen in other places.
I checked out around 8pm, so my room was booked for an extra day, I explained this a couple of times to the front desk, but they still seemed confused when I told them I'm checking out that night.
I asked for the hotel car to the airport but as I checked out I was told they got me a taxi, it wasn't a big deal but it was just another example of the so and so service.
Anyway the check out took about 10-15 minutes I think; because of all the confusion.
All in all it was an all right place to stay, but I wouldn't come back, not because anything was particularly disappointing, but because I’ve seen much better in PP.

Beautiful,"We came here at around 5am for the sunrise, but unfortunately it was a cloudy morning and we couldn't see it. Even at that time of the day the place is filled with tourists and shop owners trying to get you to have breakfast at their stall (they later get replaced with scarf, fridge magnet and travel book sellers).
Never the less its an absolute must and jaw dropping, especially after you wrap your head around the fact that this was the center of the worlds largest city until the industrial revolution! Home to approximately 1 million people, and it was all built around 1,000 years ago!
The temple itself is a wonder and I think many people forget the fact that the moat surrounding the temple was also man made around 1,000 years ago, which I find to be another wonder all on its own.
My suggestion is to watch a documentary of the temple before visiting (national geographic have a great one) and many hotels did have DVDs with these documentaries in the rooms, well at least mine did and it was very helpful.",May 2013,Angkor Wat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d317907-Reviews-Angkor_Wat-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,5.0

We left with empty stomaches, so far this was the only place in Cambodia where the food was less than satisfying and where the food took almost 30 minutes to get to our table.

We were picked up from the hotel and as we arrived we were welcomed and given a safety brief by the most unpleasant cambodian, it seemed he really had an attitude problem (don't worry it gets better, it really does deserve 5 stars), then we were taken out for a test ride, but as soon as we got out of the garage, it started pouring down! so we went back and cancelled the ride.
Came back a few days later and met a delightful host, who went over the safety brief once again but this time very briefly because I went through it all before, then we did the short test drive and came back to pay for the tour and go off. I took the 2 hour tour and the only disappointment I had was that I didn't do a longer one.
My guide Mr. Koy was fantastic, he even took me to his home to see how the real cambodians live, and I think this was the highlight of the tour.
This was the only activity that I say that it is a must in Siem Reap and that you should not avoid it at any cost!
And when you go you should ask for Mr. Koy, he will make sure you wont get disappointed.
Make sure you take lots of candy for the kids you meet in the villages.
I went just after it rained so the roads were not dusty, so i'm guessing it is best to go after the rains.",May 2013,Siem Reap Quad Bike Adventure ATV Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d2390571-Reviews-Siem_Reap_Quad_Bike_Adventure_ATV_Tours-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great food,"We were really looking forward to eating at friends after we read the reviews on TA. We called them last night to make a reservation but they were fully booked so we decided to just walk in and try our luck. We go there and we were seated immediately but the place as indeed packed.
The food was very good and atmosphere as good as well. I would recommend this place but I personally enjoyed my meal more at their sister restaurant Romdeng.
My advice is that you MUST go to both while in PP and always leave room for dessert!",May 2013,Friends the Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293940-d1202023-Reviews-Friends_the_Restaurant-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Best in Phnom Penh,"We came here for lunch after Friends was closed for training, but it wasn't a big change of plans as we were planing to come here for dinner anyway.
This was some of the best food we had in Cambodia and definitely the best in PP. This was the first place we ate in in Cambodia when we arrived and the last just before leaving. The Amok fish is highly recommended, the pickled lime soda was a new experience, it was salty and sweet at the same time, but it was part of the weekly specials. My 1 piece of advice, ALWAYS ALWAYS leave room for dessert, the banana dumplings were amazing, but also part of the weekly specials.
I think this restaurant should move to number one.",May 2013,Romdeng,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293940-d1217419-Reviews-Romdeng-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great hotel, excellent staff.","We stayed in the hotel for 4 nights checking out on 19/05/2013. I contacted them via email to give them my flight details so that they could pick me up, but unfortunately I got no response, so i tried another 2 times but still nothing, so I finally decided to call them, someone answered and barely heard them because of the very noisy background (sounded like they were in a market) but I managed to get my details across. And that is where the disappointments ended.
Ms. Bunna apologising for the late response and confirming my pick up sent me an email.
I was met in the airport by the most delightful cambodians you will ever meet Mr. Alex and our driver Mr. Ley.
A very warm welcome later and a quick explanation of the city and we were in the hotel.
The Privilege Floor is located on the 4th floor of the Borei Angkor hotel.
As other users said the hotel premises isn't impressive but the Privilege Floor makes up for this in other areas.
We were met by Ms. Bunna who once again apologised for the email issue, then explained the hotel facilities which include free mini bar, free wifi, free laundry,mobile phone, breakfast, cocktails, and most importantly a driver 24/7.
The Premier Double Room was of good size, with a small balcony and a lovely bathroom where the shower and the beautiful bathtub are separate.
You can choose to have breakfast at the lobby (wider selection but nothing special) or at the Damnak lounge, which is on the 4th floor (small selection but had everything I needed). The biggest issue I had with the breakfast that the bread was always stale, but I would suggest to have the breakfast here if for no other reason but to meet Mr. Say, the nicest guy you will ever meet, and who would always try to make your stay more pleasurable (he made sure we had a fresh cold fruit platter waiting for us in our room whenever we got back from the temples).
The pool area was very good and we used it once. My wife took the massage in the spa and that was very good as well.
The evening cocktails served between 1700-1900 were a great way to spend some time and have some good snacks before dinner and as an added bonus you get to meet the wonderful Mr. Sokman who even prepared some great vegetarian snacks for my wife, he was just a delight and worth going to the Damnak lounge to just meet him if for nothing else.
I stayed in quite a few hotels in Cambodia and even more around the world, but the privilege floor has by far the best staff i've ever met and so I think they deserve a special mention.
I think Cambodia’s real treasure is its people and The Privilege Floor has the crème de la crème.
So thank you Mr. Alex and Ms. Bunna for making our stay amazing and making sure everywhere we went would cater to our special needs even though we didn't ask (My wife is a vegetarian, I don't eat pork , ...etc) , thank you Mr. Say for making our breakfast that more pleasant and for giving us that hand written list of some important Cambodian words translated to english, Thank you Mr. Sokman for making our evening cocktails that more fun and making us laugh all the time and finally thank you Mr. Ley for not only being our driver but also being our tour guide for 4 great days.
I enjoyed my stay here so much so that it forced me from just reading reviews for years to writing my first one.",May 2013,THE PRIVILEGE FLOOR by Borei Angkor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297390-d2350683-Reviews-THE_PRIVILEGE_FLOOR_by_Borei_Angkor-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",hotels,5.0,5.0
Great hotel,"Stayed in the Sofitel for a couple of nights only. I asked them to pick me up from the hotel and they were waiting for me as I exited. Cold water and Cold towels were waiting for us when we entered the car. We asked for the BMW, which was good and comfortable but was difficult to accommodate our luggage (we had 2 big bags, they were empty but big) so on the way back we took the Hyundai H1.
The staff welcomed us with cold lemongrass tea and cold towels as we arrived. We took the luxury King room and upon check in they asked us if we would like the club millesime benefits, which included breakfast and wifi for $75 and we agreed.
On the second day we booked a tuktuk from the hotel for half a day to take us to all the sites for about $17 and that was good, but I think if you get someone from outside it would be cheaper.
We had dinner at the Italian restaurant, the food was good but nothing special, except for the tiramisu, which I thought, was absolutely amazing, the best I’ve ever had.
The breakfast buffet was hands down the best we have ever had and I have had breakfast in hotels from LA to Manila and many places in between, and the only competition was a buffet I had in a hotel in Dubai.
The pool area was very good and they provide you with a complimentary cold bottle of water.
Staffs were always very helpful as well.
I would definitely stay here in my next time in Phnom Penh and I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone I know.",May 2013,Sofitel Phnom Penh Phokeethra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293940-d1784730-Reviews-Sofitel_Phnom_Penh_Phokeethra-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Just alright,"Nothing special, just some old artefacts which you are not allowed to take pictures of, you can finish the museum in about 10 minutes, and since we saw much more in Siem Reaps temples, this was a waste of time and money.",May 2013,National Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293940-d324624-Reviews-National_Museum-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",attractions,3.0,4.0

Excellent food and wonderful service,"Me and wife came here a couple of nights ago based on TA reviews and we were not disappointed.
Our hotel advised them about 10 minutes before we arrived that my wife was a vegetarian and by the time we got there they had a whole menu for her!
We were greeted by whom I think was the owner (lovely french lady), and she explained the menu and the hotel theme for us, then she got the chef (very friendly french guy) who came out and explained the special veg. menu for my wife.
Out of the 5 courses we had 3 were out of this world and 2 were very good.
The seating area is very good as well, we sat inside but I think next time we would prefer to sit upstairs.
Highly recommended,please don't miss out.",May 2013,Cuisine Wat Damnak,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d2021626-Reviews-Cuisine_Wat_Damnak-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
