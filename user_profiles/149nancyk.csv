Must see,"Whether or not you climbed up to the Acropolis, the museum is a must. It is beautifully done! You will see some of the original work and reproductions that bring the stones to life. Even before you enter the building you are walking over the ancient streets of Athens and viewing them through glass beneath your feet.",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Go early in the morning,"A visit to the Athens acropolis is a must, but be aware that there are many stairs and the ground is uneven. We went with a tour very early, and I'm glad we did. By the time we were heading down, it was hard to make headway against the upward migration.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Sparta, Mystras, Diros Caves and Olympia","My husband and I booked this tour to continue our Greek experience after a cruise of the Greek Islands. We were met at the pier as arranged by our driver, Giorgos. We quickly took care of the business end of things and were off on our two night adventure. Giorgos was both an excellent driver and a a fund of information on things Greek. He told us about the area where we were driving and an outline of what we would find at our stops. He also took us to good places to eat for lunch. The first day it was a place of his choosing. On the second day we were ready to eat long before his selected lunch stop, so he kindly pulled into an outdoor eatery we were passing in a very small town. This turned out to be a great choice, although I'm sure the place were headed would have had good food too. Our evening on our own in Sparta turned out to be very memorable as we strolled the town and took supper at the town square where we could see the local citizens enjoying a warm fall Friday evening. A highlight of the sights on the tour was the location where the Olympic torch is lit before each modern Olympics.
Most important is that everything was provided as advertised. The hotels were the ones we had been told (the information said, or similar, but there were no substitutions). I'd looked them up so knew what to expect: clean and basic. No complaints. Another time I'd ask for an upgrade to have a bit more space. As for the sightseeing, I would consider asking for a local licensed guide to show us around, especially Spata. The ancient city is pretty much piles of rocks, so it would have been nice to have someone bring this stones to life for us. (The driver is not a guide so cannot do this.)
Thank you to Athens Tours Greece for three memorable days!",October 2019,Athens Tours Greece,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2165694-Reviews-Athens_Tours_Greece-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Family kayaking,"We were a family of 8 ranging in age from 7 To 74 many of us first timers. We had a beautiful sunny day with calm seas so perfect for us. Jaycee took us first to see some turtles and then up the river for a pleasant paddle. He also manned one of our cameras so we now have some memorable pictures.

The little guys 7 and 10 found the going hard but enjoyed the challenge. As first timers some of us were unaware of how exposed our legs would be and got quite sunburned. Lesson: use lots of sunscreen or cover up!

It is an experience I'd like to repeat ( minus the sunburn), and would recommend this company. We heard they plan to move to a more permanent location which should add to the pleasure of the experience.",August 2017,Sea and Board Sports Hawaii,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60647-d4360101-Reviews-Sea_and_Board_Sports_Hawaii-Haleiwa_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",attractions,5.0,5.0
Right place at the right time,We were driving in from the airport and stopped in Haleiwa for lunch. We first approached the place next door but seating was not available. At Kono's we sat outside and ate our choices of pork dishes. I had Pig on Grass i.e. salad topped with pork. It was good. We were glad we found this place for a casual lunch.,August 2017,Kono's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60647-d1379943-Reviews-Kono_s-Haleiwa_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Lunch after kayaking,"We 8 went kayaking across the street in the morning, and this is wear we ate lunch. It was suggested by the kayak people. We were hesitant to go as it looks rather nice from the outside (and inside too) and we were dressed in still damp swimsuits with shirts thrown on top. They said we were fine as long as we were covered and wore shoes. Glad we could be seated and enjoy a meal together.",August 2017,Haleiwa Beach House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60647-d10121847-Reviews-Haleiwa_Beach_House-Haleiwa_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fun for the whole family,"We went as a family group of 7 ages 7 to 74 and we all had a great time. Our guides were excellent and encouraging, so everyone felt ok with what they did. Gear was in perfect shape and we always felt safe. All but the two youngest, 7 and 10, had been on a Zipline before, but we were far from seasoned zippers, and we all finished with big smiles and memories of views and new information and challenges met.",August 2017,CLIMB Works Keana Farms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60651-d6748771-Reviews-CLIMB_Works_Keana_Farms-Kahuku_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",attractions,5.0,5.0
Tasty meal on Sunday,"Our first night in Kahuku was a Sunday and on Sundays their are few eateries open in the town. We were lucky to find Giovanni's food truck.

Life saver,"We needed food on Sunday. Foodland in Laie was closed, but the superette was open! We could find what we needed to get us through breakfast the next day: milk, bread, frozen berries cold cereal, shampoo plus a decent selection of wines. This last proved important the next day when we tried to get wine at Foodland in Laie.

An uneven experience,"I went to shine this evening with a rather large party. The staff did well arranging for us and with keeping the orders and checks straight. I ordered the Rocky Mt Mai Tai, an interesting taste and strong, beet hummus, really good, and ravioli, oily and not great. My ravioli was late in coming so I asked after it; it was coming. My friends were all finishing up, so asked a couple more times. When it came it was virtually thrown onto the table. This shocked me and my companions, plus I had to eat rather quickly. A sad end to the meal.",May 2016,Shine Restaurant & Potion Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33324-d3163130-Reviews-Shine_Restaurant_Potion_Bar-Boulder_Colorado.html,"Boulder, Colorado",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Good for our purpose,This hotel was recommended to us as a good one near family we were visiting. We pretty much used it for sleeping and eating breakfast. Everything about our stay was good. Be aware that lots of families may be staying creating occasional noise in the hall. Breakfast at the Tusca was expensive but the quality very good.,July 2015,Hyatt Regency Santa Clara,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33046-d79963-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Santa_Clara-Santa_Clara_California.html,"Santa Clara, California",hotels,5.0,4.0
