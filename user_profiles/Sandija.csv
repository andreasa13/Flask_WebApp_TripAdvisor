Magical,It is an amazing place. I definitely would recommend to get a guide or as I did - download an audio guide (I got the Rick Steves audio guide),February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fun and exciting,"Absolutely loved the tour around Athens with Jimmy. Really helped to understand more about the city, itâ€™s origins and people. 10 out of 10. And did I mention it is a lot of fun?",February 2020,Urban Free Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d11950666-Reviews-Urban_Free_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Aaaaaamazing,"Definitely 10 out of 10. Very comfortable, clean, bright, nice! So much stuff provided - chargers, books, Netflix, coffee all day long, pasta and vegetables etc. It has a great bar, yard and garden. And all the people working there - 100 out of 10. They pay attention to details - from earplugs and hairdryers to allowing to change a dorm bed, if the bottom one gets free. Well, I could not recommend this place more.",January 2020,Ostello Bello Lake Como,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187835-d12406084-Reviews-Ostello_Bello_Lake_Como-Como_Lake_Como_Lombardy.html,"Como, Italy",hotels,5.0,5.0
"Amazing house, people and location","I extended my stay in Diani beach, because I just felt SO good in this place. It is very comfortable, beautiful (paying attention to smallest details), relaxing, easy going and really close to the beach. Super nice lounge area in the house and in garden and pool area. Food was delicious, all staff friendly and helpful (special greeting to Ruth), owners Risha and Fahad really great - helped me with lot of advises, suggestions, tours and even train ticket booking. And Lucy - just the best. Well - I do not have a single bad word to say about Footprint house. Loved it completely from beginning till end :)",February 2018,Footprints House Diani Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g775870-d12409645-Reviews-Footprints_House_Diani_Beach-Diani_Beach_Ukunda_Coast_Province.html,"Diani Beach, Kenya",hotels,5.0,5.0
Lovely and friendly place,"During my one month travel period in Kenya, I stayed in Karen camp for three times. The owners and the staff are very friendly and ready to help with anything. The thing I really appreciated was that - if they are not fully booked, they try to accommodate solo travelers in separate dorms (although it would be easier for them to pack everybody in one room), so everybody gets more private space. The bar area and garden were super nice to have a meal, a beer and meet people. It is safe, clean and relaxed. It is not in the center of Nairobi, but for my case i was not disadvantage at all.",January 2018,Karen Camp,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294207-d1392605-Reviews-Karen_Camp-Nairobi.html,"Nairobi, Kenya",hotels,5.0,3.5
Very good value for money,"I liked the Jambo house a lot. It is clean, comfortable, affordable, very well located, the terrace is just adorable, breakfast is very good. Arnold is super helpful and can give you a lot of information about places to eat, what to do and to see. I really enjoyed my time in Jambo house and in Lamu.",February 2018,JamboHouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294208-d1574437-Reviews-JamboHouse-Lamu_Island_Coast_Province.html,"Lamu Island, Kenya",hotels,5.0,4.5
It was a great day on a great island with a great guide,"We were a group of 9 people with quite different interests. But one thing we all were sure of - a day in Malta with Therese was absolutely great.
It is not only about and because of good and thoughtful route and beautiful places we saw, but mostly because of Therese - we could discuss different aspects of Malta's history and nowadays. She is friendly, easy going, with her opinion and good sense of humor. We also loved our lunch in a local cafe with delicious food, far from any tourist eateries. We would definitely recommend Karlito's way, if you want to get to know Malta in a very relaxed, friendly and still very informative way.",January 2018,Karlito's Way,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190328-d4301332-Reviews-Karlito_s_Way-Valletta_Island_of_Malta.html,"Island of Malta, Malta",attractions,5.0,5.0
Excellent food and interior,"One of the best tuna steaks in my life, good service, great atmosphere! I would suggest to make a reservation first.",February 2017,MO Liepaja,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274965-d11933399-Reviews-MO_Liepaja-Liepaja_Kurzeme_Region.html,"Liepaja, Latvia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Best way and place to explore The Great China wall,"Loved the place. Comfortable, super clean, tasteful and very welcoming.
The wall at Gubeiko is not renovated, which means that at the moment you can get there wonderful hikes around the wall without hardly meeting any other person. Well, I met just a huge rabbit on my way.
Great Wall Box House may seem a bit pricey, if you are backpacking, but it is totally worth it. Great relaxation, great views and vegetarian dinners (and I am not even a vegetarian) are something.
And best regards to Ms.Hong for all your help and just welcoming atitude.

Q Bungalows - definatelly recomend,"I loved the place. Close to the Crab Market. Staff sooo friendly and hopeful, rooms and bungalows really nice, clean and fresh. Pool amazing. Atmosphere relaxed. Got stuck there longer than planned. I absolutely do recomend this place!",April 2013,Q Bungalows,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608456-d3753954-Reviews-Q_Bungalows-Kep_Kep_Province.html,"Kep, Cambodia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Cave Lodge - highly recommend,"I stayed in Cave Lodge for 3 wonderful days and nights. The accomodation is fine, but the best you get from the place is the great atmosphere, local people working there and of course amazing trekks. We did caving and it is one of the greatest experiences in my travel. Just be opened - ask the menegment (the owner was on vacations, so in cave Lodge I met his daughter Mindy) more about the place, tribes, history... and you will get the magnificent feeling of the place. And spend some time reading ""Wild Times"" - book written by the founder of Cave Lodge and his 30 years spent in this area, all the discovered caves, adventures etc.",February 2013,Cave Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1753701-d1232789-Reviews-Cave_Lodge-Soppong_Mae_Hong_Son_Province.html,"Soppong, Thailand",hotels,5.0,4.0
