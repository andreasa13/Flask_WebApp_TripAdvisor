"Clean, Beautiful, a Great Place to Wander!","Plaka is very clean compared to much of Athens and there is a distinct lack of graffiti compared to many areas. The shops are many and interesting, and generally the feel of the area is that it is safe.",October 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing!,"Awe inspiring and intriguing, but needed the knowledge and enthusiasm of a tour guide to fill in all the details not provided in the monument.",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Beautiful and Timeless!,"An awe-inspiring monument which demonstrates the intelligence of the folk at the time in being able to build such columns etc. It does help to have a guide though, to fill in all the missing details not available around the monument.",September 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Interesting Detail,"A number of interesting exhibits, many of which had been restored so that the viewers could see it's original state rather than only what remained.

A Great Learning Experience!,"Costas our tour guide was a wealth of knowledge and his English was superb. His knowledge of Greek history and mythology was exceptional and made for an outstanding tour. Without the knowledge and insight of guides like Costas much of the city is columns and ruins without explanation, so you've no clue as to what you are looking at. There were a few welcome stops throughout the day, but it's a pretty full-on five hours, be prepared to walk! In this particular case, it's not called a walking tour for nothing!
My only negative was the timing. The walk up to the Acropolis is not easy and there are many steps which we were climbing at about 12:30, reaching the top at about 13:00 I think, so making it to the highest point at nearly the hottest point of the day - a time at which should only be enjoyed by mad dogs and Englishmen, don't they say?! I feel the Acropolis Museum could have been visited before the Acropolis itself as then we would have been climbing a bit later as the afternoon cooled.",September 2019,"The Acropolis, Athens Walking City Tour and Acropolis Museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d13225356-The_Acropolis_Athens_Walking_City_Tour_and_Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,4.0,5.0
Interesting!,"Not too much to look at in reality, but worth a climb to the top ramparts for the view if you have a few spare minutes to fill.",September 2018,Essaouira Ramparts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298349-d479062-Reviews-Essaouira_Ramparts-Essaouira_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Essaouira, Morocco",attractions,4.0,4.5
Don't be Fooled by the Pretty Pictures on TripAdvisor!,"This place is filthy, smelly and generally a real let-down.

Amazing Food!,"My husband and I chose the set menu and had the Moroccan soup to start, the beef tenderloin for our main and fruit salad for dessert. The food was amazing and the beef was indeed very tender! The restaurant was extremely busy with a queue at 20:00 waiting to be seated, then a further queue waiting until 22:00! Even so, we didn't feel rushed to eat and were able to enjoy our meal. Due to the fact that as many tables as possible are fitted into the restaurant and everyone is very close together, my husband in particular did get quite hot and we were relieved to get out into the fresh air. Negotiating your way through the tables is quite difficult if you need to use the convenience once you've been seated, it requires coordination with the next table to get through, but other than that it was perfect.",September 2018,Restaurant Adwak,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298349-d5994887-Reviews-Restaurant_Adwak-Essaouira_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Essaouira, Morocco",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wonderful Bikes!,"We arranged to hire bikes through our hotel - Villa Quieta, and they were delivered the next day at 10:00 as arranged. They were both fantastic bikes, brand new and extremely easy to use it terms of gears. They were both Giselle bikes, one male and one female and were really comfortable providing for a sitting upright posture instead of having to lean forward which personally gives me backache. My husband and I had a great time riding up and down the promenade in Essaouira, we also went into the Medina and had a coffee in the square before then cycling to the supermarket to stock up on a few snacks for the next day and our flight home, before then returning to the hotel where we left the bikes for collection again that evening! Very good efficient service, I would not hesitate to recommend Essaouira e-bikes.",September 2018,Essaouira E-bikes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298349-d15097063-Reviews-Essaouira_E_bikes-Essaouira_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Essaouira, Morocco",attractions,5.0,5.0
Amazing Toubkal!,"Our Riad in Marrakech arranged this day trek for us, we were collected by our walking guide in Imlil. Our guide was so lovely, he spoke very good English which he said he'd had to take himself off to Marrakech to learn. The first part of the walk was quite steep and it had been a while since I had done anything like it, but we were allowed to go at our own pace, our guide was very patient and even carried my handbag to alleviate the drag from me! It was a really memorable day and we talked about many things to do with his village, housing, Marrakech amongst others. The waterfalls he took us to see were spectacular and I conquered my fear of heights somewhat climbing up to his village. On the way back down we were treated to a superb chicken tagine with vegetables and bread along with water and mint tea, followed by fruit. An amazing day, which I couldn't recommend enough.",September 2018,Toubkal Guide,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d2141452-Reviews-Toubkal_Guide-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",attractions,5.0,5.0
5 Star? Needs to do Better!,"Agadir was the second leg of our Morocco trip after Marrakech and I had specifically booked this hotel for some R & R after what I thought would be a fairly frenetic Marrakech! It didn't start well, we were shown to some seating in reception and given a drink and some biscuits. After a little while, a receptionist came over and asked for my credit card which she swiped to cover forthcoming charges - one of those transactions that doesn't go through, it's a just in case, even so I thought over £300 for a 4-night stay was excessive! After that we waited some more, and waited ........and waited! After some forty minutes my husband flagged down a passing manager and asked what the delay was / was anyone going to communicate with us. The same receptionist reappeared and apologised because our room wasn't ready and wouldn't be for another forty minutes or so - more than an hour after agreed check-in. After we complained about the lack of communication she took us on a tour of the hotel and when we returned, the manager we had spoken to advised that we had been upgraded to a suite! This was obviously a very nice token and we thanked him appropriately, another manager took us to our suite and it was mostly great but the fridge which should have held the minibar was completely empty! She went away stating she'd ensure that it was filled even though we'd said not to worry, but it never was anyway the entire time! Breakfast the next day was enjoyable with a vast choice and being able to sit on the terrace and look out at the sea was very relaxing. We decided to enjoy the sun around the pool and at lunchtime after waiting some time for a pool waiter to come over, ordered a burger and club sandwich - what a rip-off!! Very expensive with little content, my sandwich wasn't bad but for the price was rather less than I expected and my husband's burger consisted only of the burger, the bun, and some odd-looking relish!! During the day was then much the same for all the days to follow, except we made the effort to go to the Oasis bar next to the hotel on the beach for twice the food at half the price! There was nothing to do at the hotel at all, and the background music was dreary! We were only staying bed and breakfast and having discounted the evening menus as anything worth having at the hotel we trekked the promenade in search of restaurants - it was a very long walk as we were at least a mile from anything at the very end of the promenade but it was better than staying put.
Every day we had to phone to ask for water as this never got refilled automatically. We were left fruit but only on the first day. One day I had to phone to ask for hot water as I had tried to run a bath and it was cold!
Overall, four days was more than enough and we were glad to move on. For a five star hotel they need to try an awful lot harder!",September 2018,Hôtel Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293731-d2573287-Reviews-Hotel_Sofitel_Agadir_Thalassa_Sea_Spa-Agadir_Souss_Massa.html,"Agadir, Morocco",hotels,3.0,4.5
"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!!!!","Lovely people, lovely building, lovely food, lovely hammam and spa....fab, fab, fab!! This Riad so deserves it's five score, if there was six I would award that! We were met at the airport by the hotel's driver - what a treat after being submitted to Morocco's 2-hour immigration debacle, absolute disgrace. Following obviously well made plans we were taken to the edge of the Medina which is as far as vehicle transport was allowed, then led to the hotel by 2 really nice boys with our cases in a kind of wheelbarrow! We were warmly greeted by Asma and offered mint tea, really nice just a little too sweet for our liking! We were then shown around the hotel, and finally to our bedroom which was outstanding. Wonderful decoration, great en-suite and usable toiletries, by which I mean we had pump-operated bottles of shampoo and shower gel rather than those silly teeny-tiny bottles which next to nothing comes out of! These bottles were even refilled whilst we were there to ensure the contents did not run out and towels were changed during the day if you'd had an extra shower, plus the bed being was turned down in the evening. We also had slippers and bath robes which I took advantage of when going to the spa and lazing around! On day 2 Maria took us through the map of Marrakech and provided us with a phone to call the hotel if we got lost - which we did!! You just had to describe where you were and they sent someone to come and find you, the only slight difficulty with this is all the lanes in the Medina look the same and aren't named, so one ochre building looked much the same as the next - come on government help the hotels a bit, at least name the streets! Later on day 2 we met Sara whom I had been communicating with via email and had booked our trips for us during our stay in Marrakech. Another lovely lady who like all the staff couldn't do enough to help.
We had one relaxing day in the hotel and I had my hammam and massage which was a delight. We ended the day with our specially cooked Moroccan meal which was amazing, each course was outstanding, and the chocolate pudding was to die for!
The following day we decided after a bit of an altercation with a street kid that we were happy to eat in the hotel rather than run the gauntlet of the Medina again. We weren't so hungry so decided on a pizza and caesar salad to share. Again, food heaven.
We visited the Atlas Mountains during our stay and as I said previously, this was one of the trips organised for us by Sara. We were escorted to our driver outside the Medina who drove us for the day and stopped at various places for photo calls! We were met by a lovely guy who escorted us up the mountains to view the wonderful waterfalls and then onto his village, before coming back down with us to a restaurant where we were served chicken tagine with vegetables and bread along with mint tea and water, followed by fruit, which tasted wonderful and was devoured quickly after our long walk! Lastly returning with us to our walking start point before being driven back to Marrakech.
This hotel really is a serene oasis which you could easily come to for a long weekend and not leave until it was time to go home! Amazing friendly people, beautiful surroundings, and wasting time on the rooftop listening to the birds and call to prayer in the sunshine or warm evenings could not be more enjoyable.",September 2018,Riad Kheirredine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293734-d1873436-Reviews-Riad_Kheirredine-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",hotels,5.0,5.0
Amazingly High!,"My husband was astounded when I suggested we had a go on this wheel as I am scared of heights, but I was determined to try - keep doing things to conquer the fear! I did get a bit nervous but mainly OK, as long as I looked outwards and not downwards! It went on for longer than expected to - we went round several times which was a surprise and made it good value for money.",September 2018,La Grande Roue Agadir,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293731-d8870218-Reviews-La_Grande_Roue_Agadir-Agadir_Souss_Massa.html,"Agadir, Morocco",attractions,4.0,4.0
"Wide Flat Place to Walk, but No Bikes Allowed!",This was a very long walk from our hotel - Sofitel Agadir Thalassa Sea & Spa to anything going on as it was at the very end of the promenade.

Sunset on the Beach,"This was really enjoyable, the camels were really friendly and behaved, even when mine became untied from the one in front s/he still carried on walking in line!

Nice Place!,"Rooms were really good with extra large comfy beds, bathrooms were more than reasonable with nice washing gels. Only downside to the room was the heat, it was incredibly hot and although a fan had been provided this did little to change the room temperature. The pub itself was lovely, and the food was outstanding - you need to try the Butcher's Block, amazing!

Definitely NOT 5 Star!,"I'm not a big Tripadvisor contributor so when I do ""put pen to paper"" it's because there's really something to say, and I hope it's useful.
I got asked by a member of staff here if there is anything they could do better, I think she took my hesitance as meaning nothing exceptional, but here's the list:
Food - far too repetitive, what came out at lunchtime often returned in the evening and/or the following day! More variety is required, and more food suitable for young children.
Toilets - more needed closer to the pools, a long walk is currently required either up or downstairs of which there are loads. Goodness only knows how families with buggies get on. The alternative is therefore........!
Umbrellas- required for shade during the day at the pool bar, people could actually sit there then.
No Smoking Areas - I know we've been spoilt in the UK, but seriously, the amount of people that light up the second they've swallowed their last mouthful is disgusting. Non-smoking areas need to be installed around the pools, the amphitheatre, the pool bar - which is where everyone sits in the evening, and more of the restaurant. Quite apart from not having to constantly breathe in this poison, as a non-smoker it might actually mean I don't have to sit amongst the ashtrays and fag butts that haven't been cleared from around the pools the following day.
Reception - needs brightening up, far too gloomy.
Reception Staff - need more that speak English, UK clientele are accepted, we should be catered for.
Entertainment - contrary to popular opinion on here, I don't think the Animation Team work all that hard barring the mini club team perhaps. There's certainly nothing for older children/teenagers at any point during the day. In Cyprus last year, the adult water volleyball game was followed by a teenagers one for example. The evening entertainment should be on a 2-weekly rota so you get to see something different during your holiday, instead of the same the 2nd week.
Standing on a balcony looking out over the gardens and pool to the sea is beautiful, but this is the only real positive I can give, closer inspection spoils the view.",July 2015,Fantasia Hotel De Luxe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297972-d454926-Reviews-Fantasia_Hotel_De_Luxe-Kusadasi_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Kusadasi, Turkey",hotels,3.0,4.5
What a Let Down!,"This was our third visit to The Walnut Tree as we are regularly in the area because we own a Church Farm caravan. However it will be our last. We visited at lunchtime on Sunday 31 August and sat outside as the weather was pleasant and we had our Labrador with us. Having waited for over thirty minutes for our food, and noted that tables with higher order numbers than us were getting their food first, I went back to the order counter to query the whereabouts of our order. The proprietor checked in the kitchen and advised that our meal was on the hotplate at that moment and would therefore be out imminently. At which point he stated ""You may have noticed we are quite busy!"" My family received their meals correctly, but I ordered the roast beef which is supposed to come with a bowl of vegetables, after ten minutes it became apparent the waitress was not returning with my missing veg, so I had to go back again and ask for it! Having waited so long for the food, it would have been nice for it to have at least been hot, clearly this was also too much to ask! The Walnut Tree is considerably more expensive than other pubs serving food in the area, but we have previously gone for a treat, as the surroundings are nice and we'd had good food. Next time we'll save our money!",August 2014,The Walnut Tree,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186406-d1127456-Reviews-The_Walnut_Tree-Chichester_West_Sussex_England.html,"Chichester, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Lovely Time!,"We have just returned from a lovely two weeks at the Kefalos, 2 adults, and 2 boys 15 and 12. We had a 1 bedroom apartment which was clean and functional, nothing outstanding but therefore nothing too posh to worry about the kids breaking something! The pool was lovely and plenty big enough to not be overcrowded. The whole place certainly had a village feeling with low rise buildings and crazy paving paths, really nice. We had bed and breakfast, and there was certainly plenty of food to go round although after a week got a bit sameish. Most of the hotel staff were friendly although there were a couple of examples of miserable people! Most credit has to go to the Animation Team who provided both adult and children's entertainment during the day and evening. They worked extremely hard and really made the holiday. Congrats and thanks to Rico, Bob, Ramona, Taylor, and Tanya.",August 2014,Kefalos Beach Tourist Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190384-d292550-Reviews-Kefalos_Beach_Tourist_Village-Paphos_Paphos_District.html,"Paphos, Cyprus",hotels,4.0,4.5
Excellent All Round!,"Have just had a wonderful meal at the Poseidonas. We sat in the upstairs part of the restaurant in order to get a full view of the harbour, and it was clean, airy and well laid out. We were mainly served by Angela who was courteous and attentive. The food was served at a good pace as were the drinks, we didn't just get one then get forgotten, we were given the opportunity to order agin. The food was all well presented, really tasty, and more than enough to go round! Would definitely recommend and hope to go back before our holiday is over.",August 2014,The Poseidonas Cafe - Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190384-d1136898-Reviews-The_Poseidonas_Cafe_Restaurant-Paphos_Paphos_District.html,"Paphos, Cyprus",restaurants,5.0,3.0
