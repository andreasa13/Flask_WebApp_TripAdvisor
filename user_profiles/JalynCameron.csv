Great view,Really good view. The food was just okay and over priced. The service was good but was close to feeling a bit long.,July 2020,Hula Grill Waikiki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60982-d548001-Reviews-Hula_Grill_Waikiki-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",restaurants,4.0,4.5
ELOTE,Great place to grab a bite to eat that is delicious and will make you satisfied. The elots corn is the highlight. Super tasty! Pricey side but as to be expected.

Great,Friendly staff! Quick service. Take out took avout 7 mins. They have great combo deals!

Super delicious,"Had a wonderful dinner here. The carrot spread they serve with their bread was surprisingly a highlight. We enjoyed their French onion soup, beef wellington, and sirloin. Very good experience!",April 2020,Mon Ami Gabi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d422629-Reviews-Mon_Ami_Gabi-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Dirty sheets and linen,"This hotel is located in the middle of the strip! Great location! Long checkin line and process. We specifically booked online to have mini fridge brought up as we needed it for mediciation. It wasn't ready when we arrived. Took more than 1 hour for it to arrive to our room. We couldn't leave the hotel until we put the meds away.

We went with 3 people in two separate rooms. Our room had stains all over the bedding. Our friends room had a random pillow sitting on the floor without a pillow case. The other pillows on the bed also didn't have any cases. We called to get these problems fixed and again had to wait about another hour. The cleaner who came brought only what she needed and when she put on the new sheet, the ""new"" sheet had another huge stain on the it. She had to leave and come back again adding to more time wasted. Overall it was not worth what we paid. Wont be coming back. Pay the same about of money and stay at Ballys or TI. Way better experiences there.",April 2020,Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d114889-Reviews-Harrah_s_Las_Vegas_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,3.0,4.0
Location!,Its perfectly located right on the Strip! Right beside a CVS and the Grand Bazzar. Everything is walking distance. We accidently booked a w/c accessible room not realizing and upon arrival we confirm we didnt need that style of room and they offered an upgraded to a fountain view for only 5 dollars and waived our early check in fee. Very open concept room. Lots of space for your stuff. Clean and friendly staff. Easy check in and out process. The room had a mini fridge. The casino is a bit dated compared to others on the strip but the prices are always cheaper and its all about location!!,February 2020,Bally's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d121312-Reviews-Bally_s_Las_Vegas_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,5.0,4.0
Arrive early,"One of the MUST dos in London at least once, this place was a joy to explore. We took about 4 hours to feel like we explored enough of the grounds about 85%. We really enjoyed the crown jewels. Truly breathtaking. Tip, arrive before opening to get in line. If you have an e ticket purchased through trip advisor or Get your Guide for example, you'll still need to line up in a separate line to obtain a physical ticket.They don't inform you until you're at the gate so beware. We waited in 3 separate lines before we finally got in to the right one with the right form of ticket. More signage could really avoid this. No photos of the crown jewels allowed but you can stay as long as you like. Again another pro tip, go straight to the crown jewels upon entering as a separate line will form quickly for that building alone.",October 2019,Tower of London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187547-Reviews-Tower_of_London-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Worth a walk,A very nice place for a stroll to walk and people watch. It's filled with businesses and restaurants and bustles with activity.

Pretty good,"Really great experience. Small area and tables which is understandable for this location. We had to wait about 20 mins on a Sunday night. The service was polite and prompt. Highlight were the truffle edamame. Prices were around average and up. As for the ramen, I would say about 8.5/10.",October 2019,Kanada-Ya - Panton Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d10168606-Reviews-Kanada_Ya_Panton_Street-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
So convenient but small cars,Really easy to use and understand. Everything is clearly labeled. For the most part all the platforms and trains were clean during our 3 day stay. Only complaint are the heights of the cars. If you're tall. You'll most likely have to tilt you head if yiu stand to the side.,October 2019,London Underground,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187536-Reviews-London_Underground-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
What you expect,Very grand. Very toruristy. So expect crowds. There's a nice park beside the Palace that is alot quieter and less crowded. There's a beautiful monument for lost Canadian Troops. The Big Bus stop is beside and across the street from the Palace. There are not many foos options in this area so plan your meals accordingly.,October 2019,Buckingham Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187549-Reviews-Buckingham_Palace-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5
Yes! Do It,"So Worth it! We loved using the big bus as part of the Paris Pass!

We bought big bus tickets for Paris and London. Our London experience wasnt the best- the busses came way less often (around 20 min wait each time), the busses were always full so standing room only (cant listen to historical info) and when you do get a seat, the ear phone jacks dont work.

But in Paris, we completely utilized every aspect of the busses and tour routes!! None of the earphone jacks had issues and the busses came very frequently. No more than a 7 min wait throughout our 3 days in Paris. We always got seats!

It was so perfect t to just check off all the landmarks so effortlessly and enjoy the historical info as we drive under the Eiffel Tower! So worth it. Saved our feet!",October 2019,Big Bus Paris,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d1008070-Reviews-Big_Bus_Paris-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.0
Do it once and only once.,"Super over priced and toruristy. But also a must do in Versailles. It's definitely a day trip from Paris to Versailles. The train ride is relatively easy. The admission is pricey but included in the Paris Pass (but no transport). Pro tip, do the Gardens first if you arrive in the afternoon and the palace first if you arrive in the morning. Also rent a cart while at the gardens if you want to cover more ground quickly. The gravel makes it difficult to walk for long periods. The gardens are massive and by foot will take about 1.5 hours. They offer diffenet lengths of routes on the map. There is also a quick service restaurant within the gardens. Palace was so fast paced and super crowded. Didn't feel like we could really rest and enjoy all the rooms without being rushed along. Also most of the rooms where closed when we went so the palace only took about 45 minutes to complete. The lady at the ticket box was very rude. The line for tickets alao very long.",October 2019,Palace of Versailles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187148-d188681-Reviews-Palace_of_Versailles-Versailles_Yvelines_Ile_de_France.html,"Versailles, France",attractions,3.0,4.0
Wow,"Hard to put this place into words. Its just magnificent. Its so grand and just beyond anything we could have imagined. We went late in the evening. From 6pm to closing 1045pm. We managed to see everything we wanted including the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo and so much more. Being able to see the inners of the original castle the Louvre was built around to the infamous inverse pyramid, it was all breathtaking.",October 2019,Louvre Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188757-Reviews-Louvre_Museum-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Yes!,We entered using the Paris Pass. Be sure to cross the intersection underneath the road. The signs are clearly labeled. There was no line and they funnel you very quickly towards the staircase. There is a free elevator that they don't advertise. Kindly ask one of the attendants and you'll have to wait on he side for the next lift up. I almost started going up the stairs as they funnel you super quickly but managed to get into the elevator. Very friendly service. Elevator is large enough for 5-7 people. There are a few more steps up after you exit the elevator FYI. View is Spectacular but there are metal bars that block alot of pics.,October 2019,Arc de Triomphe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188709-Reviews-Arc_de_Triomphe-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wonderful Experience,We used the Paris Pass to enter. The big bus stop is right outside the museum. The museum was grand and mostly everything we could hope for. When we went sadly 2 floors were closed to the public so we only spent about 2 hours here. The Van Gogh section was worth it! They was a restaurant on site. Recommend heading straight to the back and take the elevator up to the top floor and work your way down.,October 2019,Musée d'Orsay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188150-Reviews-Musee_d_Orsay-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,4.0,4.5

Worth the wait,"There's a reason this place always has a line up. Featured on many food tours, videos, foodies and more this place doesn't disappoint. Such fresh flavors, made to order, super affordable and filling. We could eat this literally everyday. Perfect amount of seasoning.

Nice for relaxing afternoon snack,Wonderful outside seating area across from the restaurant. They make fresh bougatsa throughout the day. If you come during the day you can watch them make it fresh. We had the meat bougatsa and the regular. Great snack after a day of sightseeing.,October 2019,Bougatsadiko Thessaloniki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d8784231-Reviews-Bougatsadiko_Thessaloniki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Came back for seconds,This place doesnt disappoint! Only wish there were more locations!!! They have a lovely selection of combinations. We would highly recommend the bougatsa stuffed lukumades covered with white chocolate. This was the suggestion of the worker as the best seller. Everything made to order fresh. I know lots of people also like the traditional honey combo. We came here twice because we just couldn't leave Athens without a second taste.

Very big !!!,"Its great if you're interested in modern/contemporary art. It's quite the massive centre so it may take you a few visits to see it all.

A Must Do,"We purchased our tickets at the gate. It was the all attraction pass to the other attractions within the next 2 days. We utilized that ticket for ALL of our site seeing needs in Athens. The Acropolis was as expected, breathtaking. Come early to avoid the crowds as it fills up quickly. Sefie sticks are allowed. Its a slow incline for those worried about the steps. Lots of side areas to rest along the way. Its easy to moderate. There are also two entrances you can enter in from FYI.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very nice view,"Really nice view walking around the fully marble stadium. Entey fee is a bit pricey since you can basically see the entire stadium from the outside. But you also gain access to a mini museum of the stadium underground.

Loved it,"Highly recommend this place for affordable prices for yummy greek dishes. The service was great, atmosphere lovely, ambience superb, food sublime.

Worth it,Wow! What a spectacular experience! Every aspect will take your breath away. They have free guided tours every few hours. We arrived right on time for their next free tour. The lovely gentleman who talked for about 1.5 hours was super informative and helpful. He paced everything out so well and took us to many hidden areas of the cathedral. He has worked with the church for almost 50 years and knows his stuff! Loved that its free. We also climbed to the very top. Its a narrow trek.

"Go if you like Sherlock, don't if you're partial.","Really nice staff, really cool knick knacks all throughout the mussuem. Cool gadgets and trinkets to get from the gift shop.

"Great Museum, Rude Staff","We had such a good time at this Museum. The highlight was the Rosetta Stone but this massive museum is filled with millions of things to see. You could spend weeks browsing around. The entry is free or with a donation. There was no line to get into the museum at 4pm. They have a cloak room for an extra charge.

There are a few dining options within the museum, including a grab and go coffee shop.

As the museum was closing we heard an announcement that we had 15 mins before closing time. We started to head back to the main entrance and was met by a VERY rude worker who SHOVED us out of one of the show rooms. I just couldn't believe how aggressive he was and rude to us. Had no idea why he had to literally PUSH us out as we still had 15 mins plus we were clearly walking in the direction of the exit.",October 2019,The British Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187555-Reviews-The_British_Museum-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
