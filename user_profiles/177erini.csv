Live entertainment,We enjoyed the live band that was playing during dinner.

THE BEST,Wow.. everything on this menu looked amazing. It was hard to pick a dish. The Mahi tacos were the best I’ve had. There was a large variety to choose from and a lot of specials on the menu. Their mimosa and sangria menu has quite the variety as well. We were so bummed that we found this place on our last night and weren’t able to try their brunch.,May 2019,Moondog Cafe & Bakery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34345-d15196938-Reviews-Moondog_Cafe_Bakery-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida.html,"Key West, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Nice location,"We enjoyed staying within walking distance to everything we needed yet still being in a quiet relaxing environment.

Worth the wait?,"When we went to check out the Southernmost Point the lines were probably about an hour long.. there were people skipping line and trying to take pictures around the marker.

Backcountry kayak and snorkel tour,"Our crew of James, Pax, and Harley made the trip awesome! We enjoyed their company and hospitality.

"Traditional, but not for us","My husband and I ate here from a recommendation we received from our hotel. We like to try new things, so we were open to the traditional Ligurian cuisine. We were sat outside which has a nice view of the town. Then we waited about 20 mins and no waitress ever came. By then we had looked at the menu for too long and didn’t want anything on the menu but felt rude leaving. The food was good, but not something we’d like to eat again.",September 2018,La Loggia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580223-d1807473-Reviews-La_Loggia-Levanto_Italian_Riviera_Liguria.html,"Levanto, Italy",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Best appetizers,"My husband and I stopped in here after dinner because it was the only place he could find a local IPA. The service was great, they brought us appetizers and my husband had a few beers while I had aperol spritzers. We sat outside, but the inside had a game room with a pool table.

"Great food, great prices","In Levanto it was hard to find a restaurant with anything other than fish and seafood dishes on the menu.

Great place to stay!,"We stayed in Levanto for the 3 nights we had in cinque terre. The hotel is on top of a hill but provides free shuttle to and from town and the train station. We enjoyed staying in Levanto and taking the train to the more tourist places like monterosso. The hotel was very friendly, clean, had good breakfast selection and a nice pool.",September 2018,Park Hotel Argento,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580223-d1554785-Reviews-Park_Hotel_Argento-Levanto_Italian_Riviera_Liguria.html,"Levanto, Italy",hotels,5.0,5.0
Highlight of our trip,"My husband and I spent 2 weeks in Greece and Italy for hour honeymoon. I’m cinque terre we had a private tour guide named Pall from Viator who spent the day showing us around, hiking trails, telling us about the culture, history, and individual people he’s met. He let us know about a local beef and ravioli festival going on in a village on the mountain and spent the night drinking homemade wine and eating with us! It was the highlight of our trip.",September 2018,Cinque Terre Trails,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187817-d2304645-Reviews-Cinque_Terre_Trails-Cinque_Terre_Italian_Riviera_Liguria.html,"Cinque Terre, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Quick stop, large menu",We stopped in for lunch on the way back to our hotel. There is a large menu of every kind of spaghetti and pizza you could imagine.

"Pasta, wine, and limoncello!",We visited for dinner after a recommendation from friends. The restaurant was able to get us in without a reservation but I would recommend one just in case. The atmosphere is quiet compared to the busy streets of Rome. Everything we ordered was delicious. I explained to the waiter what kind of wine I typically enjoyed and out of their huge selection he pulled one that was perfect. The service was great and the food was the best we’ve had so far. It is within walking distance from the Spanish steps and definitely shouldn’t be missed!,September 2018,Il Gabriello,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1066539-Reviews-Il_Gabriello-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Worst experience in Athens,"I booked Dinner in the Sky as our special dinner for celebrating our honeymoon as our last night in Athens. We arrived, were greeted with welcome cocktails, and were so excited for the experience. (We planned our whole day around it.) We were told to lock our belongings up and get in line to board. We filled out our waiver and our passes were taken. Nothing was said to us.. then as we were waiting in line to go on we were told we couldn’t go on because we booked through Expedia (reputable website? Yes) and our reservation hadn’t been received. We then were *promised* by the gentleman that boards guests that he would find a way to get us on. In hindsight it was because there were 2 people who were late. He also whispered to us that there was another group of 6 whose reservation was lost but they would apparently take us on instead of them, and that also if the couple that was late booked through Expedia, they would take us instead. As a business that is so unprofessional. They then had us wait on the side while everyone else was strapped in, at this point we had wasted over 2 hours of our time getting there and standing there. Of course, the last two people showed up late, and were let on. The gentleman who *promised* we would get on disappeared and the man who stated he was the owner came to speak with us. He was rude, and short with us when we tried to explain we had spent so much time, not to mention spending a ridiculous amount for a cab, and pretty much wasted our last night in Athens. At this point I was crying because this was supposed to be the highlight dinner of our honeymoon. The owner didn’t seem to care, after all the dinner was full so he wasn’t missing out on any money. As a business owner, I understand that while it may not have been his fault that our reservation was lost (even though somehow our names were on their list and that we had booked through Expedia) it is your job to do everything you can to accommodate the customer. I left feeling like it was a slap in the face. I can’t comment on the experience or the food because we didn’t get to experience it, but based on the experience we did have I would never recommend this place to anyone, I’d highly recommend against it. The owner threw 25 euros to us for our cab ride there.. great.. and then we had to spent an additional 40 euros for a cab ride back to our hotel. At this point it was almost 9 and every restaurant we went to was so crowded that we had to pick up a gyro from a walk up place. Great last dinner in Athens.",August 2018,Dinner in the Sky,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7825999-Reviews-Dinner_in_the_Sky-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,5.0
Absolutely wonderful,"We stayed at Absolute Bliss for 3 nights during our honeymoon in Santorini. From the moment we arrived the staff (manager Sofia) welcomed us with a smile, drinks, and snacks while our room was getting ready. The view is spectacular, in my opinion the best sunset view we had in Santorini. Every single staff member is extremely nice and accommodating. Everything is also very clean and organized. The room service and drinks are very reasonably priced and the service was great. Breakfast was delivered to our balcony every morning as well, and there are many options to choose from. Sofia made a reservation for us at the wine bar, and due to a restaurant having a similar name, we didn’t realize until a couple hours before that it wasn’t at the restaurant we wanted. It wasn’t anyone’s fault; the names were the same. When the wine bar we wanted couldn’t fit us in, Sofia went above and beyond to find a solution. She offered to have us order from a local restaurant and have it delivered to our balcony so we could have dinner at sunset on our balcony since it was our last night. She then personally came up to our room, brought tons of pretty candles and lights, and had our dinner delivered right at sunset. She also gave us a bottle of local wine to enjoy with dinner. The hotel is beautiful and worth it in itself, but out of all the traveling I have done the staff here has been the BEST! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a romantic get away in Santorini. We will most definitely be back!",September 2018,Absolute Bliss Imerovigli Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d1111004-Reviews-Absolute_Bliss_Imerovigli_Suites-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
So good!,"This restaurant was recommended to us by a couple at the pool. They said they had eaten there 3 times during their stay because it was that good! We decided to try it for our last dinner in Santorini, and we were not disappointed. We had a few appetizers and entrees and everything exceeded our expectations.

Amazing!,"We booked the sunset cruise through a recommendation from a friend. We were picked up by Dmitrius who was happy, friendly, and an awesome driver. (The streets of Santorini are a bit difficult to drive with all the ATVs cruising around.) we were greeted by the crew, with Lianna leading the way. Everything about the cruise was perfect. There were about 8 couples on board, and a small child. The crew was accommodating to dietary concerns from the beginning. As we cruised around our drinks were kept full and the crew constantly made sure everyone was happy. The dinner Lianna prepared was mouth watering. Greek salads, pasta, fish, chicken, everything was delicious. As the sunset crept up as we got close to Oia, Lianna began to sing and play the guitar. Her voice was truly the voice of an angel! It made the end of the experience unforgettable. I would highly recommend this excursion to anyone, but if you can get Lianna and her crew you are in for a treat!",September 2018,Spiridakos Sailing Cruises,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482942-d1810127-Reviews-Spiridakos_Sailing_Cruises-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Worth the money,"We decided to find a beach in Athens for a day to take a break from sightseeing. After looking a bit around I decided to spend the 30 euro per person for a beach chair for the day at Astir beach. It was totally worth it! The facilities were clean, and the beach was beautiful.

Have to see it,"We decided to visit Acropolis without a guided tour and I’m glad we did. We waited in line for about an hour, which was actually quicker than I expected as it was a busy afternoon.

If you are interested in details about the history I’d recommend a tour, but we were satisfied exploring on our own.",August 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
