Wonderful Rooftop with Great Service hidden from Indiscreet Eyes,"I found this place whilst strolling around town, a few blocks away from the popular streets and the church. The restaurant is located within a cozy hotel, hidden from indiscreet eyes (as there is no sign). The design was the first thing that caught my attention.

The restaurant located on the rooftop, offer views of the church and has a glass roof as well (great for the windy evening that you may encounter during the winter months).

The service was excellent and so was the food. I just went for dessert, and it was delicious. Whilst reading the menu I decided that I will have to return during my next visit to San Miguel de Allende.

Fantastic Tour and Overview of Athens. Thanks Maria Elena!,"I took the tour in Spanish with Maria Elena, and she was the best guide. She made the tour very interesting, to the point and including many stories of the Greek mythology. It is great to get on a tour learn the history of the city, country you are but that you do not feel like you are in a history class, and Maria Elena did exactly that.

Get ready to walk quite a few Kms, thus I'd suggest you do the morning or the evening tour, but you won't feel it.

The tour is fantastic to get an excellent overview of Athens, thus try to do it on your first day. From then you can plan the rest of your time in the Greek capital.

Exquisite Cuisine & Breathtaking Views,"Hands down for one of the best dining experience I had in Ticino.

The first impression of the place was its view - wow - a million dollar view of the lake and the mountains.
We were greeted immediately by Cristian, in a friendly and genuine manner. He accommodated us on the terrace; we just couldn't stop talking about how amazing the view was.

We started our dinner with a nice aperol for aperitivo. Then we got served some local sparkling one; it was excellent. Glad we asked for a recommendation for our second drink.

The menu is very well curated, with many regional ingredients fused with international flavours. Everything look delicious, thus we went for the tasting menu. Every single dish from the amuse-bouche to the dessert were superb. All dishes were like pieces of art (yes we had to take pictures of each dish) and had a freshly fantastic taste.

The attention of our server was excellent, we never had to ask to refill our glasses. Every details was taken well care of.

We had the moscato granita for dessert which was very refreshing. Wish I could have that recipe. After dessert we were surprised with another excellent dessert, as I casually mentioned it was our anniversary.

They made every so easy for us; we were greeted within the terminal (we did request a special service they offer that helps skip the queue at immigration and customs - that's truly first class service, totally worth it). Our greeter and driver were friendly and vast knowledge of the destination; which made us book a private tour with them to explore more of the Baja.

A FLAWLESS Experience,"Not trying to exaggerate, but Rosewood Mayakoba was the best resort experience I have ever had. It could not have get any better, not even if I've dreamed about it.
I could write a novel praising how fantastic the resort is, but with limit my review in the major highlights to make it easier for you to read.

The arrival experience is something truly unique. Do not want to give any spoilers, but it's magical.

The rooms are wonderful, nicely and elegantly appointed, spacious, private pool and a daybed on the roof. Extremely private and peaceful. You can have a golf cart picking you up but I preferred to ask for a bike and tour the beautiful property at my own pace.

All the restaurants have delicious food, very well presented (I ended up taking pictures of pretty much all dishes). Excellent service. Punta Bonita was my favourite for lunch - I was surprised with an order of churros (without cinnamon, due to my intolerance - a true wow factor). I will have to go back as I didn't get to experience 'Aqui me Quedo'.

The beach is stunning. The sand seems flour. The amenities and service were outstanding.

Breakfast at Casa del Lago was great - really loved the buffet set up and the a la carte options.

The spa was one of the largest I've ever seen. The wet areas were a true blessing, you can make use of them even though you do not have a scheduled treatment. The fitness centre (which is open 24/7) is great, there are fantastic group fitness classes. Giovanni the personal trainer is a true superstar, I had the best TRX training.
