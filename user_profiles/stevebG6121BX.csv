Excellent Afternoon Tea In a lovely environment and outstanding service.,"Despite London having moved into the new Tier 2 (High) Covid-19 category, my wife and myself had Afternoon Tea earlier today in the Park Room at the Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane.

We arrived a little late but were given a warm welcome by both Andre and Herlyn who were not only expecting us (current bookings are understandably much lower than normal) but provided exceptional service throughout our visit. With only one other table taken, we were soon sitting at one of the nice window tables overlooking Hyde Park.

After taking our Tea (we both opted for English Breakfast) and Jam (Ginger & Rhubarb, Rose Petal and Strawberry) orders, it wasn’t long before our substantial Afternoon Tea (good range of delicious sandwiches, 4 lovely scones and some nice deserts) arrived. There was certainly plenty to eat and what was left was put into a doggy bag together with 2 slices of lemon drizzle cake.

Not only that, we had two pots of Ginger & Lemon Tea before departing by which time it was pleasing to see several other tables having been taken.

All in all, it was a most enjoyable experience - enhanced by both Andre & Herlyn who certainly went the extra mile as far as we were concerned!",October 2020,The Park Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1017662-Reviews-The_Park_Room-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Visit here first before parting with your hard-earned money!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Athens and when we asked where the best place to shop was the answer was Ermou Street.

As it happens, we weren’t overly impressed with Ermou Street (like much of Athens today it is full of graffiti and many empty premises) and found the Flea Market (entrance is at Monastiraki Square) much more to a liking. As such - and be on your guard for potential pickpockets - this would be my recommended option for newcomers to Athens.",October 2020,Flea Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1574024-d6429024-Reviews-Flea_Market-Monastiraki_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Monastiraki, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.5
Most Enjoyable Stay;,"My wife and myself are coming to the end of a 4 night stay at the Grand Hyatt Athens (known by some of the taxi-drivers as the old Marriott) located in the centre of the busy Syngrou Avenue - not that this (nor the ongoing construction work at the adjacent building) presented any noise issues during our stay.

The location may put some people off but it is only a 5 Euros taxi fare to Syntagna Square and - for the more energetic - a 30/40 minute walk to the Acropolis. On the plus side, the 8th floor outside swimming pool (with great Acropolis views) was clearly a very popular facility!

We were very happy with our room/suite - equally comfortable & spacious with a lovely bed and separate bath and rain shower/wet area (equipped with quality toiletries). Similarly, and unlike a number of recent reviewers, we were more than happy with the Breakfast offering - particularly, with the ongoing COVID-19 limitations (an area in which the property score highly) - although my strong recommendation is to dine early as it does get very busy from 0900 hours onwards!

The Hotel’s greatest asset, however, is its staff. They are unfailing pleasant and helpful - nothing was ever too much trouble and were most grateful to the outstanding service provided by both the F & B team at Breakfast and all the members of the Reception Staff. Indeed, managing to secure a late checkout was a big plus in planning our final day.

All in all, a most enjoyable stay - one we would have no difficulty repeating in the future.",October 2020,Grand Hyatt Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15009871-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
One of Athens’ many Hidden Gems!,"On our last morning in Athens, my wife and myself came across the delightful Vrisakiou Cafe/Restaurant shortly after having visited the Roman Agora.

It is located in an old house and everything is very tastefully done. We had drinks in a delightful balcony area on the second floor. Service was excellent - as were the drinks (freshly-squeezed Orange Juice & Cappuccino) - and in many ways we were fortunate to have found a free table.

Somewhere well worth visiting again the next time we find ourselves in Athens!!",October 2020,Vryssaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4884773-Reviews-Vryssaki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Not high on the priority list but well worth a short visit!,"On our last day in Athens, my wife and myself had a stroll around the main sights and - particularly, as this is one of the 7 attractions covered by the Combined Ticket - we had a quick look around the Roman Agora (short distance from its better known counterpart the Ancient Agora).

It was well worth doing so as - besides 2 other visitors - we had the place to ourselves!",October 2020,Roman Agora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242841-Reviews-Roman_Agora-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
"Oldest, Largest & Most Popular of the Six Monasteries.","Great Meteoran was the third of the 3 Monasteries that my wife and myself visited during our recent visit to Meteora.

It also happened to be both the oldest and largest one and - as such - attracted far more interest than the other two (St Stephen’s & Holy Trinity) we visited. It is less arduous to access than Holy Trinity (which was my personal favourite - due largely to the physical location) but each Monastry has its own appeal. Of particular interest here was the old kitchen which was amazing to see and I do wonder when this stopped operation?

All in all, the Great Meteoron proved a fitting way to end an unforgettable visit!",October 2020,Great Meteoron Monastery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315843-d243300-Reviews-Great_Meteoron_Monastery-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Just gets better and better!,"As my previous Reviews of this property make clear, this has become my ‘home away from home’ during regular visits to Bangkok over the past 7 years and whilst many Hotels open on a high and then decline the Athenee has bucked the trend by going from strength to strength!

As such, the recent acquisition of ‘Luxury Collection’ status is the latest tangible development. It has brought with it enhanced service levels (attractive new uniforms), additional quality in room amenities (ie in addition to the comprehensive refurbishment programme only completed some 6-9 months ago), improved F & B (Buffet Breakfasts are outstanding with many new features including an excellent Juice Bar and both the choice and quality of Afternoon Tea and Evening offerings in the Royal Club Executive Lounge have improved considerably) and first rate leisure (Gymn, Pool, Spa & Walking) facilities.

In addition, both the access and location of the property remain huge pluses in a bustling City such as Bangkok. The Ploenchit TBS Station is a comfortable 5 minute walk away and both the famous Central Embassy & Chitlom (as well as Amarin Plaza) Retail outlets are all within striking distance. My own favourite, however, is Lumpini Park (see separate Review) which is 15 minutes walk away down Wireless Road and the home to some interesting wildlife - including many large Monitor Lizards!

All in all, however, the property just gets better and better and - perhaps helped by the fact that I’m one of the regulars - I’m always impressed by just how many of the staff not only know my name but are always prepared to go the extra mile!",January 2018,"The Athenee Hotel, A Luxury Collection Hotel, Bangkok",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293916-d302456-Reviews-The_Athenee_Hotel_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Bangkok-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",hotels,5.0,5.0
Probably the hardest of the 6 Monastries to access but well worth the effort!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Greece and yesterday we managed to pay a long awaited visit to Meteora.

Whilst there we managed to visit 3 of the 6 remaining Monastries and Holy Trinity was the second of these after Saint Stephens. Whilst the former is the easiest one to access (ie no steps), Holy Trinity is probably the hardest as it is a long walk down and a long way up to access the Monastry.

As such, it come as no surprise to learn that this location featured in the 1981 James Bond film ‘For Your Eyes Only’!

All in all, a challenging place to access (certainly not one for the less able bodied) but well worth the effort to see at firsthand the challenges which the original inhabitants had to overcome in establishing themselves. How they did it is simply beyond me!!",October 2020,Holy Trinity Monastery (Agia Triada),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315843-d243294-Reviews-Holy_Trinity_Monastery_Agia_Triada-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
One of Athen’s most interesting Squares;,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Athens staying at the Grand Hyatt Hotel (Review to follow) and - although this may come as a surprise to some - amongst the most interesting places we have visited is Monastiraki Square.

This can be accessed via Ermou Street (one of Athen’s best known shopping streets) and what makes this so interesting is the many different religious and other attractions in the immediate vicinity - Hadrian’s Library, Pantanassa Church & Tsisdarakis Mosque - all overlooked by the Parthenon!

Another good reason for visiting the Square is that it is a great doorway to the Flea Market which - for my money - is a much better place to shop than the nearby Ermou Street!!",October 2020,Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d265865-Reviews-Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great Find!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Athens and earlier today had some lunch at 7 Cactus which is a 10 minute walk from the Acropolis Museum.

We were warmly welcomed to this small but cosy property and were soon enjoying 2 freshly squeezed orange juices - so much so that we placed a repeat order. These went well with our meals - I ordered the meatballs and my wife fried eggs and spinach cake. Both were delicious and service throughout was excellent.

All in all, a most enjoyable lunch and certainly one we would be happy to repeat.",October 2020,7 Cactus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12870457-Reviews-7_Cactus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Guaranteed a warm Welcome!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Athens and twice in the vicinity of the Acropolis Museum we visited Elaea Mezedadiko for drinks and snacks (particularly liked the Hazelnut Cake).

It is one of the many restaurants in that area but we we were certainly warmly received on both our visits and - as such - would certainly recommend this particular property to others.",October 2020,Elaea Mezedadiko,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10587843-Reviews-Elaea_Mezedadiko-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Changing of the Guard Greek Style!,"Visitors to Athens should make a point of being at the Greek Parliament Building at Syntagma Square on the hour to watch the 10 minute Changing of the Guard although - if really interested - make a point of going along at 1100 hours on a Sunday when the Changeover is carried out in added splendour!

My wife and myself were there today - together with 50+ others - to watch the 1700 hours changeover and this was impressive enough. You do feel anxious for the young guards themselves as one wrong step/turn and I’m sure they would be living with the consequences for a long time to come!!

Certainly worth 10-15 minutes of anyone’s time!",October 2020,Changing of the Guard Ceremony,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12064411-Reviews-Changing_of_the_Guard_Ceremony-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Most comfortable and enjoyable way to see this unique destination!,"My wife and myself have been frequent visitors to Greece over the years but the one attraction that had eluded us was Meteora and we were delighted to include this full day private tour in our latest itinerary.

It’s not the cheapest option but bearing in mind that Meteora is (depending on traffic flows) a 4 hour drive Athens - a Private Tour not only in a new Mercedes Benz but with an extremely good and knowledgeable driver (Ioannis) represents excellent value for money.

Our particular trip went like clockwork from start to finish. We departed on time - briefly stopped at the Leonidas Monument en route, visited 3 Monastries (Saint Stephen, Holy Trinity & Great Meteoron), had a most enjoyable lunch and were back at our Athens Hotel by 1900 hours.

Much of the credit for this goes to Ioannis who proved excellent company throughout the day - so much so that I would not only strongly recommend Crispy Local to other discerning visitors but we will shortly be exploring some of the many other bespoke Greek holiday options that they have to offer.",October 2020,Meteora Full Day Private Trip from Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d19011388-Meteora_Full_Day_Private_Trip_from_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
Easiest Monastry to Access,"My wife and myself visited 3 of the 6 Monastries during our visit to Meteora today and St Stephan’s was the first of these.

As it transpired, this was the easiest one to access and, as such, it tends to be one of the busiest but, even so - and not surprising in the circumstances - they were not too many visitors at any of the Monastries we visited. Adult Entry fee is 3 Euros which not only represents good value for money but has provided an excellent source of income for the 6 Monasteries to ensure they are all in good living/working order.",October 2020,Agios Stefanos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315843-d243297-Reviews-Agios_Stefanos-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great Local Eatery,"My wife and myself visited Meteora earlier today (see separate Review) and after having taken in the delights of 3 of the remaining 6 Monasteries our driver took us to his favourite local restaurant Meteoran Panorama for a well-earned lunch.

It proved to be an excellent choice in a great location (backing onto the stunning rocky outcrops) where we were quickly made to feel most welcome. As it was a warm day we chose to sit inside and our orders (local mushroom starters followed by Moussaka & Roast Lamb mains) were promptly taken by Monika who does a great job in promoting the local cuisine.

Everything was delicious as was the orange tart & vanilla ice cream provided free of charge by the property. All in all, a most enjoyable lunch at what is probably one of the best restaurants in town.",October 2020,Meteoron Panorama,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315843-d1216350-Reviews-Meteoron_Panorama-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Impressive Monument Celebrating an important Spartan Victory.,"En route to Meteora from Athens this morning our driver pointed out the Leonidas Monument which we briefly stopped to see.

It certainly was worth a brief stop which suited our purposes but there is a Museum nearby for anyone wanting to find out more details about this important Spartan victory.",October 2020,Leonidas Monument,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189412-d282022-Reviews-Leonidas_Monument-Thermopylae_Phthiotis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Thermopylae, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Unique In every sense of the word!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Greece and earlier today visited Meteora which is one place we have both long been looking forward to seeing at firsthand.

From various postcards - and feedback from other people - we knew Meteora was something special but it is only after seeing it at firsthand that one fully appreciates just what a unique place it is. This is reinforced by visiting some of the Monasteries (we went to 3 of the remaining 6) which all have their own Individual characteristics including being located in amazing places on the various rocky outcrops.

How this was achieved hundreds of years ago is beyond me but I’m glad it was as it has not only given many people much pleasure but quite right that Meteora’s uniqueness has been fully recognised by UNESCO.",October 2020,Meteora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1070999-d523805-Reviews-Meteora-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Shadow of its former self!!,"As part of full private tour of Athens, my wife and myself visited the Temple of Olympian Zeus earlier today.

It’s hard to believe that this used to be Greece’s largest Temple - one that took 800 years to build. As such, a great shame that more of the original construction are not on view today - indeed it’s sad to see that one of the relatively few columns was blown over by a recent storm (fortunately, nobody was in the vicinity at the time).

There is, however, plenty of other artefacts (including Hadrian’s Gate) to see and - should like us you be the holder of a combined ticket - there is no entrance fee to pay!",October 2020,Temple of Olympian Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242844-Reviews-Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Well worth seeing even from the outside!,"My wife and myself visited the Panathenaic Stadium (originally built In 1896 to host the fIrst Olympic Games outside Olympus) earlier today as part of a full day’s tour of Athens.

As we were a little tight on time, we decided just to view the impressive Stadium from the outside which was still well worth doing. It is probably one of Athens’ less visited attractions and I would encourage more visitors to spare 30 minutes of their time to do so as - largely because it is constructed of marble - it resisted the ravages of time better than most other similar vintage attractions!",October 2020,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Natural follow-on to any Acropolis visit!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Athens staying at the Grand Hyatt (Review to follow) and this morning we visited the Acropolis (see separate Review) and during this couldn’t fail to notice the Ancient Agora of Athens below.

Fortunately, we had opted for the 30 Euros Combined entrance ticket which covered several other attractions including the Ancient Agora of Athens. As such, we went there from the Acropolis and - with an extremely well preserved temple of Hephaestus, impressive Stoa of Attalos Building and so much more to see - this proved an excellent move, one I would strongly recommend others to replicate.",October 2020,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Ideal time to visit!,"It would a great shame for anyone coming to Athens not to visit both the Parthenon and the Acropolis site - certainly something they wouldn’t have any difficulty in finding as it is the tallest landmark in the city!

My wife and myself had the pleasure of doing so this morning and with beautiful weather and hardly any other visitors (no queue at the Ticket Office) we couldn’t have picked a more ideal time.

Great Way to not only see many of the leading attractions but gain a better understanding of the city.,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Athens staying at the Grand Hyatt (Review to follow) where our driver/guide Visallis from Olive Sea Travel collected us at 0830 this morning in a very comfortable people carrier.

From past experience it is often the quality of one’s driver/guide (ie rather than just the Attractions) that determine the success of these full day tours and Visallis was an excellent Ambassador for his company - knowledgeable, personable and professional. As such we had a most enjoyable day - enhanced by it being a lovely Autumnal day and, not surprisingly in the circumstances, a welcome lack of other visitors.

All the sites we visited were of interest although it is the Acropolis which was the cream of the crop and one - thanks to our 30 Euros Combined ticket being valid for 5 days - we will revisit before returning to London.",October 2020,Athens Full Day Private Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d13330909-Athens_Full_Day_Private_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
No trip to Athens is complete without having visited the Acropolis!!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Athens staying at the Grand Hyatt (Review to follow) and this morning we visited the Acropolis.

The conditions were ideal - a gorgeous Autumnal Day and very few (certainly by normal standards) other visitors. On arrival at the Payment Booth, we opted for the Adult 30 Euros Combined ticket which can not only be used to gain entry to a number of other Attractions (Ancient Agora, Hadrian’s Library, Kerameikos, Aristotle’s School, Olympieion & Roman Agora) but is valid for 5 days.

Although parts of the Acropolis resemble a Building site (and this has probably been the case for many years as so much more work remains to be done) this is a world class attraction and no visit to Athens can be regarded as complete without having witnessed this experience at firsthand. Believe me, there will never be a better time to do so than right now!!",October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Older property beginning to show its age but still a good COVID-19 Haven!!,"My wife and myself are nearing the end of a 6 night stay at the Grecotel Cape Sounio Resort which is 67 Kms south of Athens and a popular local weekend retreat.

The property opened in 1979 (refurbished in 2004) so is understandably beginning to show its age (ie furnishings are tired and certain amenities (safes, shaving mirrors etc) require early replacement. Indeed, some rooms do not compare favourably with those advertised on the property’s website - a problem Andreas quickly overcame for us by finding a suitable alternative (#106). This much enhanced our stay!

Other distinct pluses are how the property has adopted comprehensive COVID-19 measures (plenty of hand sanitisers and a simple rule of wearing a mask indoors and use your own judgement outdoors. The staff are also outstanding - everyone coming across as not only pleasant but prepared to go the extra mile.

This was particularly so at the beach (we preferred the sandy one) where Harris does an outstanding job. The same applies to the Front of House, F & B and Housekeeping teams. No complaints either with the Breakfast & Dinner arrangements where the quality of food was consistently high and the free bottled water a nice touch.

What I also liked was the Temple of Poseidon not only being on permanent view but the 4 Kms round trip makes an excellent post-Breakfast walk.

Great Place to visit before or after visiting the Temple of Poseidon.,"Anyone visiting the Temple of Poseidon can not fail to see Naos Cafe Restaurant which - besides being an ideal place for a drink or a snack (before or after your visit to the Temple - the main entrance is less than 50 metres away) - also has great views.

Hard to miss and well worth a visit!,"My wife and myself are holidaying at Cape Sounio (staying at the Grecotel Sounio Resort - Review to follow) and this morning I walked (4 kms approx round trip) to the nearby Temple of Poseidon - hard to miss as it is located at the top of a promontory overlooking the sea.

On arrival, the entrance is just a short distance from a well established and we’ll patronised Restaurant/Gift Store . The adult entry fee is 10 Euros but seniors such as myself this is reduced to 5 Euros on production of any required documentation.

The site itself is not extensive but it offers spectacular panoramic views including -later in the day - and often accompanied by an influx of visitors - the sunset which clearly played an integral role in the Temple’s location.

Off the beaten path but well worth a visit!,"Earlier today I was taken for a business lunch at the Stonhouse which is in one of the back streets of Clapham - certainly not easy to find but, as I discovered, clearly a local favourite!

It was a lovely day so we chose to sit in the outside courtyard area. Under strict COVID-19 protocol everything (registration and food/drink orders) was done online. This did not effect the service levels which were excellent throughout our stay.

We both ordered the Fish (Hake), Chips & Mushy Peas which were good value at £13.50 each but even better when the generous discount (an extension of the Chancellor’s popular ‘’Eat Out’ initiative) had been applied.

Ideal COVID-19 Haven!,"After an absence of more than 2 years - and under very different circumstances - my wife and myself are paying our second 10 night visit (see previous Review) to the Delfino Blu Wellness Boutique Hotel.

The result, however, has been very much the same with the property (and indeed Corfu itself - it would have been a travesty if either of the UK or Welsh Governments had included this on their respective Greek Island self-quarantine lists and the less said about the Scottish Government’s actions the better!!) proving the ideal COVID-19 haven.

This has been achieved by the owner Costas (who still greets all his guests with a smile despite having endured his most challenging season (160+ cancellations at a property that normally starts each one with 90+% occupancy!) for many years) having instituted a strict COVID-19 regime. He has been greatly assisted by having so many of his excellent colleagues - more like an extended family than staff - who all go well out of their way to not only meet the guests’ needs but making them all feel genuinely welcome.

In this respect, I must thank them all - including both the outstanding F&B and Housekeeping teams but in particular: Christos, Emilia, Irini & Yannis who do such a great effort every morning and evening serving Breakfast & Dinner at Kohali (Heads & Shoulders the best restaurant in town - see separate Review), Yannis & George who look after the Swimming Pool & Bar area as well as the two Georges who oversee the Reception and Bookings process. They all - together with Costas who pops up all over the property - play their part in ensuring guests have a memorable stay even if it’s only for one night or a month!

Not to be missed!,"After 2 years my wife and myself are paying a return visit to the town of Agios Stefanos and whether you are on the beach or in the town it is difficult not to spot the cross on the top of the hill.

Hopefully, like us, most able bodied visitors will take the trouble to go up the - admittedly steep - hill to discover the delightful ‘Little (and even by Greek standards it is little!) Agios Stefanos Church’ which is open to visitors. It also has some very interesting memorial stones outside the Church of some of the many regular visitors to this attractive town (some have been coming here for 20 years or more) who have sadly passed away.

One reason for doings so is to enjoy both our Breakfasts and Dinners at the Hotel’s Restaurant Kohili. As with our previous stay, the quality of food and service is first-rate and by - a long way - the best restaurant in town.

Difficult to Miss!,"Wherever you find yourself in the small town of Agios Stefanos it is difficult to miss the cross on the top of the Headland.

So much so, it is well worth a visit and can be reached by a 20-30 minute walk up the relatively steep hill and then follow the dirt/rocky path to the cross. On arrival, there is a very small Chapel/Church that was probably constructed 10 years ago and it is open to visitors.

Outside the Chapel/Church there are several plies of stones which are momentos to previous visitors who clearly loved Agios Stefanos (many visitors have been coming here for many years - some 20 years or more!) and have since passed away.

It really is a very special attraction and one that I would recommend to all able-bodied people to visit at least once during their visit to this lovely town.",September 2020,Little Agios Stefanos Chuch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g775838-d21270488-Reviews-Little_Agios_Stefanos_Chuch-Agios_Stefanos_Avliotes_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
As Good as Ever!,"It’s over 2 years since my wife and myself last visited Agios Stefanos and during our stay we have been interested - particularly, in the current circumstances - to see how many of our favourite haunts.were faring.

One of these is Akrotiri Cafe at the top of hill with panoramic views of both Arillas and Agios Stefanos which we were delighted to find not only open for business but pretty full with customers. Despite that, we managed to find ourselves a nice inside table to enjoy our cappuccinos together with a delicious lemon meringue pie. All for less than Euros 10 which was excellent value for money.

As such, I suspect we will paying at least one return visit before heading home And strongly recommend others to do likewise - they won’t be disappointed!!",September 2020,Akrotiri Cafe north-west Corfu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g775935-d3370621-Reviews-Akrotiri_Cafe_north_west_Corfu-Arillas_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
More Sheltered but less user-friendly than nearby Agios Stefanos Beach,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Agios Stefanos staying at the excellent Delfino Blu Hotel (Review to follow) and - with the current windy conditions - earlier today paid a visit to nearby Arillas as the beach there appeared to be far more sheltered.

In the event, we discovered that Arillas Beach was also experiencing windy conditions and - although there were some lovely secluded spots - it was far narrower (and stony in places) than its more extensive Agios Stefanos counterpart which is arguably Corfu’s leading beach?

As such, we will stick to this side of the hill but equally can see why many others find Arillas Beach to their liking!",September 2020,Arillas Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189458-d1087794-Reviews-Arillas_Beach-Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
User-friendly Service and Stunning Views,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying at Agios Nicholas (staying at the excellent Delfino Blu - Review to follow) and earlier today we walked over the hill to nearby Arillas.

En route, we passed the Gravia Snack Bar Cafe which had stunning views of the bay below and decided to pop in for a drink on our return journey. We duly did so and much enjoyed 2 freshly squeezed orange juices (Euros 4 each which was a little on the high side) and the user-friendly service.

Welcome Return to what may well be Corfu’s best beach?,"After a 2 year absence (see previous review), it is nice to be back in Agios Stefanos again and to see the beach looking in such good order.

So far, I have yet to see any Jellyfish and relatively little seaweed. The same applies to the number of visitors which - particularly in the current circumstances - are understandably well down. Indeed some of the larger Hotels remain closed.

As for the beach itself, it is in good order - plenty of hard sand which, coupled with shallow water, makes it ideal for both swimming and walking. The nudist area still remains but numbers are also well down!

All in all, arguably the best beach on the Island?",September 2020,Agios Stefanos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g775838-d9829341-Reviews-Agios_Stefanos_Beach-Agios_Stefanos_Avliotes_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Smooth Return both before and during the flight,"After an enforced absence of flying for 6 months, my wife and myself traveled on BA earlier today from Heathrow (T5) to Kerkyra/Corfu earlier today.

The flight itself was full but the new Covid service was excellent and - despite departing Heathrow 15/20 minutes late (due to lengthier Boarding arrangements which are now sensibly done by disposing of the Priority Boarding process and starting with the back 5 rows of the plane) - we arrived 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Masks are mandatory (except when eating & drinking) and the service was first-rate.

Prior to the flight, BA kept us well informed of the new COVID-related arrangements although I would recommend passengers to arrive 2 and a half hours before their flights as it took us a good hour to check-in and go through security.

The Lounge was not as busy as usual and ordering meals (Breakfast in our case) online works very well. Our orders were spot on and all delivered within a matter of minutes.

All in all, a most enjoyable experience - quite a contrast to the recent TUI flight from nearby Zante to Cardiff which, hopefully, has not deterred too many UK visitors from flying to Greece which is as beautiful as ever!",September 2020,British Airways,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729039-Reviews-British-Airways,World,flights,5.0,3.5
Coming out of Hibernation!,"With more of London’s leading Attractions now re-opening their doors to the public, my wife and myself visited the V & A Museum (current entrance is in Exhibition Road 15 where you should plan on arriving 15 mins before your allotted time and exit via Cromwell Road) earlier today.

All bookings need to be made in advance online in and - with only 2 floors (ground & first) currently open - the property is probably operating at little more than 10% capacity so now is an excellent time to visit. Entrance is also free but donations are most welcome and anyone not making at least the minimum one of £5 should hang their head in shame - particularly, in the current circumstances!!

Despite only having 2 floors open to the public (see above), there are no shortage of quality artefacts & exhibits from around the globe to see at one’s leisure. Time should also be allowed for a drink and a snack from the Cafe in the delightful John Madejski Garden as well as a quick look around the well stocked Shop.

Traditional Property providing excellent service but in urgent need of renovation,"My wife and myself are nearing the end of a 2 night stay at the Langtry Manor Hotel in Bournemouth (located in the upmarket suburb of East Cliff - a 20/30 minute walk from the Beach and Pier respectively).

It is without doubt a nice property that has been tastefully furnished over the years but has now reached the point where it needs to take a leaf out of its sister property’s (Derby Manor - just across the road where patrons can enjoy an excellent breakfast) and institute a comprehensive refurbishment programme.

A good example being our room (the Lily Langtry Suite) which is initially easy on the eye - but on closer inspection - rather tired with some fittings (Ie our toilet roll holder fell off the wall!) requiring early replacement. The balcony is also a nice feature but this - particularly the steps - requires an early upgrade and mind your head (you have been warned!).

Whilst a novel experience, I was also not personally enamoured with either having to take a shower in the room itself but this was countered by much enjoying the comfortable 4 Poster Bed!

Also very much on the positive side was the excellent customer service provided throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble and this approach is undoubtedly one of the property’s greatest assets.

All in all, an enjoyable stay but age is beginning to catch up with the property and - as already appears to have been taken on board - this needs addressing sooner rather than later before regular guests do far more than just have their breakfast across the road!",August 2020,Langtry Manor Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186262-d192235-Reviews-Langtry_Manor_Hotel-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great Location accompanied by excellent food and service.,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Bournemouth (staying at the Langtry Manor Hotel - Review to follow) and we visited nearby Christchurch where we lunched at The Noisy Lobster at Avon Beach.

Avon Beach itself is not as sandy as the 7 mile stretch that Bournemouth is blessed with but I doubt it has many restaurants of the same calibre as The Noisy Lobster which was not only pretty busy when we arrived shortly after noon but there 6 groups ahead of us in the queue. No matter, the greeting process proved a very efficient one and we were seated at a nice indoor table (all the outside ones - including the very popular upstairs deck area - were already taken) with 10/15 minutes.

Both our drinks and food orders (Crab & Crispy Calamari Linguini for me whilst my wife opted for the Lightly Spiced & Aromatic Seafood Curry) were promptly taken. Everything was very well handled and - despite how busy the property was - we certainly didn’t have to wait long for our meals which were both extremely good. Just a shame that - being a Thursday - we missed out on the Chancellor’s £10 Eat Out discount but you can’t have everything!

All in all, a most enjoyable lunch at a property which thoroughly deserves its popularity.",August 2020,The Noisy Lobster at Avon Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190800-d2354883-Reviews-The_Noisy_Lobster_at_Avon_Beach-Christchurch_Dorset_England.html,"Christchurch, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A must see for all visitors!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Bournemouth and earlier today we visited nearby (45 minute drive depending on both the volume of traffic and the weather as the heavens opened on our return journey which took much longer that the outgoing one) Christchurch.

One of the main reason for going to Christchurch was to see the Priory which did not disappoint from Both the outside (an impressive building by any standards and easily visible from the town centre) and inside (particularly around the Altar area). Entry is free but donations are most welcome and don’t forget to visit the well stocked shop - and the well kept gardens - on departure.",August 2020,Christchurch Priory Church,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190800-d218196-Reviews-Christchurch_Priory_Church-Christchurch_Dorset_England.html,"Christchurch, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Poor Neighbour!,"My wife and myself are currently visiting Bournemouth (staying at the Orchid Hotel - see separate Review) and this evening we walked along the beach path to Boscombe.

The main reason for doing so was to visit the Pier which turned out to be something of a disappointment as it has very little to offer (except to the relatively large number of fisherman) compared to the nearby Bournemouth one. This would appear not to have been the case in the past but what facilities there are on view (notably a strange mini golf which - if still in operation - uses golf balls that can be eaten by the local fish!) have been left to go to rack and ruin.

As such, some early investment is urgently required but with the best will in the world - particularly, with the UK having just entered what could prove to be a long Recession - this is most unlikely to be forthcoming!",August 2020,Boscombe Pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186262-d8528586-Reviews-Boscombe_Pier-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",attractions,2.0,4.0
First Class Attraction,"My wife and myself are currently visiting Bournemouth - staying at the Orchid Hotel (see separate Review) - and earlier today we visited the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum which is located immediately above the Royal Bath Hotel.

Bookings need to be made in advance online and - at first blush - my expectations were not overly high. However, that all changed on entering the property where the staff are most welcoming and after watching the introductory 10 minute video - not the easiest to listen to as the noise carries easily from the Cafe which is located immediately above.

That aside, there are no shortage of interesting, high-quality artefacts & exhibits to see in both the House and the various Galleries. This is supplemented by lovely gardens and nice Cafe & Shop and - as such - I would strongly recommend this attraction to all visitors to Bournemouth as well as a good number of residents who probably have yet to see at firsthand what is on offer.

Great Location and Excellent Service both before and during our stay.,"My wife and myself were originally due to stay at the Orchid Hotel in late-June on a Secret Escapes package but - due to the ongoing Coronavirus Pandemic - we were unable to do so.

As such, I subsequently contacted the Hotel to rearrange the booking and they could not have been more helpful. Indeed, that very positive approach has very much to the fore throughout our stay and is undoubtedly one of the Hotel’s greatest assets.

As for the property, it is well located in Eastcliffe (one of best local suburbs) and a 10/15 minute walk to the Pier. It also appears to have been recently refurbished and we were certainly very happy with our room which overlooked the front car park. The king size bed was most comfortable and I was particularly pleased with the stand alone shower unit. One improvement - particularly as our stay coincided with some really warm weather - would have been a small refrigerator.

On the F & B front, unfortunately, the 34 Restaurant (which has had many outstanding Reviews) was not open for Dinner during our stay but the Breakfasts (with full English now back on the menu) were very good as was the Afternoon Tea which was part of our original Secret Escapes package and something the Kitchen Staff went out of their way to prepare for us. Another example of the Orchid Hotel going that extra mile for their clientele.

Excellent Breakfasts but not able to sample Dinner.,"My wife and myself are currently visiting Bournemouth staying at the Orchid Hotel (Review to follow) and - after reading many positive Reviews - were looking to dining at the Hotel’s “No 34” Restaurant.

As it happens, the No 34.Restaurant has just reopened but only on Friday & Saturday evenings so we missed out on Dinners (a shame as there are relatively few other restaurants in the vicinity) but were more than happy with the Breakfasts which now also include cooked one.

In addition, we had a very nice Afternoon Tea but actually had this in the Courtyard which proved an excellent setting.

Great Location & Extremely User-Friendly.,"On our first visit to any city/town, my wife and myself try to pay an early visit to the local Tourist/Visitors’ Information Centre and our Bournemouth trip proved no exception!

In this instance, the Tourist Information Centre is very well located - within less than a minutes walk from the entrance to the Pier. On arrival there - and after making good use of the hand sanitizer - we had a most helpful discussion with the gentleman on duty. In particular, he recommended some excellent nearby restaurants (one of which Westbeach we later lunched at and see subsequent Review) and good advice.

The Centre also has some nice & well-priced gifts which we returned later to buy together with some postcards.

Average at best and more commercial than tourist-related!,"My wife and myself are currently visiting Bournemouth and were both very much looking forward to our visit this morning to Poole - particularly the harbour/quay where we hoped to find some good seafood restaurants.

Unfortunately, we left Poole disappointed as - after a long walk through the extended Shopping Parade (with many of the outlets either permanently or temporarily closed) from the Bus Station, we arrived at the Quay which - with the exception of queues of people awaiting various Boat Trips - gave the impression of being very much a Commercial Port.

In addition, it proved impossible to find a restaurant to our liking so we returned to Bournemouth much earlier than originally planned!",August 2020,Poole Harbour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190727-d735772-Reviews-Poole_Harbour-Poole_Dorset_England.html,"Poole, United Kingdom",attractions,2.0,4.5
Hidden Gem!,"En route to Bournemouth Bus Station via the Gardens this morning my wife and myself spotted the Picnic Park Deli (which has 2 outside seating areas - both with lovely views although preferable to get one of the shady tables if at all possible) and decided to return there for a drink and bite to eat on our Return from Poole.

We duly did so and - after a short wait in the queue (it is a popular place!) - we were fortunate enough to secure a shady table in the main seating area. We did so with our drinks (2 lovely cappuccinos) and our meals (we both opted for the mashed avocado on sourdough with a poached egg) followed shortly afterwards. This was washed down by 3 scoops of ice-cream.

Service throughout was excellent - as was the value for money (assisted by the Chancellors most welcome 50% Eat Out initiative) and this is certainly a local eatery that I would strongly recommend to others.",August 2020,Picnic Park Deli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186262-d10499137-Reviews-Picnic_Park_Deli-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Not the greatest Pier but shouldn’t be missed!,"On our first visit to Bournemouth, my wife and myself headed straight to the beachfront where the centrepiece is the Pier and something that all visitors should have a look around during their stay.

The reason is that it is not expensive (Adults £1.30 each and repeat visits can be made later in the day on production of your receipt) and you can see all 7 Kms of Bournemouth’s lovely Sandy beaches and just how busy there are - certainly not somewhere I would personally choose to spend much time in the current circumstances!

Good Location coupled with excellent food and service.,"With the COVID-19 Lockdown measures now being relaxed my wife and myself have ventured out of London for the first time in 5 months and are spending this week in Bournemouth.

We arrived at noon today and headed down to the sea front to find somewhere nice for lunch. After seeking advice at the Visitors Information Centre we opted for the nearby Westbeach Restaurant which overlooks the beach.

We were warmly welcomed and shown to a nice inside table (the outside ones are nice but very close to the constant flow of visitors going up and down the beach pathway). Both our drinks and food orders were promptly taken and although the latter took a while to arrive both our starters (Homous & Taramasalata Dips with hot pita bread) and mains (monkfish & sea bass filets with chips & salad) were excellent. The 3 scoops of local ice cream weren’t bad either!

Best of all, however, was our waitress Karolina who look after us extremely well from start to finish with the icing on the cake being the Chancellor’s £10 per person discount which made it even better value for money!

All in all, an excellent lunch - so much so that I suspect that we will fit in a return visit (probably for lunch as dinners are extremely popular - fully booked out for the last 2 weeks!) before returning to London at the end of the week!",August 2020,WestBeach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186262-d1005998-Reviews-WestBeach-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Opportune Time to visit one of the best National Galleries where service is with a smile!,"With many Lockdown measures now having been lifted, now is an excellent time to visit London’s leading attractions and earlier today my wife and myself visited the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square.

We had booked in advance on line and although there is no charge I would encourage all visitors to make a donation (we opted for £10 each and this represented good value for money). All E-ticket holders are requested to assemble in Salisbury Street 15 minutes before their designated time slot and - with this in mind - there is nothing to be gained arriving any earlier as the queue control works well and visitors are called forward on schedule.

After going through security, visitors need to go up 2 sets of stairs (there are tolets halfway up) and then should opt for a combination of the 3 routes (A, B & C) - all of which have an outstanding selection of paintings and take 30 mins approx to complete. Whichever combination is chosen, however, please do make a point of visiting the recently refurbished Room 32 as this is not to be missed!

Although it was pretty busy, and we didn’t have a reservation, we were fortunate to get on one of the indoor, alcove tables - good at the best of times but ideal in the current circumstances. We were promptly given our digital menus and opted for the £14 2 course set menu - both having the Soup of the Day (vegetable) + the Bavette steak (generous portions) and french fries.

Red Lion Revisited,"After so many months of Lockdown, it’s good to get back into circulation and - with this in mind - my wife, myself and a family friend had lunch earlier today at the Red Lion in Barnes.

This was not our first visit (see previous review) but it was our first post COVID-19 and a good opportunity to see how the property had responded to the many challenges this has posed. As is the norm these days, advance bookings (these are for inside tables only with the popular garden tables allocated on arrival on a first come first served basis) are required and this process is very well handled via the website.

We were warmly welcomed on arrival and shown to an inside table with - as there was some availability - the option to sit outside. We chose the latter and were given menus and our drinks order promptly taken. Ditto with our food order with all 3 of us opting for the Roast Norfolk Chicken Sunday Roast which was not only delicious but excellent value for money at £16.

All in all it was an excellent visit from start to visit - I was particularly impressed with the food, service and the way the management has adapted the property to accommodate to meet COVID-19 requirements.

One of our Favourites but some refurbishment would not go astray!,"My wife and myself (former Laguna Holiday Club members and now part of the Angsana Vacation Club - AVC) have stayed every year at the 79 room Laguna Holiday Club since it opened its doors in 2006 and we are now approaching the end of what has been yet another most enjoyable stay.

Whilst the property may lack the profile of some of it’s neighbours (Angsana, Banyan Tree, Dusit Thani & Outrigger) it has a charm all of its own which is why so many AVC members such as ourselves return year after year. Another reason is the excellent staff who always make us most welcome - notably Khun Ampai (keeps our room looking impeccable!), Khun Jeed & her colleagues on the Front Desk (couldn’t be more helpful & pleasant) and especially Khun Kung (transportation guru but able to answer any question you may have!).

The rooms themselves are spacious with good amenities and furnishings but they - together with the infrastructure (the condenser above our room played up - for the first time - during our latest stay and there are some drainage issues) - require updating. In this regard, I was pleased to learn that an extensive Refurbishment Plan is in the pipeline and will, hopefully, have been completed before the end of the year (ie before our next visit!).

Other highlights are the fact the property backs onto the impressive Laguna Golf Course and is only a 10/15 minute walk (even shorter Shuttle Bus ride although they - in common with the Boat Service - are not as good or regular as they used to be!) to Bang Tao Bay which, to my mind, has the best Beach on the Island.

Best Local Beach,"My wife and myself have been coming to Phuket every year for the last 20 years and - on every occasion - have stayed in the Bang Tao Bay area.

On reason for this is the proximity to Layan Beach which is by far the best half of the 2 beaches on the Bay. It is far less developed (ie from the Banyan Tree onwards), far less polluted (barely a Jellyfish or any rubbish in sight) and is ideal for a morning walk - something I try to do on every day of my Phuket stays.

Spared the Axe!,"My wife and myself are back in Phuket for our annual visit (a process which has now been going for over 15 years!) and have just been for a walk around Canal Village on the Laguna Phuket Resort.

It was good to see it still in operation and on our last visit there were rumours of the site being redeveloped. However, with so much other construction work going on (primarily new Apartment Blocks targeted at the growing number of Chinese & Russian visitors), it has been spared the axe - at least for the time being!!

Although a number of outlets have closed it is good to see many of the regular ones (Jim Thompson, Bangkok Hospital, Sports Shop, Foreign Exchange etc) still there and even a few news ones - The Barrel which is primarily a Wine Shop). Also good to see a new roadway has been built to access both the Chapel and Canal Village as it will be a sad day when these are no longer in place.

All in all, Canal Village is still very much up and running with an Evening Fair taking place from 1600-2200 hours every Thursday up until the end of March.",February 2020,Canal Village Shopping Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1224250-d5575280-Reviews-Canal_Village_Shopping_Centre-Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",attractions,4.0,3.0
Big Improvement on Boat Avenue!,"My wife and myself are back in Phuket again on our annual visit and were surprised to find how run down Villa Supermarket (and much of the surrounding area) had become since our last visit when it was flourishing.

The answer soon became clear when we discovered a new Shopping Area “Porto de Phuket” had not only opened 3 months ago but it was just a few blocks away! This has a range of retail/restaurant outlets including a huge Central Food Store where you can buy everything - indeed it has an excellent meals section where we much enjoyed a late lunch (chicken & grill vegetables - sold by weight).

All in all, a most positive development for visitors (and residents) such as ourselves but not for many of the outlets in Boat Avenue who are clearly suffering as a result!",February 2020,Porto de Phuket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g15274191-d19806729-Reviews-Porto_de_Phuket-Cherngtalay_Choeng_Thale_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",attractions,4.0,3.5
Yet Another Year on but - for the first time - more Minuses than Pluses!!,"My wife and myself are back on our annual visit to Phuket and I have already had 2 lovely (100 minute) walks on my all time favourite Bang Tao Beach - within walking distance from where we stay at the Laguna Holiday Club (separate Review to follow).

The walk itself was a good as ever - nice hard, golden sand and, as I tend to walk early mornings, a nice mix of shadow and sand. I was, however, surprised to see so much Jellyfish activity and the continued presence of the Jet Ski operators - most of which lack insurance and anyone hiring one of these is literally (particularly, following the recent tragic accident in which several Russian teenagers died) taking a huge risk!

Of most concern, however, was the construction of several new apartment blocks (no doubt, primarily targeted at the growing number of Chinese & Russian visitors) at the Angsana Hotel! This does nothing to enhance Bang Tao Beach nor bodes well for the future - thus my lower overall rating!",February 2020,Bang Tao Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293920-d592496-Reviews-Bang_Tao_Beach-Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",attractions,4.0,4.5

As good as ever!,"I have been a big fan of THAI Airways for a long time (in excess of 200 flights in all) but haven’t used them a great deal in recent years.

Earlier today, however, my wife flew on THAI from Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi) to Phuket and even before we boarded the aircraft I was pleased to see a greater variety (in addition to my favourite Tuna Sandwiches!) of food at the Domestic Thai Royal Silk Lounge where we always sit in the a Garden Section which is much nicer than the rest of the Lounge!

As for the flight itself, it departed and arrived on time and we enjoyed a nice lunch.

One of Smaller Temples but well worth visiting.,"Together with 24 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself visited Ta Som Temple yesterday morning.

Whilst one of the smaller Temples in this impressive complex, it has something for everyone - including a huge tree which is in the process of destroying one of entrances. Certainly well worth visiting as it can be viewed relatively quickly - particularly, at present in the absence of any Chinese visitors.",February 2020,Ta Som,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2366676-d1911328-Reviews-Ta_Som-Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap Province, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent Airline from start to finish!,"My wife and myself flew from Siem Reap to Bangkok on Thai Smile Airways.

The whole process from check-in to arriving in Bangkok 10 minutes early - not bad when the scheduled flight time was only 35 minutes. The on-board staff were excellent and even found time to serve us all with a tasty light meal.

Not much to see!!,"Together with 24 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself visited Neak Pean Temple yesterday morning.

The approach (wooden pedestrian bridge across the lake) promised much but on arrival there was - particularly, compared to the many other magnificent Temples in the complex - very little to see. I, for one, will not be paying a return visit!!",February 2020,Neak Pean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d552511-Reviews-Neak_Pean-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,3.0,4.0
Excellent Boutique Property.,"Together with 24 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself have just completed a most enjoyable 3 night stay at the Shinta Mani Angkor Hotel which is, literally, across the road from its older sister property Shinta Mani Shack (open to Shinta Mani Angkor residents which is good as it has nice gardens - with some attractive birdlife - and a larger swimming pool).

It is without doubt - and I’m a frequent traveller - an excellent property. The very warm reception on arrival sets the scene which continued throughout our stay. Rooms are spacious and tastefully furnished - I particularly like the comfortable bed and the large, waterfall shower unit.

On the F + B front, the buffet breakfast (supplemented by a generous menu) is one of the best I have come across. We also had a Group Dinner on the first evening of our stay which very good. Above all, however, service throughout was first class.

Another positive note was that two members of our Group had last minute problems with their air tickets which - on learning of the problem - the GM resolved for them.

All in all, a most enjoyable stay at an excellent property which I would gladly recommend to others who won’t be disappointed!",February 2020,Shinta Mani Angkor Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297390-d472278-Reviews-Shinta_Mani_Angkor_Hotel-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",hotels,5.0,5.0
"Excellent Food, Service & Entertainment;","Together with 24 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself have just returned from our final Group Dinner at the Kanell Dinner Show.

I must it would have been difficult to have found a better venue as the whole package (food - we had the Asian Fusion set menu, service & entertainment) was first class.

Interesting Temple but a step down from many of its illustrious neighbours!,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself visited the Preah Khan (Sacred Sword) Temple this morning which was built by King Jayavarman for his father in the 12th century.

Whilst I enjoyed my visit - and this may well be due to having seen several other outstanding Temples in the last couple of days - I did find walking the length (900 metres) of this one of less interest. It appeared that Preah Khan has received less attention (and funding) than the other Temples?

Nonetheless, well worth seeing but temper your expectations!",February 2020,Preah Khan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d552505-Reviews-Preah_Khan-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Get’s better as the trip goes on but scope to be ripped off!,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself visited Chong Kneas Floating Village this afternoon which is 15-20 minute drive from Siem Reap.

Our Group were allocated their own boat (nothing out of the ordinary but perfectly fit for purpose - life jackets were supplied) and 15 minutes after our arrival the Grouping were heading down the muddy and shallow (the Dry Season is certainly taking its toll) river. For the first 20 minutes or so there is very little (except plenty of rubbish - I really wish Cambodians would take more pride in their country!) but then Chong Kneas Floating Village comes into view.

It was certainly bigger than I expect and - besides many Houseboats - has a School, Catholic Church, Chinese Temple, Crocodile Farm, Restaurants & Shops. We were also approached by 2 local speed boats with relatively young people adorned with Pythons around their necks! Clearly after some form of cash payment but they went away when nothing was forthcoming!

On return, we were greeted by a group of younger children trying to sell souvenir plates with our individual photos (taken as we boarded the boat) for US$5 each. This was a little on the high side but - as they were not open to bartering - many of the plates remained unsold!

All in all, a worthwhile visit but one better conducted by a Group such as ours rather than on your own or as a couple!",February 2020,Chong Kneas Floating Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d1155805-Reviews-Chong_Kneas_Floating_Village-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,4.0,2.0
Excellent Food & Service at a most worthwhile Restaurant.,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself lunched today at Marum which has recently opened and is a sister property to Friends & Romdeng who train marginalised young people (many street children) for restaurant work.

The property itself has a nice garden area and is on 2 floors. Our Group was allocated 2 large tables on the second floor. Food & Drinks were soon forthcoming and all concerned had a most enjoyable lunch after which many members visited the Gift Shop on the Ground floor.

Well worth a visit and I hope many others do so.",February 2020,Marum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d3533708-Reviews-Marum-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Magnificent Temple with Faces everywhere you look!,"Together with 25 other members of the Anglo-Thai Society, my wife and myself visited the 12 Century masterpiece Temple of Angkor Thom which probably attracts just as many - if not more - visitors than its better known neighbour Angkor Wat!

It is very impressive on first sight and gets even more so on closer inspection. The main reasons from my perspective are the many faces looking down on you together with the general condition of the Temple. It really is not to be missed and my recommendation is to go there first and then onto Ta Prohm & Angkhor Wat (see separate Review) - particularly at present because, in the current absence of Chinese Tourists due to the terrible Coronavirus outbreak, there are not so many visitors at each of these sites which are all outstanding in their own way!",February 2020,Angkor Thom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d325215-Reviews-Angkor_Thom-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Not to be missed!,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself visited the Ta Prohm Temple complex this morning.

Although less impressive in magnitude and stature than either Angkor Thom & Angkor Wat, I found Ta Prohm the most interesting because of the way the roots of the massive Banyan Trees have embedded themselves around several of the Temple buildings.

Most Impressive Site but best seen/visited outside the Dry Season!,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself paid our first visit to the world famous Angkor Wat Temple complex this afternoon.

We had earlier purchased US$62 Three Day passes which were checked on arrival before we crossed the floating bridge over the man-made most to the Temple complex. Once across, we walked through the outer Temple before getting out first full view of the main a Temple.

It looked magnificent but I was disappointed (but not totally surprised bearing in mind our visit took place in the Dry Season) to find one of the two ponds closed and the other with very little water. Once inside the Temple, however, it is difficult not to be impressed with the magnitude of the Temple which - with the help of our guide - took a good 90 minutes to explore.

All in all, a most enjoyable visit - particularly, as there were relatively few other visitors there - but one from a personal viewpoint would have been enhanced by being there during the Rainy Season when both the frontal ponds would have been full and - in the process - shown Angkor Wat in all its glory!",February 2020,Angkor Wat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d317907-Reviews-Angkor_Wat-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,4.0,5.0

It is an attractive property with inside and outside seating on two floors. Our Group were allocated a large table on the second floor and both the food and the service were excellent - as indeed was the free WiFi service.

Most Impressive!,"Together with 25 Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself visited the impressive Sambor Prei Kuk - a UNESCO World Heritage Site that predates the far better known Angkor Wat by several centuries.

The site is such a large one that - depending on the time available - it’s important to target certain segments of the three main Temple groupings to get the optimum benefit. This is exactly what we did with each segment having something different to offer.

It proved a most enjoyable and educational visit - one enhanced by the fact that - besides the local couple who were having their wedding photos taken behind one of the Temples - we were virtually only visitors on the whole site!",February 2020,Sambor Prei Kuk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2366663-d1020069-Reviews-Sambor_Prei_Kuk-Kampong_Thom_Province.html,"Kampong Thom Province, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,4.5

The place to overnight en route to Siem Reap!,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself are nearing the end of an overnight stay at the Glorious Hotel & Spa en route to Siem Reap.

The Hotel certainly lives up to its name - an impressive building with an equally impressive swimming pool at the rear of the property. Both the rooms and the common/public areas are spacious and tastefully furnished. The beds are hard (not a problem for us!) and there is plenty of hot water in the bathroom which - again much to our liking - has a stand-alone shower.

Meals are taken in the large ground floor restaurant and we enjoyed a very nice group Dinner. Breakfast is served buffet style and there is an excellent egg station. Service at both meals was good - as was the in-house maintenance where a faulty light bulb was changed with 10 minutes.

Excellent Initiative.,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself visited Le Tonle Tourist Training Centre at Kratie this morning.

Our tour took in the Restaurant, Guest House Reception and the Travel Tours Office and it was very good to see how young Cambodians were being helped (receiving a range of training often leading to employment either locally or in Phnom Penh or Seam Reap) such a good initiative.

Peaceful Resort,"Together with 25 Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself are fast approaching the end of a 2 night stay at the Rajabori Villas Resort - probably the best Hotel on Koh Trong Island?

Certainly an interesting property to access - starting with catching a Ferry for the 5-10 minute journey from the Mainland followed by a motorbike taxi to take you (and luggage) across the extensive beach (ie during the Dry Season) before switching to a Tuktuk taxi for the final10-15 minute journey to the Resort!

Once there, the Resort gives a favourable impression with nice gardens, large swimming pool and attractive Villa-style accommodation. The Villas themselves are spacious but dark and hot due to the absence of air conditioning although there is a good fan and attractive wooden window shutters. Beds are on the hard side & the absence of a shower curtain often results in a messy bathroom! The WiFi service is also mediocre at best!

On the plus side, the staff are very willing and - in our experience - quick to respond to requests (our Villa lock was changed within 15 minutes). Few staff, however, speak good English which can result in some basic misunderstandings but - generally, speaking - all turns out well in the end!

Breakfast is served from 0645 hours onwards with a set menu. There is a limited choice but the quality is good. and other light can be ordered meals throughout the day.

All in all, a most enjoyable stay in very pleasant surrounds - one that Ali would be happy to repeat.",February 2020,Rajabori Villas Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g729351-d1977150-Reviews-Rajabori_Villas_Resort-Kratie_Kratie_Province.html,"Kratie, Cambodia",hotels,4.0,4.0
Oxen Tour that started well but ended badly!,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself went on a oxen tour earlier today.

The carts come with suitable padding for two people and are towed along by a pair of oxen. By and large one travels along good tracks but now and again be prepared for the odd bump or two.

We certainly got off to a good start but as the tour progressed the oxen decided to slow down and the driver found it increasingly difficult to keep them in line. Eventually, he began handling them roughly and this resulted in one of them making a bolt towards one of the bushes!

At this point, we decided enough was enough and we opted to finish the tour back to our hotel by motorcycle taxi/Tuk Tuk. A shame as the rest of the group all finished with their oxen who had been on their best behaviour!

It is a relatively large property with most of the seating inside which is just as well with the temperatures now into the mid-30’s! Both the quality of the food and service was good and free WiFi is provided for patrons.

A little run-down but well worth visiting.,"Together with 25 members of the Anglo-Thai Society, my wife and myself visited the Stung Treng Women’s Development Centre this morning.

The property is on a relatively large site and gives the impression of having been quite a big operation in the past. No so much the case these days as not only were a number of the buildings not in use but there were relatively few staff on the premises.

Our tour started with a visit to the Kindergarten/Nursery which was certainly well patronised with many of the 30+ children pleased to see some visitors. We then went to the nearby silk dyeing area before seeing some silk pieces being made.

The final part of our tour was to the Mekong Blue Shop where there are a variety of lovely items on sale for reasonable prices. We managed to find a nice silk rap for our niece’s forthcoming Birthday.

All in all, a most enjoyable visit and more such tours will only serve to help this good cause.",February 2020,Mekong Blue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g729353-d6731683-Reviews-Mekong_Blue-Stung_Treng_Stung_Treng_Province.html,"Stung Treng, Cambodia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Fine for a short stay.,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself are nearing the end of an overnight stay at the Golden River Hotel which - as we discovered this morning (having arrived after darkness had fallen last night) overlooks the impressive Sepok River.

The property itself is cheap and cheerful but is perfectly OK (decent size rooms, comfortable beds and plenty of hot water) for an overnight stay. Breakfast (buffet style) is taken immediately behind the main Hotel building.

Lighting in the rooms could be improved and it would be nice to have a few more hangers (we had 2 wire ones) in the wardrobe but - all in all - one must remember you are staying in rural Cambodia and the staff more than make up for these small shortfalls!",February 2020,Golden River Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g729353-d2290064-Reviews-Golden_River_Hotel-Stung_Treng_Stung_Treng_Province.html,"Stung Treng, Cambodia",hotels,4.0,3.5
Good Property on the banks of the Mekong.,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself spent last night at the Sala Done Khone Hotel.

We were allocated one of the Garden Villa-style rooms which was spacious with a large bed and nice shutters fitted with mesh - important as there are a few mosquitos around (pleased to see that a coil was lit up on our balcony. The bathroom was fine as was the shower for which there was no shortage of hot water.

On the F & B front, both Breakfast (which the Manager kindly agreed for us to have at 0630 hours rather than wait until the usual 0700 hours start) and the Group Dinner were at the a Restaurant overlooking the Mekong River. The quality of food and service for both meals was very good.

We arrived by coach and the Main Entrance is in a nice gardened area. We then travelled the 5-10 minute journey to the Falls on a VIP Golf Cart.

On arrival - and despite it being the Dry Season - the Falls (reputed to be the best in SE Asia) are impressive. Indeed, the mind boggles what they would look like at their peak!

Well worth doing but don’t come with high expectations!!,"Together with 22 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself are currently visiting Laos and earlier today whilst in the famous Si Phan Don (4000 Islands) we went on a 60 minute cruise to try to spot some of the increasingly rare Irrawaddy Dolphins in the Mekong River.

We did so without high expectations having received reports that there were less than half a dozen dolphins left in this particular stretch of the river. We duly set out in 4 boats (6 viewing chairs on each) and after some 15/20 minutes arrived at a spot where the engines were cut off and we floated hoping to see some of the dolphins.

Ideal for Tour Groups.,"Together with 25 Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself are nearing the end of a short (2 night) stay at the Pakse Hotel which is nearly 60 years old but underwent extensive redecoration in 2003.

Medium-sized property (63 rooms) that is well located and offers good value for money. Once we had mastered our shower (unfortunately, not stand alone), we were certainly pleased with our room - particularly, the large comfortable bed. Ditto with the buffet-style Breakfast (supplemented by an excellent egg station) at the ground floor ‘Le Patiok de Noy’ restaurant and the same applied to the Group Dinner we had on the 7th Floor Panorama Restaurant which offers great views of the town.

Service was also good with most staff more than willing to help in any way they could. A real bonus was the fact that the Hotel’s laundry charges are based on weight (40,000 Kipp - US$5 approx per kilo) rather than per item which can - depending on one’s needs - offer significant savings.

All in all, our stay has been a most enjoyable one and it certainly came as no surprise to find out that several other Tourist Groups were also staying at the Hotel.",February 2020,Pakse Hotel & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g670161-d940586-Reviews-Pakse_Hotel_Restaurant-Pakse_Champasak_Province.html,"Pakse, Laos",hotels,5.0,4.0
Late Departure but excellent in-flight service.,"It had been many years since either my wife and myself had travelled on Qantas and things didn’t get off to a good start in Sydney when there were 3 delays in our boarding time.

However, once we had boarded the business class seats were much to our liking. As indeed was the in-flight service - some of the best I have experienced for some time and I fly a lot - and the quality of the meals.

We also managed to get 4/5 hours sleep on the flight and much of this was due to the comfortable flat bed. Added to which - and despite the late departure from Sydney - our arrival in Bangkok was only 10 minutes later than expected.

All in all, this was a most enjoyable flight and both of us would be more than happy to repeat the experience.",February 2020,Qatar Airways,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729134-Reviews-Qatar-Airways,World,flights,4.0,4.0
Excellent Budget Airline,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself travelled to Buri Ram on Nok Air from Don Mueang Airport.

This was our first experience of Nok Air and it had also been many years since we had been to Don Mueang. Both were well above expectations with Don Mueang being very much on a par with Suvernabhumi Airport and Nok Air were most professional both on the ground and in the air.

Our short flight departed and landed on schedule and I would certainly have no reservations about using them again or recommending others to do so.",February 2020,Nok Air,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729124-Reviews-Nok-Air,World,flights,4.0,3.5
"Rubbish, Rubbish, Rubbish Everywhere!!","Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself visited Wat Phou Temple - a UNESCO World Heritage Site (listed in 2002) some 40/50 Kms away from Pakse where we are staying at the Pakse Hotel (Review to follow).

We were both very much looking forward to the visit but, unfortunately, our visit took place the morning after a 4 day (5-8 February) World Heritage Festival and the whole site was covered in litter and rubbish (mainly plastic bags and bottles). This completely ruined our visit and my strong recommendation to the Authorities is to close the site for several days after any further such Festivals to avoid foreign visitors seeing one of their relatively few UNESCO World Heritage sites resembling a rubbish tip!!

That said, half of our group (the more able bodied - as the 70-80 steps to the principle site are very steep) still visited the many interesting artefacts/relics but even this was spoiled by smoke from a nearby fire!!

All in all, not a completely wasted visit (ie we did manage to tour the impressive Museum) but certainly one that offered much room for improvement!!",February 2020,Wat Phu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1015988-d2011694-Reviews-Wat_Phu-Champasak_Town_Champasak_Province.html,"Champasak Town, Laos",attractions,1.0,4.5
Local Eatery on the banks of the Mekong River.,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself had lunch today at the Dokchampa Restaurant which is part of Dokchampa Guesthouse.

It is a large property - overlooking the Mekong River - but we were the only guests having lunch. No matter, both the service and the food (I particularly liked the Mekong Fish dishes) were good and - as such - I would have no difficulties paying a return visit.",February 2020,Dokchampa Guesthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1510725-d6879104-Reviews-Dokchampa_Guesthouse-Don_Khone_Champasak_Province.html,"Don Khone, Laos",hotels,4.0,4.5
Good Group Venue,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself had lunch today at Xuan Mai Restaurant just 50 metres away from where we are staying at the Pakse Hotel (Review to follow).

It is a relatively small property and we were allocated one of the inside rooms for our exclusive use. The food (six or seven different dishes - including Lao Sausage which was a little spicy but delicious) was all of high quality and well received by the Group as a whole.

The only minor criticism was that the service could have been a little speedier but - to be fair - I suspect they don’t have such large groups to cater for every day!",February 2020,Xuan Mai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g670161-d3600015-Reviews-Xuan_Mai-Pakse_Champasak_Province.html,"Pakse, Laos",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Highly Recommended,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Pakse staying at the Pakse Hotel (Review to follow) and - on asking where was the best place to go for a massage - we were literally directly across the street to Dok Champha Massage.

We duly did so and booked afternoon appointments for which we were most grateful as on our return the place was not only fully booked but actually turned away half a dozen or so clients whilst we were having our one hour foot/leg messages which at Kip70,000 (US$7 approx) was excellent value for money.

As for the massages themselves, they were both very good - so good in fact we have booked repeat ones for tomorrow! We would certainly recommend Dok Champa to others and - based on experience - they won’t be disappointed!!",February 2020,Dok Champa Massage,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g670161-d7395688-Reviews-Dok_Champa_Massage-Pakse_Champasak_Province.html,"Pakse, Laos",attractions,5.0,4.5
Lovely Colonial-style property on the banks of the Mekong River.,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members my wife and myself are nearing the end of a brief (overnight) stay at the Tohsang Khongjiam Resort & Spa on the banks of the Mekong River - close to the Laos Border which our Group will be crossing later today.

It is an older, Colonial-style property with extensive gardens including a lovely swimming pool, Spa (which we didn’t use) and internal and external dining areas - the latter being ideal (with not a single mosquito in sight!) at this time of the year. It really is delightful to wake up to a lovely view of the Mekong on your doorstep - or in our case Balcony!

The downside is the age of the property means that not all the amenities are at the top of their game (ie I struggled to get any hot water to shave this morning) but this is more than compensated by the excellent staff and the high quality of food (much of which is freshly prepared) at both restaurants.

All in all, a most enjoyable stay - albeit a rather brief one!",February 2020,Tohsang Khongjiam Resort and Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2093545-d621702-Reviews-Tohsang_Khongjiam_Resort_and_Spa-Khong_Chiam_Ubon_Ratchathani_Province.html,"Khong Chiam, Thailand",hotels,4.0,4.0
Interesting Site but spoiled by local Fair!,"Together with 25 other Anglo-Thai Society members, my wife and myself paid a short earlier today to Prasat Wat Kamphaeng Yai.

From the outside, this looked a very interesting site but it soon became clear (by the very loud noise levels) that a local Fair/Festival was in full swing. Unfortunately, this took the gloss of what would otherwise have been a much more enjoyable visit.

Nonetheless, there were still no shortage of interesting artefacts/relics/statues to see but we were back on the road much sooner than otherwise have been the case!!",February 2020,Prasat Wat Sa Kamphaeng Yai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2237577-d4322899-Reviews-Prasat_Wat_Sa_Kamphaeng_Yai-Uthumphon_Phisai_Sisaket_Province.html,"Uthumphon Phisai, Thailand",attractions,3.0,4.0
