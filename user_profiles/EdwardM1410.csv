A day later I realized that the attendant or parker of the car and stolen dollar bills I had in my visor carrier and all of the coinage in my seat side carrier. Amount is not the issue since it was less than $20 dollars but beware, do not leave any money or change in the car. It will not be there when you get back.

Buffets in RI,The place is out of the way and off the main street. The food is brought out constantly because there is not a large amount of each item on display. This is a good thing since I would assume it is fresh and not been lying around for a while. The fried items seemed to be over done and the food is relatively bland. The best item I found was the Prime Rib which was medium rare and quite tasty and tender. The steam tables kept most items just warm and not really hot. The prime rib is served only on weekends and at a price of $13.99 per person would make it a bargain just to have that and whatever sides with it. Place has a full bar and stocked quite well including polynesion drinks available. Has sushi items and Chinese food items as well as spagetti and soups and even clam cakes. I would not highly recommend but it still is a good bargain once in a while.,March 2019,Bristol Buffet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54063-d10544787-Reviews-Bristol_Buffet-Bristol_Rhode_Island.html,"Bristol, Rhode Island",restaurants,3.0,4.5

They said because I had stopover in Toronto that it was considered domestic. That was surprise to me since the domestic counter was way over to the extreme end of the terminal. At least the girl that told me what to do walked us all the way over to the other counter to make sure I knew where I had to go. That was very good service.
