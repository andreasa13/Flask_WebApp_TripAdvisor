Good first experience,"Being our first ever snorkelling experience, it was safe to try in a peaceful less crowded bay. Dan was friendly, flexible and goes the extra mile when situation demands it.

Location,"Located 1 km from syntagma metro / x95 which will drop u in syntagma when coming in from the airport, is situated round the corner to Hadrian’s arch with several restaurants near by. Taxis are plenty and the national park is near by too. The akropolis is less than half a kilometre away hence a central location but not too touristy.
The hotel ambiance is good , reception staff friendly to the correct amount and same old breakfast every day. Our room had balcony looking onto the outdoor pool , with a nice bathroom, CNN / BBC Television and good air con.

Breakfast is served on level 7 on the rooftop offering great views of the Acropolis and Athens, which was impressive.Did not try the bar but room service is good with polite staff.

Aegina,"There were several expensive options available to visit this island as part of 3 island hopper at 100 euros , private small cruises at 130. £ with swimming stops etc. We did the 8€ each way boat trip from Piraeus and visited the monastery and Aphaia temple , both of which took 10 minutes each ; with proper awareness of boat timings the island can be visited in all under 4 -5 hours: There are also the marina if one wants to swim / sun bathe or visit other smaller islands such as Agistri and Moni reachable through separate boats. I guess it all depends on what one wants to do in these trips, while swimming , island hopping or history/ pilgrimage etc.
Buses are infrequent,in Aegina , simply hire a taxi , and be done with it in 40 minutes if time is tight.There are several shops tempting with sampling pistachios which are okay , too salty , and not at all the overated hype ,just slightly better than the usual supermarket ones we get in UK.

Old habits die hard,"Visited this temple for the first time last week with elderly parent and a small child.
My experience : Poor guidance from temple employees about where to find the free darshan entrance.We were asked to go through the whole loop of queuing area even though there were hardly anybody ,approximately 10 people
2) When asked to accept the Saree and perform archana for the deity ,the priest were very rude asking me to Ho back and get the coconuts broken before entering the sanctum Santorum or moolavar.
3) All the while the priest kept muttering abuse how people don't know the procedures....
The Saree was finally taken and draped on the mahameru.As I said even though there were less than 10 devotees we were ushered out in seconds.I came round twice to get proper and satisfactory darshan of Ambal .
If you are like me living in virtual reality it was a wake up call as to the prevalence of caste discrimination in front of parabrahmam ,in this day and age.I can see why Dravidian movement is still active in Tamilnadu and can also see how it took root.
