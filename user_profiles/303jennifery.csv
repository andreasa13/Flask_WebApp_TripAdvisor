Highly impressed,"This museum is incredible. Plan to spend 3+ hours wandering. Sculptures, pottery, tools and more from all eras. It’s a perfect thing to do in the afternoon as it’s air conditioned and there is so much to see. It’s also a very good thing to do before going to the Acropolis to have perspective and in my humble opinion, beats the Acropolis in experience. What a gem and only €10 vs €20 at the Acropolis. This was a highlight of my trip to Athens and also a strong reminder of how much there is to know about our human history.",September 2018,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Vacation in Greece,Highly recommended to buy your ticket ahead of time and to go either first thing in the morning or later in the day to avoid crowds. I also recommend going to the Archaeological Museum before to give some context.,September 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Disappointed,"I came here based on the positive reviews and was very disappointed. I don’t like leaving negative reviews but I just couldn’t take a bite. It was very oily and not what I was hoping to have my last night in Athens. The server was very nice and I just paid my bill and left quietly without saying anything. It may just not be my style of food but thought I’d share for travelers to know this is the style of cuisine. Again, it may just be me. :(",September 2018,Atlantikos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7176555-Reviews-Atlantikos-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Amazing experience,"This was my first time at a Turkish bath and it was fantastic. They have 3 levels of experience, all very affordable. Note they do not accept international credit cards so be prepared to pay cash. I paid for the highest and loved my experience. Everything was professional and clean, with sensitivity to any concern of level of dress and/or being in the same room with the opposite sex. Highly recommend!",September 2018,Bitez Hamam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298658-d10315894-Reviews-Bitez_Hamam-Bodrum_City_Bodrum_District_Mugla_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Bodrum City, Turkey",attractions,5.0,5.0
Beautiful oasis!,"Love love love this place! It’s the perfect spot in the middle of Bodrum- it is clean, quiet and just lovely. The owner is very knowledgeable about the area and very nice. The courtyard is beautiful and you don’t want to leave! Breakfast is very nice, good coffee and they somehow are always playing perfect music. They offer excellent wine that is affordable. Will always stay here on return visits! One of my favorite places I’ve ever stayed.",September 2018,Su Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298658-d295789-Reviews-Su_Hotel-Bodrum_City_Bodrum_District_Mugla_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Bodrum City, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5
Fantastic SUP Experience,JC is the perfect SUP instructor! He and his SUP dog Bailey showed me the ropes and made me feel super comfortable as a female traveling solo and being new to paddle boarding. We saw some incredible views and also enjoyed some local hot springs which were lovely after a long day. Thank you JC for such a unique experience and for all of your hospitality. I’ll definitely be back and highly recommend the Panasurf experience to anyone.,August 2018,guateSUP,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g292008-d8651101-Reviews-GuateSUP-Panajachel_Lake_Atitlan_Solola_Department_Western_Highlands.html,"Panajachel, Guatemala",attractions,5.0,5.0
