Awesome sight!,My three friends and I had a private tour guide arranged by our taxi service. Great move on our part! So much better than in a big group. She gave great insight into the history of Acropolis and other surrounding ruins. So well preserved thanks to the many people that have working to keep it that way.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
More than a taxi service!,"TripAdvisor reviews are accurate! George's Taxi was great. Our driver, Stratos, was great! He was on time picking us up. The car was clean and comfortable to hold four people. He was knowledgeable and got us to the Acropolis for our guided tour at the time expected. George's Taxi arranged for us to have a guide. Don't tour without one. She was an excellent tour guide. Stratos had everything under the sun in the trunk of his car. Need an umbrella, water, paper towel, he had it. He recommended that we go to the museum as it rained later in the day. So glad we took his advice. So much to see in Athens and he took us to all the important places. Although he is not a guide, his knowledge qualified him in my book. Thank you, George's Taxi, for a wonderful, insightful day in Athens!",October 2019,George's Taxi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1905851-Reviews-George_s_Taxi-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
