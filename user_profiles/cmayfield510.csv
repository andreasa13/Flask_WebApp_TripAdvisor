"Incredibly relaxing, and stress relieving!","My wife booked this as a treat for our 20th wedding anniversary, and I had no idea what to expect. I was absolutely blown away by the experience, and I will say that we will come to AIRE every time we visit Copenhagen. There are several different types of pools, all based on water temperature and experience, from a sauna, hot water pool, medium water temperature pool, absolutely cold temperature pool, a pool with jets, a pool with rocks on the bottom to walk through, absolutely refreshing and relaxing. To top it off, we had a 1 hour massage. This was an awesome 2.5 hours and one we will be repeating!",May 2021,AIRE Ancient Baths Copenhagen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189541-d21232400-Reviews-AIRE_Ancient_Baths_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",attractions,5.0,4.0
This place continues to impress!,"We had been here a few times before the COVID shutdown and were excited to be able to come back when the government allowed restaurants to be opened again. We live just a few hours away by train, so this was the first place we wanted to go when it was allowed. Our waiter actually remembered us and even the things we ordered the last time we were there. I will say that the food here is some of the best food we've ever eaten, and we have had just about everything on the menu. The same level of service and quality of food is back from before and it's lovely. The cocktail menu is also outstanding.

Peaceful in the heart of the city,"We stayed in a superior deluxe room with a private balcony. It allowed us to enjoy the weather while relaxing privately. The room was clean, the shower was very nice with plenty of hot water. We enjoyed the sitting area with the couch and chair as well. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful with getting us taxis and answering questions. The hotel is very central to the Kobenhavn H train station as well.

Enjoyable! Good service and food,"We happened to be staying in the hotel and decided to give this restaurant a try, and we were not disappointed. The food and service were great. We started with a chef's choice of anitpasti, and for the main course my wife had a nice tagliatele with beef tenderloin, and I had the lasagna. To finish we shared a tiramisu. The wine selection was good as well, mainly focusing on the Italian wines. Our waiter was very attentive and came back to check on us often.

The food is excellent, and the service was even better. We enjoyed each course, but the best for me was the main course (I chose the chicken, my wife chose the fish).

Enjoyable day at Tivoli,"I’ll be honest that I didn’t have high expectations before going here, but I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised at the park. The grounds are tastefully done and the rides are better than I thought they would be. The food selection is definitely better than you usually see at an amusement park as well.

The Two Seas - Northernmost point of Denmark,"Very Interesting and worth while to visit. Seeing the two seas physically come together is impressive. Be sure to check the weather before going and be prepared. It was windy and a little rainy during our time there. The currents don't really allow for swimming very well, and the water was cold anyway. The time spent there was very pleasant. You can take the transport there from the parking lot to the drop off point for a 20 DKK fee per person if you feel like walking, but that's part of the attraction.

Nice place to visit with younger children,"Legoland is a nice experience, really set up well for young children. However, I'd say the maximum age this park is good for is around 12, as they base the attractions for the younger ages (probably rightfully so). The miniature cities and attractions of Europe are a nice touch. If you want to eat a sit down type of meal, be prepared to wait as they are not set up for long lines of people.

The menu was very good, and has an English printed one as well, if you ask. We had the schnitzel, which was very good. The wine list was not large but had good options (Riesling and Spanish red is what we chose). The service was very good as well, so overall a pleasant experience.",November 2019,Vertigo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187411-d2454330-Reviews-Vertigo-Flensburg_Schleswig_Holstein.html,"Flensburg, Germany",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Nice Location, average food.","We stayed across the street, and ate at Cafe Razz. The atmosphere is excellent as the location is great (by the water). This place is usually always busy, especially when the weather is nice. The food itself is regular pub food if you would describe it. The staff and service are not very good, so take that into account. The location and liveliness of the area is what draws you to this place.",July 2019,Cafe Razz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189522-d2221686-Reviews-Cafe_Razz-Middelfart_Funen_and_Islands.html,"Middelfart, Denmark",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Nice little getaway in Middelfart,"My family and I stayed here for a month in July and really enjoyed it. The big french windows with a view of the water was outstanding and very relaxing. The area around the hotel is lively due to the Cafe Razz across the street. There is no staff on duty, all is done via envelopes, key cards and e-mail. We found the owner to be very nice and accommodating to all our needs. There is a private garage available for use at an extra fee as well. I would recommend this place highly.",July 2019,Hotel Borgmestergaarden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189522-d1595312-Reviews-Hotel_Borgmestergaarden-Middelfart_Funen_and_Islands.html,"Middelfart, Denmark",hotels,4.0,4.0
Castle and Grounds - Nice!,This was an unexpected little slice of the country in Copenhagen. I enjoyed this visit more than the Amalienborg Palace as the gardens attached to this castle are very nice indeed. The public seems to agree as there were a lot more visitors to this castle than Amalienborg (short walk away).,November 2019,Rosenborg Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189541-d197741-Reviews-Rosenborg_Castle-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice Ceremony - Love the Danish flavor,"Having seen this at other locations throughout Europe, it was nice to get a Danish view of this, and it did not disappoint. Please stop by and see this if you are in Copenhagen. It's very accessible, and the crowds are not massive as they are in London.",November 2019,Changing of her Majesty's guard at Amalienborg Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189541-d4606443-Reviews-Changing_of_her_Majesty_s_guard_at_Amalienborg_Castle-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",attractions,4.0,4.0
Hotel itself not so bad....location and atmosphere not so good,"We thought this would be ok to stay a for a few hours before catching a bus trip back to Denmark. The location is not the best (close to the train station/bus station), but its ok. The nature of the hotel itself tends to lend itself to a younger crowd, and not conducive to a good night's rest. The noise outside on the street is such that you cannot open a window, so bring earplugs to block the noise. The building that we stayed in is not close to the building where you check in, so be advised of that. I would not recommend if you are a traveling family. If you are young and single and more used to the hostel lifestyle then maybe this place is for you.",October 2019,Sleephotels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187331-d10807977-Reviews-Sleephotels-Hamburg.html,"Hamburg, Germany",hotels,2.0,3.0
"Cave of Zeus....long walk uphill, so be prepared","This was a must see place for my 17 year old, so we lined it up. The walk up to the cave itself is quite a hike uphill, so be prepared and bring water. Once in the cave, it is a haul to get down to the bottom and back up, so take it at your own pace. Overall, not sure what connects this cave to Zeus, but it was a good experience and nice to get some exercise in nature.",October 2019,Cave of Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g7715552-d7737540-Reviews-Cave_of_Zeus-Plati_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0
Nice steakhouse in Crete,"Pretty good steakhouse by European standards. We were looking for a little taste of home after our European travels, so this suited us well. Stay with the tried and true cuts of beef and you'll be ok. The atmosphere was excellent, with nice sea views, and breeze off the water. Overall an enjoyable evening.",October 2019,The Butcher's Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503710-d12556656-Reviews-The_Butcher_s_Bar-Hersonissos_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Love this place!,"We stayed at a hotel close by for 3 nights and went to eat here twice during our stay. The service, hospitality, and food are excellent. I highly recommend going here to eat and enjoy the view as well. This is what I think of when I think of a nice, family-oriented Greek restaurant.",October 2019,Argo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503710-d3222768-Reviews-Argo-Hersonissos_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
How old is this place?,The shear age of this place is fascinating....thinking about how long ago this place was built and inhabited is incredible. This may be the oldest civilization in Europe if estimates are correct. The self-paced tour was our choice so we got to walk around at our own leisure. I would highly recommend going to this place if you have time on Crete.,October 2019,The Palace of Knossos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g13124727-d195896-Reviews-The_Palace_of_Knossos-Knosos_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great location and price,"We stayed here for a weekend in Copenhagen and would recommend it. The reason we chose it is its central location and great price. The rooms are 4 bunk beds and can be rented by the bed instead of the room, so take this into account if you want something private. Towels are extra if you don't bring your own.",November 2019,Generator Copenhagen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189541-d2153100-Reviews-Generator_Copenhagen-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",hotels,3.0,4.0
"Very affordable, great view and beach access","My family and I staying here on vacation in October of this year and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had a great view of the beach and a nice balcony to enjoy a glass of wine with. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and readily available downstairs at the jewelry shop. The area around the hotel is nice as well, with plenty of food, nightlife and shopping. We will be back here in the future.",October 2019,Villa Sonia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g503710-d1109198-Reviews-Villa_Sonia-Hersonissos_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
