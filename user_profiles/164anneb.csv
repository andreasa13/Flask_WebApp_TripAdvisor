Wonderful 2 night stay,"We stayed in Room 7, I think, overlooking the back yard of the property. Quiet, very comfortable, attractively furnished. Excellent breakfast choices. Staff was helpful and friendly, especially the ladies in the downstairs kitchen.

Do pay attention to ticks as recommended by the staff! I collected three on me within the first few hours after a walk in the fields across the little stream.",July 2019,Olema House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32820-d73894-Reviews-Olema_House-Olema_Marin_County_California.html,"Olema, California",hotels,5.0,4.0
Our home in Athens,"We were thrilled with our selection of Noble Suites for our recent visit to Athens. Perfectly located and beautifully appointed, we hit the jackpot with this hotel. Marianna and Milena cannot be more accommodating, helping with restaurant suggestions, airport transfers, and a fantastic local driver, Alex. This small hotel is ideally situated in a quiet neighborhood about a 10 minute walk to the Acropolis. Breakfast choices are almost too numerous to manage. The decor, the service, the location all live up to the aptly named Noble Suites.

Excellent collection,"Fantastic collection of ancient artifacts. Well done interpretative panels in English. This museum was especially informative after visiting ancient Greek sites on Santorini: Akritori and Thera. Allow enough time to immerse yourselves, at least 2 hours.",August 2018,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Over the top,"Of course you will visit the Acropolis, it is a must, and it more than lives up to it's reputation. Definitely make the effort to arrive when it opens at 8, beating the crowds and the heat. We nearly had the place to ourselves at 8:15 am. Simply marvelous!! We spent a little over two hours walking around and reading informative panels and our guide book (Rick Steves, of course).

We purchased the combo ticket for 30 Euors, well worth it if you are interested in seeing at least three of the six or so sites included. You can buy it ant any of the included sites and it is good for several days. The ticket will be scanned at each site. Note that the ticket does not cover the Acropolis museum.",August 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent museum,"We toured the Acropolis Museum before visiting the actual Acropolis. This was perfect for our group as we learned a lot about what we would see on the actual site. Take time to read the many informative panels or follow along with your Rick Steves guidebook as we did. Be sure to watch the two video presentations on the upper floor, one about the Parthenon and the other about the many, many relics that have been carted off to other museums. The café has great food and is a nice place to refuel after all of the learning.

If possible, buy your tickets in advance. The entrance line was long and slow. We spent a couple hours in this museum.",August 2018,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great airport hotel,"We stayed here on our last night in Athens. The airport is about a 3 minute walk across the street, perfect for early flights. The hotel staff is very accommodating and pleasant and there is a nice restaurant which seems to be open at all hours. The rooms are large and comfortable and quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel for an airport stay.",August 2018,Sofitel Athens Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562627-d285733-Reviews-Sofitel_Athens_Airport-Spata_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Spata, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
One lovely night,"Sadly, we were only able to stay one night at the Three Tree Point Bed and Breakfast. This small B and B is sophisticated from top to bottom, including the DIY breakfast options. Owner Penny is friendly, easy going and flexible, and very knowledgeable about the area. The view of Puget Sound is a wonderful addition to this quiet, luxurious spot.

Nice choice for a Vancouver holiday,"Great rooms, great breakfast, great staff, all great. Nice to have the extras of an in-room kitchen even though a full breakfast is included every day.

Their house is your house: La loro casa è la tua casa!,"You know how you read a lot of superlative reviews on Trip Advisor... and you wonder, hmmmmm, could it really be that good? Could the owners really be that nice, helpful, thoughtful, capable, kind, friendly, and fun? And the dog? Really, is the dog really so cute and lovable, providing just the right amount of dog interaction for pet owners on holiday? And the view? the rooms? the food? even the other guests? Could they really be as good as those other people said? Well, in the case of Antica Olivaia and Daniela and Marco and Miles, the answers are Yes, Yes, Yes! I'm not going to write on and on about the farmhouse, the surrounding countryside, the olive groves, the great view of and proximity to Orvieto, the knowledge of Daniela and Marco about anything and everything, because there's no need. Just take my word for it...and the words of all of the other very satisfied visitors: Antica Olivaia is wonderful: magnifico! I'm only sorry that once the rest of the world finds out...we won't be able to get another reservation!!",October 2013,Antica Olivaia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g194843-d1443161-Reviews-Antica_Olivaia-Orvieto_Province_of_Terni_Umbria.html,"Orvieto, Italy",hotels,5.0,5.0
