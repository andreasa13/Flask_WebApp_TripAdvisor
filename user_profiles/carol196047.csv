Go carefu!,We went to the acropolis and chose not to clamber up the steps so chose to view Athens in its hugeness and marvel at the acropolis. Unfortunately just as I was taking the all important panoramic view the batteries have put on my camera. Not wanting to lose the opportunity i downgraded to my phone after putting my camera into our trip bag.....yep we had it nicked!!! So just a warning to take extra care of all things when visiting the sights in Athens..,March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,1.0,4.5
