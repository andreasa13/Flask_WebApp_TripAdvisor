"Busy bar, decent food, good live music and atmosphere.","It’s a busy bar, it was really busy on a quiet Wednesday night, which can’t be a bad sign. Drinks were fine and good prices. Bar food, wings, burger, club sandwich all fine. Barman was friendly and chatty. Live music was on which created a great atmosphere, lots of people enjoying themselves, so we stayed longer. A great night.

That’s how we saw it anyway.",December 2019,Dubliner Irish Pub and Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274924-d740031-Reviews-Dubliner_Irish_Pub_and_Restaurant-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Great restaurant,"Very nice setting, varied and different menu with lots of choice. All the dishes were very well cooked and presented. Tasty and delicious and good value. We ordered risotto and were pleased it didn’t appear within a few minutes as it takes time to cook, these looked freshly prepared. Nice friendly waiter and waitress.",December 2019,Le Papillon Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274924-d10734922-Reviews-Le_Papillon_Restaurant-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Really nice restaurant,"Really nice restaurant with good food, good value prices, nice menu choice, friendly staff and a guy quietly playing piano as background music.

Nice castle for a view,"Nice views, good walk up and around. Looks good, museum inside perhaps only average and not sure it’s worth the admission, other than the chapel / church inside which is stunning.",December 2019,Bratislava Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274924-d276280-Reviews-Bratislava_Castle-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",attractions,3.0,4.0
"Very nice lunch, traditional","Very nice lunch, traditional menu, good size portions. Very good value. Food a little slow to come but very nice when it arrived. When we got to the restaurant there was a queue waiting to be seated and they tried to move people to their other bar and restaurant alongside/below. That’s fine but it was more bar meals and snacks and didn’t have the same menu. So a bit annoyingly we had to go back up and queue again. Would still recommend, hearty food at very good price.",December 2019,Bratislava Flag Ship Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274924-d2202820-Reviews-Bratislava_Flag_Ship_Restaurant-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
A class above,"Similar menu at first glance to many other local restaurants. But much better quality, slightly different dishes, a few twists. Very good food. Excellent service. Friendly and helpful.

Nicely different with excellent food,"In amongst a lot of touristy places offering very similar traditional menus this was like a breath of fresh air.

Amazing fish dishes. Wonderful presentation and flavours. A very high quality and worth a few € extra overall. Staff were very friendly and helpful, happy to explain and suggest from the menu and specials.

Really terrific place.",September 2019,BlueFish Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d13568534-Reviews-BlueFish_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wonderful history,"Take a tour and learn more. Amazing history, amazing views. Such old and ancient content. It was busy but not overwhelmingly so on a Monday a.m. at the end of September. Take your time getting to the top, look and see what’s on the way, makes the walk up much easier.",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Absolutely stunning,"Superb food, attentive and very friendly staff. Beautiful English explanations of each course were very much appreciated. The 5 course tasting menu was excellent and nicely varied.

"Very nice for a special,occasion","Always wanted to eat there and eventually booked a table. Will definitely go back again. Regularly updated menus, very fresh food, excellently cooked and presented. Full of flavour and taste, would recommend highly. Excellent value too for fine dining.

All the servers were extremely attentive, friendly and well informed. They took care of us very well indeed.",March 2019,Restaurant 22,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186225-d697999-Reviews-Restaurant_22-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Average Sunday lunch,"Nice enough setting. Average food. Roast beef at the dear end of the Sunday lunch scale and was two small almost wafer thin slices of well cooked beef. Tasty enough but little of it. Veg with roast also distinctly average. I’d not cook broccoli when it’s going yellow/brown myself and didn’t expect to be served it.

Some of the other food looked ok, but again just average.

Place was reasonably busy, service was ok.",March 2019,Banyers House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1069784-d11825986-Reviews-Banyers_House-Royston_Hertfordshire_England.html,"Royston, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Small but excellent tour,"Very informative. Small setting makes for a nice easy tour round but it’s more about the information, the very friendly guide and the tastings at the end. Learned a lot, loved it all, great to try a few gins with the extra information provided for the tasting. Good to see how a small business has grown.",February 2019,Warner's Distillery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1649529-d6557391-Reviews-Warner_s_Distillery-Harrington_Northamptonshire_England.html,"Harrington, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,5.0
"Decent food, nice service","Very handy for food if visiting the distillery or staying at nearby B&B. Reasonably priced menu, with a smallish but adequate range of choice. Some specials evident, eg fish and chip shop night on a Friday. Main courses were a bit pub grub but ok. Nothing wrong with them but nothing to shout out about. Prices about average. A decent meal overall. Young staff made you feel very welcome and ran a friendly service.",February 2019,Tollemache Arms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1649529-d3396572-Reviews-Tollemache_Arms-Harrington_Northamptonshire_England.html,"Harrington, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Very good stay,"Nice, clean room. Made very welcome. Comfortable bed. Well equipped and tea, coffee, hot chocolate available to make in room. Quiet farm location, but very handy for pub and nearby gin tour in easy walking distance. Great fresh breakfast included, coffee cafetières were very welcome and something more places should offer. Would recommend.",February 2019,Church Farm Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1649529-d1111657-Reviews-Church_Farm_Lodge-Harrington_Northamptonshire_England.html,"Harrington, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
A big like,"If we’d found this as a tapas bar in Seville we’d have been happy and thought it was a good fit locally. Small range of fairly traditional tapas dishes following strong Spanish themes. Plenty of choice though and some specials. Value was pretty reasonable, dishes were nicely presented and well cooked. Portions about right from small tapas.

Atmosphere was of a busy bar, Spanish speaking staff added to the atmosphere, as did some Spanish music in background, occasionally a bit loud, but blended in most of the time. Service always with a smile too.",February 2019,Tabanco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186225-d13792240-Reviews-Tabanco-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Good meal, friendly service","Visited after the cinema on a Saturday night without booking. Had a short wait to get a table but not a problem. Decent choices on menu, good range of dishes available with plenty of variations, add ons etc. Prices seemed reasonable, watch out for vouchers online to help further.

Tasty food, nicely cooked, as described on the menu. Attentive service, friendly and helpful.",January 2019,Chiquito,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g209939-d5027075-Reviews-Chiquito-Huntingdon_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Huntingdon, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5

Meat quick pasta place,"Lots of sauces, lots of pasta types. Choose and let’s them cook it for you while you wait. Nice and fresh, grab a seat at a table and that’s lunch sorted. Plenty of choices, fast fresh food, reasonably healthy options, drinks etc available. We all liked what we had and the prices were very reasonable, choice of large or small servings, small was pretty big!",December 2018,Pasta Deli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d2676289-Reviews-Pasta_Deli-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good hotel and location,"Nice clean hotel. Modern and functional rather than luxury but comfortable and practical. Room was a decent size, some, not ours, had a rather odd look with the shower cubicle in the room rather than in a separate bathroom. I guess you’d get used to it!

Bathroom was clean and good shower and deep bath. Plenty of hot water. Plenty of clothes space, working safe and WiFi. Nespresso style coffee machine too.

Reviews say breakfast is dear. It’s not really, relatively standard price for a typical hotel buffet breakfast. They had a very good range of breakfast options, quality all good. And decent coffee too. If you just want a coffee and a croissant, you’ll get cheaper elsewhere, if you want more before you go out, this works well, and it’s a cheaper price per day if you book for more days.

Reception is fine, don’t get overexcited about the hotel bar, small and practical, but it’s there if you want a drink. Staff were nice, friendly, helpful, no complaints. In other hotels I see them being more enthusiastically and outwardly helpful, saying Hi when you come in, showing you a map and where’s best to go when you check in etc. We didn’t get that here, but I have no complaint at all, just an observation.

We had a comfortable nice safe stay in a great location. I’d recommend.",December 2018,Select Hotel Berlin Gendarmenmarkt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187323-d1230216-Reviews-Select_Hotel_Berlin_Gendarmenmarkt-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",hotels,4.0,4.0
