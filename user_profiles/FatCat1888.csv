Fresh & Vibrant,"Went to Dante’s with the family (2 adults, 3 teenagers) after a long days hiking - we’d built up an appetite! Dante’s didn’t disappoint. The food was superb - fresh, uncomplicated, tasty and plenty of it. Burgers are so good, the Inferno pizza will wake up every part of your body. But save room for the loaded fries!
Staff were attentive and friendly. The soundtrack was top quality and created a vibrant atmosphere. We will certainly be back.",October 2020,Dante’s Armagh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186474-d19876207-Reviews-Dante_s_Armagh-Armagh_County_Armagh_Northern_Ireland.html,"Armagh, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Above Average,"Good food, great staff, nice view from beer garden. Only down side is the limited menu before 5pm. We saw the online menu and this is why we chose here, but most of it wasn’t available before 5pm. Calamari chunks were great, pizza decent, but chicken and avocado sandwich was lackluster.",August 2020,Austies Pub & Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186635-d1937601-Reviews-Austies_Pub_Kitchen-Sligo_County_Sligo_Western_Ireland.html,"Sligo, Ireland",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Worth a visit,"Ate here with family of five (three teenagers). Overall the food was good, particularly the burgers and the Asian street food which was packed full of prawns and chicken. Chicken Alfredo was also a hit.
At €29 the steak was going to have to be really good, but it didn’t live up to the price tag. I’ve had better and much cheaper. Also we had tempura chicken and chicken strips as starters, while generous portions both tasted of fish - maybe fry the fish in a separate frier.
The staff and the scenery were lovely. COVID measures were excellent. It was also the best pint of Guinness I had in Sligo.

Don’t be the idiot,"Knocknarea is a beautiful way to spend a few hours. Go early to ensure a parking space and enjoy the walk up. It’s steep enough but manageable for both young and old. The cairn at the top, the legendary burial place of Queen Maebh, the bull thief is a sight to behold. A significant figure in Irish folklore, and an ancient tomb, it is clearly marked that it should not be climbed. However when we were there at least two separate people felt the need to ignore the signs and disrespect this cultural monument. The first person was a man in his forties who was doing an ultra-run challenge. He videos himself on top and became abusive with his faux Dublin south side accent to those who asked him to come down. The second was a woman in her late twenties, who decided to throw stones off the top! Both idiots. Plenty of teenagers on the top were dismayed at the two idiots and asked them to come down.
There a number of short paths on the top which are well worth exploring. They offer breathtaking views across Connacht and Ulster. Take your time and enjoy it, then treat yourself to an ice cream in Strandhill and look up to where you were - breathtaking. But don’t be the idiot!",August 2020,Knocknarea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186635-d216739-Reviews-Knocknarea-Sligo_County_Sligo_Western_Ireland.html,"Sligo, Ireland",attractions,5.0,5.0

Really Poor,"Our party of eight arrived after a ten kilometer hike. We were in good form and had worked up an appetite. We had originally planned to eat next door at Yiasemi which had good reviews, but we couldn’t get a table.
Despite not being very busy, we waited twenty minutes before being able to get the waiter to come near us. He seemed annoyed that we wanted to order a drink before food.
The food when it did come was poor in comparison to similar restaurants in the area. The mushroom risotto was cold and inedible, the calamari wasn’t much better. When this was pointed out to the waiter, he shrugged and took the dish away but did not bring an alternative or offer an apology or explanation.
When the mains arrived the waiter disappeared, no opportunity to order more drinks. As we left we looked to find someone to pay and complain to. Eventually we found an old man behind a till downstairs who was screaming abuse at the waiting staff.

Must see!,"We came across Tazza by chance. Disappointed not to get a table outside, we were shown inside. Mind blown! If you come, insist on sitting inside. The decor was amazing, the food above average and the staff very friendly.

Similar menu to most restaurants,"Similar menu to most restaurants in the area, however Gods’ stands out. The ingredients were fresh, prepared with passion and the staff were particularly friendly.

Exceptional,"Without doubt the best restaurant we ate in Athens.
Book in advance to ensure a rooftop table, the view is so breathtaking that you would be happy to eat gruel. But you won’t need to - the food was delicious. There were eight in our party, so we had a selection of appetizers and mains and lots of trying each other’s dishes. Onion pie, cheese pie and calamari were the favorite starters. Roast lamb, chicken fillet and beef sofrita were great mains. Milk tart and orange cake were the best desserts.

Should be better,"I’m not a Liverpool fan, but have great admiration for the club, its iconic status and its support. For me the tour didn’t reflect this far one simple reason - lack of personal touch. I’ve toured Celtic Park, Dortmund, San Mames in Bilbao, Camp Nou and many more. The best tours are those where you have a guide with passion, knowledge and insights that you cannot read in a book.
There were many great aspects to the tour, the main stand is fantastic, the fans singing and Klopp video are all good. But replace the headsets with limited information with real people. The guy who welcomed us and talked us through the do’s and don’ts was full of fun, passion and knowledge. Had he given the tour it would have been a much more complete experience.

Lunch,"Decent value for the two-course lunch. Meatball starter was a good portion size, but the sauce was a little too watery for my liking. For main I had burger which was above average. Kids had pizzas, full of flavor, however a bit soggy- cheese slid right off.
Great location and the decor was very nice. I imagine it would have a great atmosphere in the evening. Serving staff were very helpful and friendly.

The food in the restaurant was much better quality than I had expected and I would recommend it to both guests and locals.

Great grub.,"What is better than eating fish and chips? Eating fish and chips followed by a beautiful cake and served by warm, friendly staff.

Great Find,"After several days of eating at the beach front we tried Ty Breizh. Set one street back, this was a great find. The menu is limited to savory pancakes, salads, burgers and steak tartare.

"Nice walk, poor guide","The walk itself was quite nice, but nothing spectacular. Further up the Antrim coast or Donegal is much more scenic. The two mile walk isn’t as arduous as is made out on the website or safety talk - and that’s from an unfit, overweight 40+ person. I think the tour guides stretch it out to 2.5 hours to give the impression of value.
My main problem was the lack of cultural awareness of the guide. He repeatedly made comments that were offensive to Americans, Germans and once to French people. Some of his comments were homophobic and misogynistic. He also repeatedly talked about how ‘we are all Ulster Scots’ and gave a very dubious history lesson that made the Plantation of Ulster and the Highland Clearances seem like a cake sale. None of this related to the Gobbins itself and was totally unnecessary. To be fair to the guide he wasn’t meaning to be offensive, but there must be an onus on the management and public funders to ensure they are aware of the content of the guides information and also to provide cultural competency training.
Also the local council should remove all the loyalist and paramilitary flags from surrounding lampposts, that are designed to mark territory. If their purpose is to intimidate, it worked.",August 2018,The Gobbins,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2528878-d3398516-Reviews-The_Gobbins-Whitehead_County_Antrim_Northern_Ireland.html,"Whitehead, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5
Best part of Gobbins,"This is a great find. After several hours walking the Gobbins, there is no better way to recover than with a Rinka ice cream.

Fresh and tasty,"Stopped for a quick bite on way home from work. Good atmosphere, pleasant staff and a bit of craic in the bar.
Portions were generous, food was freshly made and full of flavor. The seafood linguine was simple, but delicious and notably better quality than the restaurants in the town. Well done.
We ate outside because it was such a warm evening, it would be great if they could put some tables in the sun at the back or across the road in the small park.",August 2018,Jack Quinn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g644237-d12872083-Reviews-Jack_Quinn-Trim_County_Meath.html,"Trim, Ireland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Disappointingly Average,"Having read all the positive reviews I was expecting something special but sadly this was not the case. There was nothing really bad about the place but it didn’t live up to the expectations.
Positives - nice setting, excellent attentive staff and my wife had the baked crusted cod which was very good.
My children had the burgers which they didn’t finish, which isn’t like them. Based on the waiter’s recommendation I had the ‘every popular’ chicken curry.
If you’re a certain age you will remember nightclubs in Ireland had to serve food at midnight Saturday night/Sunday morning. This was normally curry chips. I was immediately transported back in time. The curry tasted powdery and even a few button mushrooms and half a pepper couldn’t hide the lack of depth. Not offensive, but of similar standard as SuperMacs or McDonnells powder. The accompanying rice tasted of the local water, which isn’t pleasant. Obviously rice has to be cooked in water, but even a few cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon sticks or even salt may have lifted it.
I would go back, but will have the fish.",July 2018,The Grainne Uaile,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315881-d4414008-Reviews-The_Grainne_Uaile-Newport_County_Mayo_Western_Ireland.html,"Newport, Ireland",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Decent Pub Grub,"Staff were pleasant and helpful. Chicken goujon’s were excellent, as was the accompanying chili sauce. Bacon cheeseburger was good, but I wish rural Ireland would use smoky streaky bacon rather than rubbery rashers. They’re good for breakfast but not burgers. Highlight was the steak sandwich.

Worth second chance,"Attended tonight with family of five. Our server was very polite and attentive. Starters were very tasty, particularly the Italian sausage soup. However, there appeared to be an implosion in the kitchen, with orders backing up and nothing coming out bar desserts.
Our server apologized profusely to us and all the tables around us. Eventually food arrived and tasted great, with two exceptions. The lobster ravioli was poor and the scallop vodka linguine. First it came minus the scallops and secondly lacked sauce.
However, our server sorted this out and our other dishes were good. Following a discussion with the manager we got a decent discount off our bill.

Sporadic but Enjoyable,"My family and I used the riverwalk on a number of occasions while on vacation in Milwaukee.The section we walked was from Brady Street bridge to just past the bronze fonz. The negative was that it was not a continuous river walk. On several occasions we had to get up on to the street and through parking lots. It was also not clearly sign posted at sections. That said, we did it do on three mornings as when you were on the riverwalk it was beautiful, relaxing, clean and safe. Seeing some of the old breweries and warehouses was great. I would definitely recommend it to visitors to the city.

One word of caution - get there early or prepare to wait. As guests from Ireland we were up early and in the Tempo by 8am and were seated easily.

Little Gem,"This is a two star hotel so don't expect great facilities. What you do get though is great value for money, excellent location and extremely helpful staff.
The rooms are small, but clean and well presented. Ours had great sea views. A short walk of approximately five meters and you are on the beach. There is a great selection of cafes and restaurants within a few minutes walk. We preferred going one street back from the seafront as it was better quality food.
Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.
If management read this the only recommendation I would make is to try and reduce the noise from bedroom doors closing - maybe air cushioned stoppers.
We will definitely be back.",August 2016,Hotel Le Rivage,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g196664-d3369076-Reviews-Hotel_Le_Rivage-Chatelaillon_Plage_Charente_Maritime_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Chatelaillon-Plage, France",hotels,5.0,4.0
Just ok,"Ate here with family. Most of the food was quite good, though some dishes were average. There was a mix up in our order, with my wife only receiving her starter when we were half way through our main. The waiter apologised and it was no big deal as we had plenty to share. A really nice touch (which earned him a good tip) was that the waiter brought out blankets for us when the sun started to set.
Overall we enjoyed our evening, but a few minor improvements could have made it much better.",August 2016,Le Bugatti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g196664-d1515297-Reviews-Le_Bugatti-Chatelaillon_Plage_Charente_Maritime_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Chatelaillon-Plage, France",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Good for stopover,"A basic hotel but clean, tidy and a friendly staff/manager. Ideal edge of town hotel for stopping over and visiting the beautiful town. Rooms could do with being modernised. Important to book breakfast in advance as they only have enough food for pre-bookers.",July 2016,Au Relais Des Lilas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g651748-d6823335-Reviews-Au_Relais_Des_Lilas-Parthenay_Deux_Sevres_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Parthenay, France",hotels,3.0,3.0
Great Place,"I've been to Los Boliches several times and would normally stop here for a beer or an ice-cream for the kids on the way home from eating elsewhere. However this trip we ate here several times and were never disappointed.
It is noticeable that when we visited that it was the only place full every night. It was also full with local Spaniards and all the staff are Spanish. If you want an all-day breakfast go elsewhere. However if you want grilled Swordfish, lamb chops, half chickens or the best burger in Los Boliches this is the place for you.
It is more cafe than restaurant in decor, but when the tarpaulin is closed it has a great atmosphere and welcoming warmth. It also has much better food than most of the restaurants and that's why it's fool of local people when other places are empty.

The only negative is that all the staff are Real Madrid supporters (with the exception of the owner/boss/chef who supports Barca!).",May 2016,Cafeteria Mediterraneo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315915-d5901370-Reviews-Cafeteria_Mediterraneo-Fuengirola_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html,"Fuengirola, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good Value,"Good tasty food, reasonably priced with friendly staff. Well worth a visit. The menu should have something to accommodate everyone.

Great Indian,"This is undoubtedly the best Indian in Los Boliches. The food is very good, the staff were very welcoming.
The only negative is that I wish the portions were a bit bigger, but because the price is so reasonable I just ordered more!",May 2016,Indian Restaurant Balti & Curry House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315915-d4601515-Reviews-Indian_Restaurant_Balti_Curry_House-Fuengirola_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_A.html,"Fuengirola, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Superb,"This was without a doubt the best restaurant we visited in a week in Los Boliches. The food was superb, with our family of five clearing our plates on two separate occasions. I recommend the chicken and spinach.
The decor is more formal than most other beach from restaurants and they are to be commended for this. The staff were pleasant, efficient and helpful with menu choices. On our second visit we had the pleasure to be served by Dominique's father, who shared part of his fascinating life story with us.
I highly recommend Dominique's if you are looking for a bit more quality.",May 2016,Restaurante Dominique's Fuengirola,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315915-d1541812-Reviews-Restaurante_Dominique_s_Fuengirola-Fuengirola_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_An.html,"Fuengirola, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Well Worth A Visit,"Asadores came highly recommended and while I thoroughly enjoyed it, it didn't quite meet the recommendations. It is however still well worth a visit. I would put it in my top four Los Boliches restaurants. Good atmosphere, friendly staff and good food.
Try the prawn pil pil and steak - you won't be disappointed.",May 2016,Asadores Segovianos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315915-d2695457-Reviews-Asadores_Segovianos-Fuengirola_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html,"Fuengirola, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.5
A real gem,"First time to try Monto's and was a bit cautious as I'd read negative reviews about wait times and service. I shouldn't have worried! Family of five arrived hungry, place was busy but we were greeted and seated by a friendly waiter. We enjoyed generous helpings of fresh, tasty food. A good, varied Italian menu meant that there was something for everyone and the biggest problem was what to choose.
Between us we had steak, pizza, chicken and pasta mains. All of which were delicious.
We had three people eating two courses of the adult menu, two eating three courses of the children's menu, soft drinks and two coffees all for a very reasonable €70.
An added bonus is that you can bring your own wine - we will be back again without the children.
Well done to Monto's- good fresh food at affordable prices. More restaurants in the area could learn a thing from you!",March 2016,Monto's Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1390600-d6408084-Reviews-Monto_s_Restaurant-Kilmessan_County_Meath.html,"Kilmessan, Ireland",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Quality and value,"Family meal for two adults and three children. Good variety of food with several Malaysian dishes that set it aside from other Chinese restaurants. Everyone cleaned their plates. All of us had two courses, soft drinks, two coffees and one glass of wine for less than €80. Which is great value.
Had tried it for takeaway previously and thought it was average, but this sitting in experience was very positive and we will certainly be back.",December 2015,Wau Asian Cuisine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g644237-d2624908-Reviews-Wau_Asian_Cuisine-Trim_County_Meath.html,"Trim, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Decent hotel,"Stayed here for an overnight. Staff at reception, bar and restaurant were all very friendly and are a credit. Bedrooms were clean, tidy and average size for Ireland but the decor was a little dated. In the morning we noticed a lot of condensation on the window and black mould- need to sort out the ventilation. Restaurant food and service were very good but it lacked atmosphere- 8pm on Saturday night. Overall a pleasant stay with good staff, but nothing spectacular to note.",December 2015,Bracken Court Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g551502-d260171-Reviews-Bracken_Court_Hotel-Balbriggan_County_Dublin.html,"Balbriggan, Ireland",hotels,3.0,4.0
Lacks atmosphere,"Very attentive staff, good food, but lacked atmosphere due to lack of customers - we were there on a Saturday night and there were only a dozen people.",December 2015,Bracken Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551502-d4463239-Reviews-Bracken_Grill-Balbriggan_County_Dublin.html,"Balbriggan, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Super Sugar Supper Club,"Have eaten here twice in recent weeks - I think I will be back again!
Good food, staff and value.
The menu varies each week which is something I really like about the place, so there is always something new to try - last weeks lamb Wellington was exceptional! There is a good range of starters, mains and desserts that should suit all. The Italian lemon meringue was the definite winner at our table. The only negative food wise, is that one of our company order medium rare steak. Half the steak was medium, the other half was completely rare - as if half of it had been hanging outside the pan. However, staff fix it up without a fuss.
The staff are excellent. First impression would be that they are dressed a bit too casual - baggy black T-shirts and flared jeans. However, within seconds it is clear that they know customer service. They are warm, friendly, offer good advice, make sure they take note of special requests and most importantly they are clearly passionate about the eclectic menu. I can't praise them enough.
The three course menu is reasonably priced and good value. In addition you can bring your own wine which adds to the value (small corkage fee applies). The off licence across the road also gives a 10% discount if you mention you are going to the SSC.
The one downside is the lack of toilet facilities - one toilet shared by both male and female customers. It was spotlessly clean, but you may have to queue. If management could find a way to add another couple of loos it would be appreciated.
POI - you cannot book a table in advance, unless you are a member. It does get very busy at the weekends.",August 2015,14 Sugar Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g209938-d5324136-Reviews-14_Sugar_Island-Newry_County_Down_Northern_Ireland.html,"Newry, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Affordable fun,My three kids loved this attraction. The museum part takes about one hour and the three of them got to ride and operate the giant mechanical ant.
