"Lovely forest walk, spectacular panoramas from the top, and incredible history","Built by the Moors as a military fort in the 8th century, it acted as a control tower for the Atlantic coast and northern outposts from Lisbon. We entered the small, arched gate at the bottom of the hill and began our climb up a well-maintained path, through what looked like primeval forest, filled with tall trees, lots of greenery, and beautiful flowers. It was idyllic. Along the way we passed several archaeological sites—silos used by the Arabs (probably also by 5000 BC Neolithic people) for storing grain and ruins of Islamic houses. Muslim occupants of the castle settled near these ruins in 10th-12th centuries. Continuing on we passed the Church of San Pedro, built in the 12th century, following the reconquest of this area by King Alfonso Henriques in 1147. It was the first parish church of Sintra and was used for worship until the 14th century. It is now a museum containing artifacts and history of the castle. Further up the hill we passed through the arched gate in the towering wall. Once inside, we saw an ancient cistern and water trough in the small garden, then headed up the path to the castle keep. Standing on one of the highest hills, it is visible from the surrounding plains and the Atlantic and is the strategic center of the fortifications. We climbed to the very top of the tower and had magnificent panoramic views of the entire valley below and of the three major palaces which we had visited in Sintra: National Palace, Pena Palace, and Quinta da Regaleira. Spectacular phot ops! From the castle keep, we walked along the wall, from one tower to another, getting some great pictures along the way, and wandered through the lovely gardens before winding our way down the mountain to catch the bus back to Sintra.",June 2019,Castelo dos Mouros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189164-d195786-Reviews-Castelo_dos_Mouros-Sintra_Sintra_Municipality_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Sintra, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
Incredible conversion/expansion of a monastery into a spectacular fairytale castle,"King Ferdinand II bought the monastery of Our Lady of Pena, located on the second highest point of the Sintra hills, in 1838 and restored and expanded it into Pena Palace using classical and Manueline architecture with influences from the Middle Ages and Romanticism. The outside looks like a medieval palace with towers, turrets, and arched gateways, painted with bright colors of red and yellow, tempered by lovely shades of gray and cream. It resembles a fairy castle with both round and square towers and domes, rather than the pointed gothic style. The park and palace, outstanding examples of Portuguese Romanticism, have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Anticipating crowds, we took a train from Lisbon (free with our Lisbon Card) at 8:10 am, arriving in Sintra at 8:45, then got a city bus pass for the one route we needed, and boarded the bus at 9:15. Timing was perfect—we arrived just as they were opening the gates at 9:30. We walked up the hill through the beautiful forest, rather than waiting in line to take the tram, so we were among the first to enter. Because of the way the palace was set up, the tour started in the cloister of the ancient monastery, so we made our way around the inner courtyard to see the smaller rooms around the sides (a pantry, dining room, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and an office—all looked intimate, cozy, and livable). We had to walk virtually single-file, so even though not that many people were there, it was still a slow process + guides with groups stopped to narrate and created further problems. I cannot imagine what it would have been like later in the day with larger crowds! We passed the monastery bell tower turned clock tower and ascended the stairs to the series of small rooms converted from monks’ chambers to a bathroom, colorful bedrooms, sitting rooms, a tea room, and studies for Ferdinand II and his second wife, the Countess of Edla. All were furnished with beautiful jade and porcelain, carved wooden furniture, and high vaulted ceilings. We stepped outside on a beautiful large patio/balcony overlooking the front of the palace and the entryway—views were spectacular. Back inside we passed through a small smoking room with an amazing green and blue Venetian glass chandelier, marble alcoves, and carved wooden windows. Then we moved into the older section of the palace and a huge greeting hall/waiting room, complete with Moorish servant statues holding chandeliers, and sofas everywhere. Upstairs again, we found the “stag room,” which resembled a hunting lodge—antlers all around the white, gold-trimmed walls, a beautiful center post with ribs extending outward from it toward the vaulted ceiling, and magnificent, vibrantly-colored stained glass. Finally, we made our way down a very long spiral staircase to the immense kitchen. It was truly a romantic/ medieval combo castle. As we exited, we were astounded by the huge lines of people waiting to get in. We hurried to the back patio and on to the chapel, hoping to see it before the crowds overwhelmed us. It was small, but a lovely gem. The 1532 altarpiece, in alabaster and black limestone, depicted scenes from the Annunciation, Nativity, Presentation at the Temple, Adoration of the Magi, and Flight to Egypt with the Resurrection in the center. There were also two magnificent stained-glass windows in vibrant colors. After taking in the view from the patio, we made our way down the mountain again, passing people lined up at least halfway down—and it was only 11:30. We loved this palace, and you will too—if you are there at 9:30 when it opens!",June 2019,Park and National Palace of Pena,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189164-d195785-Reviews-Park_and_National_Palace_of_Pena-Sintra_Sintra_Municipality_Lisbon_District_Centra.html,"Sintra, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Fairy castle with wizard's garden-- towers, turrets, a spiral staircase + a magical maze","During the 1840’s, Dona Ermelinda, Baroness of Regaleira, built this castle as a summer residence. It became a landmark on the elegant route to the Royal Palace and Palacio. During the summer, the presence of the royal family and court made Sintra elegant and cosmopolitan, so bourgeois estates were built alongside aristocratic ones, and it became fashionable to party along this circuit. We walked along the street, lined with ancient walled gardens, secret niches, and towering trees, to reach the entrance to the gardens. From there we began our mystical journey up the hill, winding our way through forests and gardens with massive walls, towers, and turrets, to the secret staircase. We entered what looked like a hobbit hole, overgrown with moss and plants, to find a stone staircase spiraling downward to a tiled circle six stories below. Then the trail led through a cave to a maze of pathways ending in waterfalls, stepping stones across a stream, and finally to a bridge that took us out of the maze. We continued down the mountain, past more forests and gardens, and a lovely yellow, red, and gray stone mosaic wall and fountain, until we caught a glimpse of the castle to which we were headed, with its massive stone walls, towers, and spires. Further down the path, we came upon the lovely chapel with gothic spires on top and baroque decoration within. At last we arrived at the main house. The second owner, Monteiro, wanted to recreate the Manueline style in the house and gardens to revive the art and architecture associated with the epic “age of discoveries” and the reign of King Manuel I—the period of greatest splendor and creativity of Portuguese culture. He definitely succeeded. The first room we visited was sunny yellow and had the most beautiful white plaster fireplace and ceiling with delicate carving and statues—like icing on a huge wedding cake. Mosaics in lovely pastels—yellow, pink, green, and blue—appeared above and below the fireplace, and even on the floor. Next, the large hall was paneled with rich, red-brown wood and the walls were dotted with “CM” monograms of the Carvalho/Monteiro family, interlaced with ribbons. Rooms continued with fanciful pastel-colorful paintings of 18th-century garden scenes in baroque/rococo style and elaborately-carved wooden doors and ceilings, compete with cherubs. Exploring the castle and grounds was like something out of a Tolkein novel--a magical experience!",June 2019,Quinta da Regaleira,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189164-d484394-Reviews-Quinta_da_Regaleira-Sintra_Sintra_Municipality_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Sintra, Portugal",attractions,5.0,5.0
Wonderful royal palace,"Using our Lisbon Card, we took the 40-minute train ride from Lisbon to the lovely mountain village of Sintra, then walked the short distance to reach the National Palace. It was a beautiful walk—flowers, trees, and lovely villas everywhere along the way. A large white palace with two huge chimneys that looked like conical grain towers came into view. Originally an Arab construction, it was the residence of the Portuguese royal family from the 12th until the late 19th century. In the middle ages it was used as the court’s summer retreat and for hunting. Because it spanned so many centuries, there were many additions, so the architectural style is a combination of Gothic, Mudejar, and Manueline. The palace was amazing—beautifully decorated and so different from any we’ve seen elsewhere—except maybe the Al Hambra in Granada, Spain. Moorish tiles, heavy wooden furniture and doors, huge medieval open fireplaces, and the most amazing wooden ceilings—some barrel vaulted—others in patterned squares and triangles. One barrel-vaulted gallery had beautiful paintings of ships painted along the side panels—another square-patterned ceiling had a beautiful bird painted in each square. The bedrooms had massive carved dark wood beds with beautiful canopies. The Blazons Hall Tower was a real highlight of the castle. The ceiling of carved and gilded wood was crowned by the royal coat of arms of Manuel I and surrounded by the crests of 72 noble families. The lower walls displayed amazing panels of blue and white tiles, depicting courtly and hunting scenes. Originally separated from the house, the 15th-century kitchen has been authentically restored. The Manueline Hall, the early 16th-century main hall of the royal residence, was magnificent with its coved, square-sectioned wooden roof, large tiled fireplace, and massive Venetian glass chandelier. There was also a lovely courtyard with fountains and grotto, typical of summerhouses of the Manueline period. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this wonderful castle.",June 2019,Sintra National Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189164-d1198741-Reviews-Sintra_National_Palace-Sintra_Sintra_Municipality_Lisbon_District_Central_Portuga.html,"Sintra, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.0
"Beautiful 16th-century tower, complete with dungeon!","Although we did not visit the 16th-century Torre de Belem, which serves as a monument to Portugal's ""Age of Discovery"" on land and sea, we had a wonderful view of it as our cruise ship made its way toward port in Lisbon.

So many wonderful coaches in one place--amazing experience!,"After seeing the Jeronimos Monastery and the Monument of Discoveries, we decided to visit this museum before returning to Lisbon because it was free with our Lisbon Card. We were delighted to discover that it actually had the most comprehensive collection of historic coaches we have ever seen in one place. The earliest was 1619, the fanciest were 1700’s, but there were also some from the 1800’s and 1900’s. Several really elaborate ones were used in the procession of the Portuguese embassy sent to Pope Clement XI in 1716 for the coronation of Lisbon as capital of the Portuguese empire. Another special carriage was given by the Pope to the king to carry the “blessed ribbons” intended for he baptism of his son. There were also some very unique transport vehicles—a “hunting car” with a removable roof and roll-up blinds and a transport without wheels (poles fixed to the sides allowed a horse to be hooked up to the front and the back at the same time—no idea how this really worked). We enjoyed our visit!",June 2019,Museu Nacional dos Coches,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189153-d195317-Reviews-Museu_Nacional_dos_Coches-Belem_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Belem, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
Don't miss this 16th-century architectural masterpiece,"Built in the first half of the 16th century, this monastery is an architectural marvel. The cloister was a place for recreation and meditation for the monks. Built in the delicate, lacy Manueline style, it has a beautiful covered walkway built around a central courtyard and beautifully carved pillars with religious, royal, and natural symbols. From the cloister, we climbed a staircase which accessed the choir loft of the Santa Maria Church and provided a breathtaking view of the church below, the Gothic rib-vaulted ceiling, and the gilded decorations of the loft itself. Returning to the cloister, we walked around the square to see the beautiful side rooms, the most magnificent of which was the monastery dining hall with its amazing fan-vaulted ceiling. A beautiful carved stone “rope” ran along the walls on all sides at chair-rail level and served the border for the most spectacular set of blue and yellow tile panels, each showing a different biblical scene. Admission is 10 Euros (free with a Lisbon card) and definitely worth a visit.",June 2019,Mosteiro dos Jeronimos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d195318-Reviews-Mosteiro_dos_Jeronimos-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
Breathtaking medieval church--incredible example of a Gothic rib-vaulted ceiling!,"This UNESCO World Heritage Site church was built 1492-1528 in late Gothic/early Renaissance style. Entrance was free and there were large crowds, so it was a little hard to navigate, but we were awestruck by the unbelievably high vaulted ceiling and the grey stone with lovely decorative roping that ran up the columns and across the ribs in the vaults above. There were a number of tall, thin stained-glass windows in really deep colors which did not let in a lot of light, so the church had that dark, medieval feel. The main altar combined gilt and marble with beautiful artwork. Tombs of Vasco da Gama and Lagos Henriques (foremost Portuguese poet) are located in the back of the church. The sacristy is the hidden gem—and they do charge admission for it (1.5 Euros), but it was definitely worth it. The most distinctive feature is the column in the center of the room. Springing from the top of it are the ribs of the vaulted ceiling. Four additional columns connect to the central one via their vaulted ribs. Because the ceiling is low in this room, it was easy to see the ribbed vaulting close up, rather than having to see it from so far away (like in the main sanctuary). This church is truly a Gothic architectural marvel.",June 2019,Santa Maria de Belem Church,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d4053457-Reviews-Santa_Maria_de_Belem_Church-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
Tiles R Us--history of Portuguese tile art in a spectacular 16th-century setting,"The amazing museum is located in the former Convent of Madre de Deus (founded in 1509) so the building (the cloister, vestry, upper choir, and St. Anthony’s Chapel) and its original tile work are spectacular examples of 1500’s art and architecture in themselves. In Portugal glazed tiles have been used since the 13th century. Initially tiles displayed plain colors and geometric shapes, but by the 16th century more decorative patterns, based on Hispanic, Moorish, and Islamic knot work and geometric patterns, emerged. These were gradually replaced by European motifs with plant and animal patterns, as well as gothic and romantic motifs. The museum’s collection traces tile development from the second half of the 15th century to present day. It was wonderful to wander from room to room and watch the stylistic changes in the tiles as time progressed. We saw everything from giant religious wall presentations and altarpieces, to fully-tiled rooms and stairwells, to hunting scenes and flowers, to fairytales and legends retold in tiles, to colorful tiled maps of Lisbon. St. Anthony’s Chapel was especially impressive—beautiful barrel-vaulted ceiling with a huge dome, blue and white tiled scenes along the back and side walls, and baroque gilding throughout. This museum is truly one of a kind—a Lisbon must see.",June 2019,Museu Nacional do Azulejo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d195776-Reviews-Museu_Nacional_do_Azulejo-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
Spectacular views--especially at sunset!,"This impressive fortification was built by the Moors in the middle of the 11th century. It was the last defensive stronghold of the elite who lived in the citadel. In 1147, Dom Alfonso Henriques conquered Lisbon and became the first king of Portugal. The old Moorish buildings were enlarged and modified to accommodate the king, court, and bishop, as well as the royal archives. During the 13th-16th centuries the Royal Palace was located here. In 1580, when Portugal became part of the Spanish crown, Castelo San Jorge took on a more important military role, which continued until the early 20th century. When the 1755 earthquake significantly damaged the royal residence and gardens, military defense became its primary use. We used our Lisbon card to take Tram #28 to a stop very near the Castel San Jorge and walked the short distance up the hill to reach the entrance at 7:00 pm, since we wanted to see sunset from this vantage point. There was no line and entrance was quick and free with our Lisbon card. Spectacular panoramic views from the lower walls over the city allowed us to easily identify many of the points of interest that we had already visited. Wandering through the remains of the beautiful gardens, we made our way to the permanent exhibition showing the findings of archaeological studies of the area and remnants of pottery, tiles, and other artifacts from 7th-century BC to 20th-century AD. Then we headed to the remains of the fortification itself. Passing through the small arched gate, we emerged into a large courtyard with trees and an ancient cistern. Making our way to the steep, narrow steps, we climbed to the top of the wall to explore the remaining towers and walk along the ramparts. Different panoramas of the city and river below opened up as we continued to move along the ramparts and made stops at the various towers. As sunset approached the colors in the sky and the clouds became more intense, and we got some amazing pictures. Just as the sun finally slipped beyond the horizon, we made our way down, and exited just at the 9:00 pm closing time. We could not have picked a more beautiful evening—or a more perfect time of day to explore this phenomenal ancient fortress.",June 2019,Castelo de S.

"Perfect way to see ""local Lisbon""","Although we had to wait in line about 40 minutes to get a seat on historic Tram #28, which had been recommended as the best way to tour the neighborhoods of old Lisbon, once we did get on it was a lovely ride, and we really got a feel for how the locals live. On the return our tram had a mechanical problem so we had to get off and wait for the next one to arrive. Fortunately, we got off in a delightful little square where a small band was playing and the locals were socializing so we enjoyed listening and people-watching until the next tram arrived. We rode that tram until I saw a sign pointing the way to the Castelo do San Jorge. Since it was late afternoon and the castle was exactly where we wanted to be for sunset, we got off the tram in another beautiful square, overlooking the city and the sea below. We took some lovely photos and listened to two wonderful musicians—a violinist and a guitarist—before setting off to climb the hill toward the castle. Tram #28 lived up to its reputation for us—a great way to see how the locals live, to hear local musicians play, and to meet the locals having fun!",June 2019,Tram 28,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d262792-Reviews-Tram_28-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.0

We shared a picnic table (checkered table cloth and all) with friendly Lisbon locals and pigged out on ham & cheese on fresh focaccia, marinated olives, fresh cherries, Sangria, and Belem-style pastries.

Ghost of a magnificent Gothic Church--eerie but incredible!,"Santa Maria do Carmo, founded in 1389, was one of the most beautiful Gothic churches in Lisbon until the 1755 earthquake caused major damage to the building and destroyed nearly all of its religious and artistic contents. Reconstruction began in an experimental Gothic style in 1756, but stopped in 1834, when religious orders were abolished in Portugal, leaving the naves and transept uncovered and chapels incomplete. The basic 14th-15th-century structures and features remain, including the west and south portals. We rode the Santa Justa Elevator up from near Rossio Square, and it dropped us a short half block from Santa Maria do Carmo. We enjoyed the lovely garden in front of the church while we waited for it to open at 10:00 am. It was an eerie feeling to walk through the shell of this once magnificent Gothic church—walls and buttresses stood open to the sky. The walls and floors were filled with historic artifacts—medieval family crests, an old alms box where parishioners deposited money for the poor, some statues and pieces of statues, a beautiful Manueline (16th-century) window and tomb, corbels with womens’ faces, a baptismal font, and much more. Inside the restored section, behind the transept, was the museum containing an odd collection of artifacts from pre-history to the present--a boy and a girl mummy, objects from ancient Mexico and Peru, tombs of royalty, and other incongruous objects.The structure itself, with its Gothic vaulted ceiling, amazing 16th-century blue and white tile mosaic of the passion of Christ on one wall, colorful family crests and statues, and a magnificent library with wonderful carved wooden bookshelves was amazing.",June 2019,Carmo Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d1996418-Reviews-Carmo_Archaeological_Museum-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5

Even that early we had to wait for the second elevator up, so be warned, the lines do get longer as the day progresses. Once we exited the elevator, we climbed the tiny spiral staircase to the platform above, where we had the most incredible views of Rossio Square and the city below reaching toward the sea, as well as the ruins of the old church of Santa Maria do Carmo, founded in 1389 (which can be easily reached by exiting the platform and walking a mere half block). We wandered through the neighborhood for a little while, enjoying the cobbled stone streets, the beautiful trees and flowers, and garden in front of the church ruins, since we had to wait for them to open at 10:00.

"If you see nothing else in Casablanca, you must see this magnificent mosque","Pure Moroccan architecture at its best and the only mosque in the city that non-Muslins are allowed visit, it is the largest in Africa and 3rd largest in the world (after Mecca and Medin). Built 1987-93 by 15,000 workers and 3,000 hand-craftsmen, it can hold 100,000 worshippers—30,000 (25,000 men and boys + 5,000 women) in the main prayer room and 70,000 in the square outside. The minaret, 60 stories high, is the largest in the world. This mosque was built with $1,300,000,000 in donations from 400,000 foreigners. After that description by our tour guide, we thought we knew what to expect, but we were awestruck when we stepped off the tour bus in front of this most magnificent mosque and minaret. Simple, yet elegant and imposing, the beautiful cream-colored buildings and archways, with lovely mosaic work, in beautiful shades of green and blue, with touches of orange and yellow, rose in front of us. Walking across the immense square took some time, but we finally arrived at the entrance. Our guide knocked solidly on the nearly invisible mosaic door, and we were allowed inside. It was cavernous—high, high ceilings and giant spaces—beautiful archways, glass patterned windows, and huge chandeliers everywhere--gorgeous mosaics on walls and columns—granite pillars—inlaid marble floors. The roof was retractable and could be opened to reveal the sky. I can’t imagine how much more beautiful it would be with light pouring into the space from above! After seeing the main sanctuary, we went downstairs to the ablutions room, which was full of beautiful low-standing round marble fountains where the men would wash feet, hands, arms, and head three times before going back upstairs to pray.

Disappointing,"We were looking forward to wandering through the Old Medina, but it turned out to be a disappointment. Lots of cheap souvenir stalls + stalls and shops selling shoes, clothes, and regular household items. The narrow streets wound around into the neighborhoods, which were not very welcoming. There was some interesting architecture and local store front shops. Lots of large wooden carts being wheeled through the street with fresh fruits, vegetables, and even eggs. (Each cart had one owner and one type of food.) Lots of people walking, some riding scooters quite fast through the alleyways, children playing, and much chaos.

Disappointing--not the romantic Casablanca we expected,"First stop on our tour of the city was Quartier Habous. This area, also referred to as the New Medina was built in 1906-07, but still has the look of old Casablanca.

A chilling walk through history and the tunnels of war,"Defense of the Rock and Gibraltar below has always been a problem—everyone wanted to control this strategic location—particularly the British, Spanish, and French. Work was begun by the British to hollow out these tunnels May 25,1782. It took six weeks to cut the first hole to the outside. By January 14, 1783, four guns had been mounted, and this tunnel, “The Windsor Gallery,” was completed May 11, 1783. The “Great Siege” (the 14th in a series) began in 1779 and lasted over three years, until the British finally succeeded in expelling the combined French and Spanish forces. The tunnel was further excavated during this siege as a way of getting cannon into a large natural projection in the cliff (the Notch). Until this was achieved, Spanish forces could advance using the cliff as shelter from bombardment from the existing fortifications. Tunneling continued even after the Great Siege ended. They hollowed out the space below the Notch and installed an entire gun battery. This large, high-ceilinged chamber was named “St George’s Hall,” and it was there that Churchill and Eisenhower planned the attack on Africa during WWII. Changes were made in the defense systems, more tunnels were added, and powerful searchlights were installed to defend against air strikes during WWII. It was sobering to wander through these tunnels, see the various gun installments, and realize the horrors of war that have taken place in them over the centuries. We felt the ghosts of soldiers past as we made our way through. Everyone should make this historic journey to better appreciate the freedoms we have. It helps to have a guide who can narrate the history—and take a sweater, the tunnels are chilly.",May 2019,The Great Siege Tunnels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187510-d546154-Reviews-The_Great_Siege_Tunnels-Gibraltar.html,Gibraltar,attractions,5.0,4.5

We rode past the Columbus statue, the Olympic port, the Palace de Palau, the Gothic Quarter, and Plaza Catalunya, listening to the wonderful commentary provided, and disembarked at Passeig de Gracia, where we walked to Casa Battlo and toured it. We picked the bus up again after the tour and headed to Sagrada Familia. Finishing there, we walked to another stop, and picked up the bus that took us to the Gothic Quarter. We made our way to the Gothic Cathedral and then wandered through the narrow alleyways, and interesting squares to Las Ramblas, where we strolled along, enjoying the street artists, tented restaurants, and people-watching.

Great place to wander around and lose yourself in the medieval atmosphere!,"We wandered through the old Gothic Quarter, taking in the facades of walls, buildings, and old castles.

That’s the problem with cruises—not enough time to see everything. Fortunately, we have traveled to Barcelona on other occasions and spent more time in this wonderful city!

Incomparable architecture--must be seen to be believed--prepare for crowds!,"The cornerstone of the Basilica of the Sagrada Familia was laid in 1882, but Gaudi took over the design and construction in 1883. From 1914 until his death in 1926, he devoted all of his time to this project. Because no government funds have been used, the church continues to be built very slowly—relying on donations. In 2005 UNESCO declared it a “World Heritage Site,” and in 2010 Pope Benedict XVI consecrated it as a minor basilica. Apparently, Gaudi originally neglected to get a building permit, so now the church has acquired millions of dollars in fines, in addition to the continued building costs. The entrance fees from 3,000,000 visitors each year + donations keep the project going. Although the façade did seem like it had developed more since our last visit (over 20 years ago), we agreed that it still looks like a big mess, with cranes sticking out everywhere. The “glory façade” (front section) does have the colorful mosaic tops and interesting tall spires characteristic of Gaudi, but the back really has no color—all muddy brown—and there are so many things going on that it is hard to focus. We did not try to visit the inside, since there were still large crowds—even at 7:15 pm. Despite all the criticism, it is an awe-inspiring building, the likes of which you will not see anywhere else in the world—so definitely a must-see in Barcelona.",May 2019,Basilica of the Sagrada Familia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190166-Reviews-Basilica_of_the_Sagrada_Familia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,4.0,4.5
This Gaudi Art Nouveaux masterpiece will make you smile at every turn,"Casa Battlo is truly one of Gaudi’s Catalan Art Nouveaux masterpieces. His organic style was inspired by nature and is totally magical. We took an audio tour with an amazing device that not only gave us descriptions and history of what we were seeing, but also the ability to see (virtually) the furnishings and the overall look of each room, as it appeared when the Battlo family lived here. (There was no real furniture in the house.) The initial staircase wound up to the 1st floor in typical Gaudi style—no straight lines. We passed through a reception room decorated in brilliant golds, with a small mushroom-shaped cubby on one side containing a fireplace with benches on either side—presumably for “chaperoned” visits with the daughters of the house. Beautiful honey-colored, art deco-style carved doors (with upper transoms of stained glass in blue, green, yellow, and rose-violet) led to a sitting room and then to the main living room facing the street. It had an expansive three-coved set of windows with intricately carved frames and magnificent multi-colored glass. They were surrounded by pillars and domes of plaster reminiscent of a Tolkein hobbit house. Opposite the windows there had been a huge chest that opened into an altar when the family wanted to pray. The house was not just a work of art, but also an engineering masterpiece. Gaudi included a large central double shaft that opened all the way from the ground floor to the roof skylights to allow air and light to filter down. Rooms on upper levels had beautiful, uniquely-shaped stained-glass windows opening onto the central light shaft. Windows on lower floors were larger (to let in more light), while those higher up were smaller (since they were closer to the light source). A series of slats that could be opened or closed to regulate the air flow was installed under each window. The shaft was tiled in blue—darker blue on the highest level and gradually fading to lighter blue on lower floors to make the whole shaft appear to be the same color. Passing through the family dining room (much like the living room), we found ourselves in a beautiful garden courtyard, with mosaic sculptures, fountains, floors, and walls—all covered with multi-colored broken tile and glass pieces. The back façade of the house had wonderful curved balconies with flower pots, grillwork, and a fanciful frieze of colorful flowers and shapes. Back into the house and up the stairs, we finally reached the attic level with beautiful rib-arched hallways and the rooms used for laundry and storage. Climbing the small spiral staircase, we emerged on the rooftop to find the most spectacular views of the surrounding city and the most breathtaking mosaic sculptures of all. Each chimney was a fanciful work of art. There was also a colorful dragon—or at least part of him (the spine and tail) and a beautiful cross. Exiting through the gift shop, we also got to see a number of original chairs designed by Gaudi. It was an amazing tour!",May 2019,Casa Batllo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d191052-Reviews-Casa_Batllo-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Spectacular scenery, fresh air, magnificent monastery and church...but huge crowds","The first monastery on Montserrat was built by Benedictine monks in 1025. Legend has it that, in the 12th century, men saw a light coming from a cave in this mountain. Investigating, they found a statue of the Virgin Mary, but when they started to carry her down to the village, she burst into flames. They returned her to the cave and built a church for her. This is now the “Black Madonna,” enshrined in the Basilica of the monastery and patron saint of Catalunya.
We booked a tour through our cruise ship and made the trip to Montserrat via bus. The drive from Barcelona (1 ½ hours) through the mountains was beautiful. We arrived at 10:30 a.m. and made our way through the crowds of people, past a lovely farmer’s market selling cheese, honey, and special cakes made in the area. Climbing the hill, we entered the city gate, and continued uphill to the plaza, where we had spectacular views of the surrounding mountains, the cable car that you can ride to the very top of the mountain, and the valleys below. As we crossed under the archway to enter the cloister, the guide pointed out a bricked-in archway in the right-hand wall—the only remaining gate from the 1025 monastery. We stepped into the center of the cloister, dominated by a modern wire sculpture of a human head (temporary exhibition) and were suddenly aware of the dichotomy between the ancient and the modern in this place. Monks’ chambers lined the sidewalls of the cloister and the massive entrance to the church stood in front of us. A long line was already forming along the right side of the cloister with people who wanted to climb up a back stairway to stand right in front of the Black Madonna. We chose not to do that, since it takes hours in line to reach her. Instead, we managed to get into the church just as the crowds from mass were exiting and were able to get a few unobstructed pictures of the main altar and the Black Madonna—before they let people from the line stand in front of her. In addition to the beautiful marble altar, the church had magnificent stained-glass windows along the side walls and an incredible rose window over the choir loft. There were also amazing bronze and silver lamps of different stained-glass and jeweled designs hanging just above head level along the aisles. Unfortunately, their incredible boys choir was not singing in the church the day we were there, but we did get to hear a recording of them when we checked out the museum and the video presentation showing the history of the monastery. While visiting the enormous gift shop, with every religious souvenir imaginable, including black madonnas in every shape and size, we sampled several of the liqueurs produced by the monks, which were also for sale. One last view of the beautiful mountains and valley below from the lookout station near the parking lot, and we were back on the bus.

We finally managed to get the driver to roll up the plastic sides, so at least we had a clearer view. By the time we stopped at the farm and were able to get out of the vehicle, it had stopped raining, so we were able to walk around a little, take a few pictures unencumbered, and taste the yogurt made there.

Amazing historic papal residence--see it now while it is open,"Castel Gandolfo was declared property of the Holy See in the 13th century, but the castle was not built until the 17th century when other villas and cottages were being built in this area. It was renovated by Pope Pius XI in 1929 and has been used as the pope’s summer residence since them. During WWII 40 babies were born in the bedroom here, to mothers trying to escape the Nazis. Pope John Paul recovered from his injuries here when he was shot in 1980. The current Pope Francis declared that it should be open to the public since he preferred to stay in Rome and work. As we entered the gates of the Apostolic Palace, we passed the small fleet of Mercedes cars used by the Pope and the “Popemobile” with the bulletproof shell. Continuing, we made our way through display rooms showing the costumes of the Swiss Guards, the portable throne used to carry the pope in processions, and other items used by the pope. Next came galleries with portraits of all the popes, followed by a lovely cream, yellow, and gold waiting room where guests who had an audience with the pope were taken first. From there, we went through a series of waiting rooms (ante-rooms). A group of people might be granted an audience, but ultimately only one would actually see the pope. The others in the group would go as far as their “status/permission” allowed them and would wait in their assigned ante-room. The last ante-room was normally reserved for the wife of the man who had the audience. Finally came the magnificent throne room where the pope received the person granted an audience. Following that, all rooms were private. The general public was not allowed—only his private secretaries. A series of offices came next—some with elaborate desks and bookshelves and others with much simpler furniture. Then the pope’s bedroom, which was a bright and airy corner room with creamy yellow walls and mint-green drapes on four large windows. The furniture—a large bed, wardrobe, desk, and table with chairs—was made of beautifully carved wood and looked comfortable and lived-in. The bedroom opened onto a lovely little chapel with an altar and the pope’s own chair and kneeler. Following the chapel was a large gallery which led us back to the square outside. We really enjoyed being able to see this historic place. We have been to Italy on many previous occasions, but Castel Gandolfo was never open to the public before—and could be closed again, at the discretion of the pope.

Incredible theatre--amazing historical tour--not to be missed!,"Built in 1737, Teatro di San Carlo is the oldest working theatre in Europe, and one of the most prestigious. Destroyed by fire in 1816, it was redesigned and rebuilt within 10 months by order of King Ferdinand IV. By 1854, another refurbishment changed the theatre’s interior to the magnificent gold baroque trim, red velvet curtains and seats, and spectacular ceiling paintings that we see today—by guided tour only. Be sure to check with the box office early in the day to get tickets for an English tour, which lasts 45 minutes, and is very much worth it. Our guide was amazing. She, not only gave us the history of the theatre itself, but also described the theatre experience of the time, which was similar to that of Shakespeare’s Globe. All of the boxes were purchased by wealthy citizens, so each family had its own box to do with as they pleased. They could invite friends and relatives to join them. The boxes were treated like their own personal residences so they could eat, drink, play chess, and even fornicate (Casanova was a box owner). The family also brought their servants who stood outside the box, so the halls were crowded and many patrons complained about the smell, since servants weren’t always so clean. The ground level was occupied by the lower classes and the front (orchestra area) was reserved for the military so they could help keep order—and so they could see the dancers’ legs! All of the “groundlings” had to provide their own benches; they could rent them from vendors outside the theatre or bring in benches they owned. It was a chaotic social atmosphere. The performance was secondary. People went to the theatre to be seen. Each box had a mirror that reflected the king’s box, so regardless of what the occupants were doing, they could see the king when he arrived and stand to greet him. To make more money, gambling rooms were created for patrons in 1778. It was not until Verdi (1840’s) and Wagner (1880’s) that the performance became the focus, and patrons actually began to attend the opera to listen to the music and watch the opera.

Beautiful 18th-century palace of the Bourbon Kings,"The Royal Palace of the kingdom of Naples, built in 1733 by the Bourbon King Charles of France, was somewhat nondescript from the outside, but amazing inside. It was built near the port, in case the king fell out of favor and had to make a quick escape. Entrance is normally 10 euros, but they do give senior discounts, so we only had to pay 7. The entrance staircase was magnificent—reminded us of the one in St. Petersburg, but all white. Upstairs we started with the king’s rooms—many audience chambers. Guests moved from one chamber to the next, each one getting closer to the throne room. Your importance was determined by how close to the throne room you were actually allowed to go. Usually only one person from the group would actually get to see the king. The other side of the palace contained the queen’s rooms—similar configuration. There was also a huge ballroom, a beautifully appointed theatre, and a magnificent chapel. All rooms were beautifully decorated—mostly in gold and reds, with lots of beautiful artwork and amazing ceilings, but little furniture. The palace was built for the Bourbon kings and had rooms that reflected 16th-18th-century decorations, depending upon which king had occupied them.

Beautiful piazza--surrounded by beautiful churches,"The impressive spire of the Immaculate Virgin at the center of this square is unmistakable. She is surrounded by amazing churches.

Majolica tile art in the cloisters is breathtaking!,"The Gothic church of Santa Chiara was originally built 1310-28 by the will of King Roberto d’Angio and his wife, Sancia, of Majorca. They wanted to build a Franciscan citadel to house a convent and a monastery. During the 18th century, the monarchs updated the church with baroque decoration and created the beautiful cloister, with amazing majolica tiles representing social scenes, to introduce art and to give the nuns a chance to see what life was like outside the convent. The church was heavily bombed during WWII, but was restored to its original Gothic style afterwards. Giotto had painted most of the frescoes in the original church, but only pieces/parts of them were recovered to show how the originals looked. Despite the rain on the day we visited, we enjoyed wandering through the church and the old cloisters, restored to their former glory. The majolica tiles were vibrantly colorful and the scenes they portrayed gave us insight into the lives of the people of 1700’s Naples. The biblical scene frescoes along the side walls of the cloister were also amazing, and there was an adjoining museum where we saw many interesting artifacts and an archaeological excavation. A definite hidden gem in Naples.",May 2019,Complesso Monumentale di Santa Chiara,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187785-d243317-Reviews-Complesso_Monumentale_di_Santa_Chiara-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5

This magnificent Maltese palace has a great history--don't miss it!,"This magnificent 16th-century palace of a noble Maltese family is the only privately-owned palazzo open to the public and definitely a “must see.” Owned by the Marquis de Piro, the family lives above the two floors that are open to the public, and they use those floors when tours are not going on. Greeted by a large blue and yellow macaw, we started the tour in the enclosed courtyard/garden, enjoying the fountain and the lovely garden. Upstairs we toured the main floor--sitting rooms, dining rooms (one winter/one summer), bedrooms, a study, and a small chapel. We also toured the basement. Originally a well for the house, it was converted to bomb shelter rooms during WWII—one for the family and two others for the local citizens. (Malta was heavily bombed during WWII since it served as Eisenhower’s headquarters for the invasion of Sicily and Italy.) The furnishings and artwork were magnificent, but unlike many palaces that we have visited which seem cold and sterile, this one gave us a really cozy, lived-in feeling. The tour was wonderful.

Stunning medieval cathedral + 2 magnificent Caravaggios,"This cathedral rivals St. Basil’s in Moscow for opulence. Stunning mosaics and gold covered every surface. A huge barrel-vaulted ceiling branched off in many directions. The main altar was the most amazing, but there were 8 side chapels, each one an incredible work of art in itself. The inlaid marble floor was a collection of tombstones, each one a colorful masterpiece revealing the story of the knight who was buried there. We visited the sacristy and then made our way to the balcony, which provided a breathtaking panorama of the nave and sanctuary below. We also visited the secluded Oratory, where two incredible Caravaggios are displayed. “The Beheading of St. John the Baptist” serves as the altarpiece.

"If you see one indoor sight in Athens, make it the Acropolis Museum--it is phenomenal!","As we walked toward the magnificent modern structure that now houses all the significant finds from the Sacred Rock (the Acropolis) and its foothills, we passed over plexiglass panels revealing the excavations below. Parts of buildings, streets, and even water pipes were visible. The location of the museum was strategically chosen so that the entire Acropolis is visible through the outer glass walls of the museum, thus creating a visual link between the archaeological site and the treasures from it now exhibited in the museum. The design was the best we have ever experienced in a museum. We were amazed at the many sculptures, statues, and friezes displayed. Particularly noteworthy were the statues of the Korai (depictions of beautiful young women) from the Erechtheion, the Athena/Nike temple frieze, and the many statues of Athena. On Level 3 a rectangular solid concrete core was built to the same dimensions and orientation as the Parthenon to display the entire temple frieze exactly as it was. The actual pieces recovered from the frieze were mounted in their appropriate locations and missing pieces were then reconstructed and added in a slightly different color so the originals were easily identified. There were also amazing video reconstructions of sections of the frieze that, before our eyes, transformed from their current faded color into the original brightly-colored sculptural pieces. Level 3 also had an amazing video showing the history and construction of the Acropolis, from its early beginnings, through its peak (5th-2nd centuries BC) to its ultimate decline and gradual destruction.

Amazing glimpse of life in a 4000-year-old society--check it out!,"An earthquake in 1613 BC destroyed the site of Akrotiri—the capital city of an advanced civilization with a large middle class that had been there for thousands of years. We could only 5% of what was there—the rest lies below in many un-excavated layers. What we saw came from 2000 BC and shows that the people had created a clay pipe system to bring water from nearby limestone rocks to the town, plumbing and ventilation systems, and tall multi-level buildings—1st example of high-rise apartments. No bodies or jewelry were found here, so the people had enough warning and time to evacuate before the destruction. We were amazed to see what did remain. The former market place had some beautifully decorated jars—a few totally intact.

Breathtaking! Not to be missed!,"The “pink city” was built by Nabataean Arabs whose ancestors had lived in this area from the dawn of time. In 169 BC the king of Petra changed from a nomadic to a settled life and created a kingdom here. Petra provided caravans who traveled the “King’s Highway” trade route with security (and water) and made money. Their houses were simple, but they built elaborate tombs carved into the cliffsides. An earthquake in 749 AD destroyed the civilization here and it was “lost” until 1812 when it was re-discovered by an explorer. In 1984 the government built alternate housing and relocated the Bedouins who were living in Petra. In 1985 it became a Unesco World Heritage Sight and in 2007 was voted a Wonder of the World. It certainly deserves the title. We headed out from the visitor center into the 1-mile long chasm (Siq)—a narrow, twisting pathway hidden between towering sandstone cliffs. As we walked, we passed horses, donkeys, and horse-drawn carts, brightly decorated with colorful blankets and tassels, transporting people through the Siq. We wove our way through the majestically high walls with red, brown, cream, and black veins circulating through them…seeing bits of blue sky peak through above us and taking in the many beautiful tombs carved into the cliffsides. Our guide pointed out parts of an old Roman road and features of an ancient aqueduct, plus numerous votive niches with statues of gods where merchants entering and exiting Petra stopped to pay homage to the gods. We even saw parts of a carving depicting a caravan on its way to the center of town—a man in the lead, followed by a large camel (two of his hooves could be seen clearly, but the body required a bit more imagination). Then, suddenly, we rounded a corner in the narrow gorge and got our first glimpse of the famed Treasury (built in the first century BC as a tomb for a Nabataean king). It was truly breathtaking! Local legend says that treasure was hidden in the urn atop the structure and bullet marks show seekers’ attempts to find it. We emerged from the narrow Siq into a wide, open expanse and were suddenly surrounded by cliffs with tombs and buildings carved into them, camels, donkeys, and a lively market. Quite a change from the peaceful Siq. Rather than walk back the way we had come, we chose to hire donkeys and a Bedouin guide to take us through the rest of the town of Petra, and on to a small village high above the valley, where a car would then take us back to town. I was a little skeptical, especially when the man had to untie a stirrup from another donkey and tie it onto mine so I would have two, but his charming young cousin, who turned out to be our guide, was wonderful. He stopped the donkey anytime I wanted to take a picture—and there were many wonderful opportunities. We made our way through the Outer Siq, past the Street of Facades and the Theatre (carved out of the hillside rock by the Nabataeans in the second century BC to seat 3000 people). There were tombs everywhere—on both sides of the road and up the mountainsides. The temples and public buildings which were originally free standing were destroyed by the earthquake so very few of them remain.
