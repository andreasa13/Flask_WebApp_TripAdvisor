The best hands down.,"This review is a longtime coming. We booked a tour with Michael to see the history of the Apostle Paul's footsteps. But what we got was so much more!! Michael is a true Christian in even sense of the word. He loves Christ and loves to share his knowledge of the area. He will take you to places you never dreamed of and tell you all about each area. At the end of the tour we prayed and just had a good ol' fashioned Christian time. This was truly a wonderful experience with Michael. Thank you my dear friend and so sorry for taking so long to write this review for you. Steve, CiCi, Richard &Nancy Grandquist all send our love to you!

Nice Romantic Get Away but...,"We had a nice couple of nights but very noisy. We have stayed here a couple of times in the past as a weekend escape but it seems a litter noisier than in the past. The Hotel is getting a little tired but still worth the stay. The staff. What happened you all used to greet us and be so friendly. Seems like you don't appreciate my business?

DO NOT STAY HERE!!! HORRIBLE,"My wife and I sold our house and had to stay here for three days... Trust the bad reviews on this place. The room we got had a stench that was terrible and the front desk wouldn't change our room. I had to go to the local Home Depot to get something to spray on the carpets... Oh did I mention carpets? FILTHY! Honestly this had to be the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel. This is not to put the other chain down that ends with a 6 but this place makes staying at M6 feel like a 5 star resort. Upon checkout we had to go to a laundromat and wash all of our clothes to get the smell out and then spray down our suitcases. The front desk was not help at all. Also the battery died in the wall thermostat and nobody had batteries. I went and purchased my own batteries for the thermostat. I think the good reviews are a hoax on this place. Do yourself a big favor stay far away from this place.

Very nice and Clean Place to Stay,"We decided to give this place a try due to the moderate price. We have not been sorry! We usually stay at the Hampton next door but we have spent so much time in Hotels we thought we would save a little $$$ by staying here. Great place to stay moderately priced for a good clean comfortable room. The front desk staff has been great and Robin was very helpful for being brand new. He hand carried some extra towels to my room instead of making me go to the front desk. Thank you Robin!!

Overall if you are looking to save a little $$ but looking for a great place to stay look no further you have found your place in Yuba City.
