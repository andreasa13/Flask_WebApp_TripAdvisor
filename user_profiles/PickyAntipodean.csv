Noosa cool gourmet beverage and food experience,"Fantastic choice of beers, gin, cocktails and food.
Choice of modern and classic style beers beg to be tried out (responsibly). The sharing platter and chicken wings are standouts in a surprisingly good food offering.
Friendly and relaxed service in hip but relaxed environment away from the crowds of Hastings Street.
Definately recommended.",May 2021,Land & Sea Brewery x Noosa Heads Distillery Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1192212-d18978471-Reviews-Land_Sea_Brewery_x_Noosa_Heads_Distillery_Tours-Noosaville_Noosa_Sunshine_Coast.html,"Noosaville, Australia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Surprisingly awful meals,"Food was strangely tasteless and seemed bought in although there was a kitchen in use. No idea how such tasteless and mediocre food could result from what sppeared to be fresh ingredients. Best part of my carbonara was the cracked pepper I smothered it in so I could bear to eat it.
Multiple staff said springrolls were delicious- we should have been warned. Like baby chicko rolls but less appetising.
Very basic service topped off an appalling dining decision - mains dropped rapidly onto the table without first removing the starter plates.
We raced to pay and escape.
Never again!
You have been warned - drive to Sunshine Beach for Italian, it will be worth it.",April 2021,Pizzami Gourmet Pizza Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1409801-d12003455-Reviews-Pizzami_Gourmet_Pizza_Bar-Peregian_Beach_Noosa_Sunshine_Coast_Queensland.html,"Peregian Beach, Australia",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Sophisticated Asian Cuisine impressive wine list,"Escaped post COVID-19 Melbourne to explore Macedon Ranges for a couple of days and based ourselves in Kyneton. Booked this excellent restaurant online and it exceeded all expectations. Very knowledgeable staff assisted in making difficult decisions with delicious food made from fresh local ingredients that looked and smelt as good as it tasted. Very flavoursome without being heavy. Great vegetarian dishes. Lengthy list of local and Victorian beverages to spoil you for choice. Would have liked to try everything! Favourite dish was wok seared lamb with chinese celery, chilli and ginger. Definately one to return to when next in the area.",December 2020,Fook Shing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g552198-d18542890-Reviews-Fook_Shing-Kyneton_Macedon_Ranges_Victoria.html,"Kyneton, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Magnificent art collection disappointly presented,"This is a mixed bag of a review.
The Wallace Collection of paintings, furniture, ceramics and armour is justifiably world class. It is very conveniently located off Oxford Street and its cafe and restaurant are very good quality.
Entry is free!
On the other hand, the lavish guidebooks sold at the entrance are large, heavy and correspondingly expensive.
We were very disappointed to find there was a surprisingly poor level of information made available to the visitor who does not buy one of these guidebooks. We hired an audio guide but found out it only mentioned 'highlights' which meant maybe one picture or piece of art was mentioned in a room full of magnificent furniture from Versailles and with walls covered in gorgeous masterpieces. Labelling was limited and some pieces had no identification at all.
So we enjoyed looking at the art but were left wanting information on the majority of the collection.
So the audio guide is a waste of money but unless you are prepared to buy one of the coffee table sized (heavy) books and have room to pack it in your luggage, you will be walking around not knowing much about what you are looking at.
The real highlight was discovering how enjoyable lunch was with a glass of sparkling in the glass roofed courtyard restaurant. Sensory overload hits pretty quickly when looking at such beautiful art and we definately needed a break before finishing the tour by walking through a confusing array of oriental armour and finding the way out.",November 2019,Wallace Collection,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187558-Reviews-Wallace_Collection-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Well preserved Venetian Fortress with stunning views - like a set from GoT!,Dominating the historical town of Napflion. A must climb and see. View from the top is awesome. Very well preserved Venetian fortress. Climbed the 990 steps up from the town just before dawn and saw the sun rise.

Charming historic boutique hotel Napflion old town,Stayed for one night in this very charming boutique hotel as part of a small group tour. After a day of sightseeing it was fantastic to cool down in the pool and enjoy a cold drink in peace and privacy. Superb location in a quiet street in the old town just metres from the harbour esplanade and a leisurely 5 minute stroll to great restaurants and chic shopping. The town is a wonderful blend of old Venetian and Athenian architecture. Walked in the moonlight up 990 steps to the Venetian fortress high above the town to watch the sun rise over Argos and the bay. Unforgettable experience. Would have stayed longer.,October 2019,Ippoliti Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g319780-d613634-Reviews-Ippoliti_Hotel-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great gastro pub Kelso square,"Conveniently located just off Kelso square, this was a great venue for a relaxing lunch.
Fresh sophisticated decore keeping traditional features.
Great menu with broad range of classic and modern food. Ample portions.
Great range of beverage (we had local ale on tap).",October 2019,The Cobbles - Freehouse & Dining,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315999-d1140310-Reviews-The_Cobbles_Freehouse_Dining-Kelso_Scottish_Borders_Scotland.html,"Kelso, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Magical Monemvasia Hotel,"Fabulous relaxing experience within a Byzantine castle town.
Hotel suites are located across the town in restored historical buildings, with reception in one building just within the walls and breakfast served in a centrally located cafe opening onto the town square.
Within the walls are only paved paths and steps so no cars or motorbikes allowed, donkeys move anything heavy.
Luggage was taken to our room by Hercules (who was extremely strong so well named) which was an unexpected bonus that was much appreciated.
You feel you have stepped back in time, except you have an ensuite and airconditioning.
Great tavernas and little shops within the walls to explore as well as the ruined upper castle which offers fantastic views of the sea and shoreline.
Our private patio offered beautiful views across the town to the sea that we could have enjoyed for hours.
Would have stayed longer if we could have.
We stayed here as part of a Pictours of Greece small tour group.
Very highly recommended as a unique experience.",October 2019,Byzantino Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g285708-d278875-Reviews-Byzantino_Boutique_Hotel-Monemvasia_Monemvasia_Municipality_Laconia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Monemvasia, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent gastro pub,"Visited twice over a few days, lunch and dinner. Excellent food range of gastro pub classics and also a special menu that changes (focus on italian when we visited).
We enkoyed warm and efficient service and the comfortable, relaxed atmosphere.
Dog friendly with friendly dogs that were as relaxed as their owners.
Plenty of seating arranged around the bar with two fires keeping the venue nice and warm.
Great beverage selection - both local and international (had local ale on tap, wife had wine).
Very good value for money.
Seemed to be a favourite with both locals and tourists.",October 2019,The Horse and Jockey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662358-d2320452-Reviews-The_Horse_and_Jockey-Whitchurch_Shropshire_England.html,"Whitchurch, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Awesome Acropolis,"This is a must-see incomparable experience of a unique place with great cultural significance.
So much to see from the ancient ruins themselves which still hold great emotional impact to the stunning views of Athens and the surrounding countryside. It is a lot to take in so give yourself plenty of time so you do not feel rushed.
We visited in October when the crowds were less than summer and it was a beautiful sunny day but not too hot. An excellent time to visit.
We had the benefit of being part of a Pictours of Greece small tour group and had an extremely knowledgeable guide which made it very relaxing as we could just enjoy the sights while being informed about the history and significance of what we were seeing. Babis also avoided the worst of the crowds and took us out a side exit we would never have found on our own when it was time for lunch.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Acropolis Museum,"Fantastic state-of-the-art modern museum showing artifacts and scultures from the Acropolis and the Parthenon.
Museum is an ultra modern designed complex located at the foot of the Acropolis at the southern end of the Plaka shopping district. It is a must-see for any visit to Athens.
Ancient houses excavated during construction of the museum are preserved under glass walkways and can be separately visited as part of the entry.
Museum displays ancient potery, figurines and other artifacts including from temples that pre-date the Parthenon. Many still show traces of their original paint.
The top level is laid out like the Parthenon to show the marbles that originally adorned the temple (including replicas of those sculptures now unfortunately in the British Museum in London) and has fantastic views of the Acropolis next door.
We saw this museum after visiting the Parthenon and with a guide provided by Pictours of Greece.
You will get the most out of this museum if you see this museum after visiting the Acropolis.
Recommend purchasing tickets in advance to avoid queues.
We also had the benefit of an excellent guide provided as part of a Pictours of Greece small tour group. Having a guide made the visit to the museum most enjoyable and ensured we didn't miss any of the highlights.",October 2019,Skip the Line: Athens New Acropolis Museum Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12835132-Skip_the_Line_Athens_New_Acropolis_Museum_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
Quality Athenian Restaurant with iconic Acropolis view,"Fantastic restaurant on the top two floors of a building within a quiet residential area immediately south of the Acropolis.
Restaurant offers great service and a wide range of traditional high quality Greek food.
What is outstanding is the surprise view of the Acropolis, especially from the covered roof top terrace. The view is awesome and left guests gasping and reaching for their mobiles to take photos on arriving at their tables. This made an excellent dining experience into a very special event.
Not to be missed if visiting Athens.
Excellent value, a memorable experience.
Visited this restaurant as part of a small tour group hosted by Pictours of Greece.

Excellent Cotswolds gastro pub in gorgeous location,"A gorgeous pub in a typically beautiful Cotswolds village.
Had an excellent lunch with friends at this rustic/glam pub offering great service and food that is traditional but sophisticated.
Extremely welcoming staff managed to find us a table for four on a busy Saturday afternoon when a lot of other people had the same idea of driving through the Cotswolds.
Highly recommended as a good lunch location when touring the Cotswolds.
Wide range of beverages to satisfy all tastes.
Attentive service meant we enjoyed a relaxed meal notwithstanding all tables were occupied.

Amazing experience,"This is a not to be missed if at all possible if you are visiting Kalavrita. The sights are fantastic and the small train makes for a friendly atmosphere.
Likely to be popular so book tickets ahead of time and get on at Kalavrita. We only went down to the coast but it would be worth the return trip.
Well worth it for the dramatic and beautiful scenery so different from other parts of Greece.",October 2019,Odontotos Rack Railway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315841-d2324845-Reviews-Odontotos_Rack_Railway-Kalavrita_Achaea_Region_West_Greece.html,"Kalavrita, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great but no airconditioning,"We visited in October as part of a small tour group. Everyone agreed the hotel was in an excellent location, interestingly decorated and the rooms and ensuites were large and very clean.
However the airconditioning was not switched on in our rooms and after a day of sunshine they were uncomfortably hot. We reported this to reception and were told the airconditioning had been switched to heating and to open the doors of our room onto the balcony. This was the only solution they offered despite advertising rooms with airconditioning.
We reluctantly opened the doors of our room but this meant we heard the large dog across the road, traffic noise, had exterior light shining in to the room and had to deal with mosquitoes. We went to bed wearing insect repellant.
We did not get a good night sleep despite the bed being comfortable.
This ruined our stay in the hotel and our enjoyment of the town and resulted in our poor rating. Had we had airconditioning as advertised the rating would have been higher.",October 2019,Kalavrita Canyon Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315841-d2090495-Reviews-Kalavrita_Canyon_Hotel_Spa-Kalavrita_Achaea_Region_West_Greece.html,"Kalavrita, Greece",hotels,2.0,4.5
Beautiful Elizabethan Mansion,"Magnificent mansion full of old tapestries, paintings and furniture built by 'Bess of Hardwick' a formidable contemporary of Queen Elizabeth I.

Location is stunning high on a hill.
Owned by National Trust with excellent shop and restaurant.

Small group cultural tour of Greece,"The tour exceeded our expectations. We wanted to avoid being part of a herd fighting to see things and hear the guide. Everytime we were chatting in our group under the shade and saw a long group trudging past trying to work out what they should be looking at we felt a little smug. We also wanted to relax and let someone else make all the decisions and worry about logistics. From the moment we came out of customs at Athens airport and were welcomed to Greece by a smiling driver (organised for us) holding up a card with our name and who then took over the luggage, we knew we were going to enjoy ourselves. The hotel in Athens (the Divani) was in a fantastic location for walking to all the sights and for exploring safely on your own and shopping in Plaka. As it was next to the acropolis you couldn't really get lost. We were in a small group of 5 ably guided by Babis and managed and driven by George. There was an obvious rapport between George and Babis who were focused on ensuring we were enjoying ourselves. They conveyed their love for Greek history, geography and culture and Babis was an unending source of information as well as a great story teller. George wanted to show us the real Greece and while we saw the famous ancient sights he also took us to different parts that are usually overlooked. Everyone enjoyed a laugh and seemed to 'click' instantly sharing a common interest in Greece. Every day was different and so it is very difficult to settle on a highlight. The acropolis in Athens and the modern museum were uniquely wonderful as expected, Napflion was beautiful and charming, Monemvasia was exciting and romantic ( you felt you had stepped back in time), wine tasting in Nemea was very enjoyable and picturesque and Olympia was beautifully green and the museum full of astonishing art works. If you want more than the Greece of crowds and beaches then we recommend you consider touring with George and Pictours.",October 2019,Best of Peloponnese In-depth Cultural Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d14787813-Best_of_Peloponnese_In_depth_Cultural_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
Excellent Gastro Pub near Peckforton Castle Cheshire,"We stayed at Peckforton Castle but had dinner here. Great decision.
Food was excellent and plentiful with a good selection making for some difficult decisions.
Wine selection very good.
Service welcoming, efficient and attentive.

Romantic getaway,"We stayed in the Tollemache Suite for two nights mid week.
Pros:
Rooms were very clean, large and impressively decorated in a heavy Victorian style with comfortable furniture and a four poster bed. Ensuite was large and modern with a heated towel rail and both a shower and a separate large bath. Large cupboard included an iron and ironing board, slippers and bathrobe.
The fireplaces were not being used but the rooms were well heated (but not stuffy) and the ensuite had underfloor heating.
Enjoyed exploring the castle which is very atmospheric and impressive both inside and out. We walked along trails through the woodland which was full of pheasant.
Hotel was very quiet despite rooms being full.
Didn't eat dinner at the two restaurants but buffet breakfast in 1851 Restaurant was very good every morning.
Staff were very welcoming and accommodating (we asked for a lighter dooner on the bed).
Cons:
Wife indicated more lighting in the ensuite to put make up on would be an improvement.
Phone in suite didn't work.
Parking is outside of the castle, slightly down hill from a designated luggage drop down location. I wasn't going to lug our bags into the castle and across the courtyard to reception so I drove right up to reception to unload our luggage and check in, then drove the car to the carpark.
