Interesting Concept,"Great place to try out if you're looking for something different. Combine a pizza with another dish/cuisine - nachos, curry, vol au vent, ... Although a tasty and fun experience, I still prefer a standard pizza or a standard curry (for example), so I would not go there often.",March 2020,Otomat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188669-d14004629-Reviews-Otomat-Leuven_Flemish_Brabant_Province.html,"Leuven, Belgium",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Pleasant visit,"I especially liked the collection displaying work from several different artists, as they had more of a story to them, and had more variation from room to room. The larger exhibitions were less interesting to me, but that's because I am not *that* big a fan of photography, so that's not the museum's fault.",January 2021,FOMU - Foto Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188636-d3406231-Reviews-FOMU_Foto_Museum-Antwerp_Antwerp_Province.html,"Antwerp, Belgium",attractions,4.0,4.0
Bookshop or museum?,"You can find the vast and diverse TASCHEN collection here, with beautiful books of all sizes covering a diverse range of topics.

Unique tunnel to nowhere,"I'd been to Antwerp several times without knowing of the existence of this unusual tunnel under the Schelde.

Exhilerating Experience,"First we did the ""Survivor"" escape room, which left us hungry for more, leading us to do the ""Ritual"" escape room the following night. Both were different from what we were used to in escape rooms, as there was live action (actors in the room with you) and physical tasks (climbing/jumping/etc). The ""Ritual"" room was an especially unique experience - while the ""Survivor"" room suggests an extra pair of shoes, the ""Ritual"" room should suggest an extra pair of underwear! Not for the faint-hearted, even the most stoic of our group were screaming and running for their lives.",October 2019,Great Escape Rooms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d7856000-Reviews-Great_Escape_Rooms-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

Keep expectations low,"The Blue Cave was definitely a beautiful spot to visit, but is somewhat over-hyped and very touristy.

Unforgettable day,"Martina and Hrvoje took us on an amazing trip that was the highlight of our holiday in Croatia. Hrvoje was a great skipper, outrunning a storm with minutes to spare - especially impressive as it was his first time in a boat ;) We visited all the places promised, and also had our own say in which spots to visit. We also got to go snorkeling twice in the crystal clear water. A thrilling boat trip through choppy open sea finally brought us back safely to our destination.
