Ask for extra chili sauce :),"I went here with my family for Sunday lunch. Service was good, and the set menu was pretty good value, but the ‘medium spicy’ Spicy Chicken Basil dish tasted pretty bland - we had to ask for extra chili sauce to heat it up. I expect a dish with ‘spicy’ in the name to have a bit of a punch to it, but there were no fresh chilis at all in the dish.
Everything else was perfectly tasty, and service was good, I would go back for the set menu.",February 2020,Lemongrass Fusion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551559-d5810468-Reviews-Lemongrass_Fusion-Naas_County_Kildare.html,"Naas, Ireland",restaurants,3.0,4.5

"Spectacular, but not easy!","I hiked this alone in March, had a perfect day for it! Took about 3.5 hours to get to Oia (once i eventually found my way out of Fira...) and it was well worth the trouble. The views were spectacular, and the sense of achievement when i got to Oia was awesome! I’m not a super experienced hiker, but i’m in reasonable shape, am cautious, and take my time when i need to.
HOWEVER... It’s not as easy as i had heard. There’s one point in particular where i made a poor choice... at one point, a bit over half way through i think, the trail splits. From Fira side, if you take the right trail you have an easier path, with a slightly less spectacular view of the lowlands, rather than the Caldera. At least that’s what i found out after... i took the left trail and found it extremely tricky. More than a few expletives were used... the path was super narrow, riddled with gullys and seemed to be entirely composed of loose red volcanic rocks. Was glad when i got to the bottom...
Going up the next hill I found a bit tricky also, quite a lot of loose rocks and stones.
My advice to novice hikers for this trail: bring a backpack with plenty of water and some snacks, if you have hiking poles, use them, and wear boots. I would definitely not have made it through in sneakers (even if my feet did feel like lead by the end).
And enjoy it! One of the most spectacular views i’ve experiences on a hike, it was stunning.",March 2019,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d2368798-Reviews-Hiking_Trail_Fira_Oia-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Super Seafood!,"This was the first open place i came across in Oia after hiking from Fira in the morning, and i just needed a spot to sit and have a coffee, but when my friends arrived we decided to stay for lunch. So glad we did!! Between 3 of us we shared a greek salad, seafood pasta and grilled gilthead bream (fish of the day) and it was as fabulous as the view we had from the deck. My only regret is not getting the seafood platter (I saw another table order it and had major food envy). Waitress was also super knowledgeable about the menu and gave great wine recommendations. Overall, i highly recommend!",March 2019,Thalami,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d1370689-Reviews-Thalami-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Best calamari ever!,"We ate here our first night in Santorini, and mostly because it was one of the only places open. Waiter was super attentive, and the view could not be beat! I had fried calamari to start, which was so tender i could cut it with my fork, and a swordfish main that was to die for. Will definitely go back next time i’m in Santorini!",March 2019,Niki Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d3323506-Reviews-Niki_Restaurant-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,3.5
"Poor food, terrible service","I will never go back to Tao Garden, or recommend to my friends. I've been to this restaurant twice now. First time the food was ok, but the service was really bad (waitress disappeared, incorrect food was brought). Everyone can have a bad day so I decided to head there on my own for lunch.
When I arrived in the restaurant, I asked a gentleman working there if I could sit under the sheltered area - he responded yes and I took my seat. 30 minutes later, having caught the eye of several waitresses serving other tables, I still had not been given a menu or acknowledged at all, so I went back to the same gentleman to ask for a menu. He was apologetic, handed me a menu and I went back to my table with some optimism. 10 minutes later my waitress found her way to me and took my order. The food was awful. The duck summer rolls were bland. I had to ask if the meat was duck because it was grey and the consistency of overboiled meat. Utterly unrecognisable. The Shiogayaki should have been delicious, but just tasted like salt. The only highlight of the whole thing was the green lemonade.
Through all this, i had two different waitresses, both of whom disappeared for long periods of time (after I finished my main I was waiting 40 minutes for the dessert menu, and another 20 minutes for the bill after). Even when taking away the Shiogayaki, (over half of which was still left when my plate was picked up) neither waitress asked if I needed anything, or if the food was ok.
Generally speaking I do not like writing critical reviews of places. It is not something I make a practice of. However, I was so angry when walking home from this (3 hour long...) lunch that I cannot avoid it.
I have lived in Krakow for almost 7 years and have never experienced service as bad as I have in this restaurant.",July 2018,Tao Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274772-d12832957-Reviews-Tao_Garden-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Always Excellent,"Aqua e Vino is probably my favourite restaurant in Krakow - the food is incredible, the service is fantastic and the atmosphere is so comfortable. The food is also great value for the quality, and the house wine is fabulous.
I really recommend going at the weekend for the fresh fish specials - by far the best quality seafood in Krakow, cooked to perfection.",July 2018,Aqua e Vino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274772-d697084-Reviews-Aqua_e_Vino-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great all round,"I stayed here for a long weekend in May. Absolutely loved it. The location is fabulous - just a couple of minutes walk from the sea, which I could see from the window in the top floor studio.
The apartment was spotlessly clean and comfortable with some really lovely touches, but what impressed me most were the owners. The picked me up from the airport and left a cell phone in the apartment in case there was anything I needed to call them for.
Overall, it was a really tremendous experience.",May 2017,Apartments Magdalena,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295370-d3700639-Reviews-Apartments_Magdalena-Split_Split_Dalmatia_County_Dalmatia.html,"Split, Croatia",hotels,5.0,5.0
Fresh & delicious!,"Great food, great wine, fabulous service! Loved this place and wish I could go back for more! Any time you get the catch of the day brought to you to choose from, you know it's super fresh.

Beautiful!,"I had a great stay in this stunning and wonderfully located hotel!
The view was incredible, the room was clean and comfortable, and the service generally was so good I wouldn't be surprised if they'd managed to arrange the fabulous weather :)
The spa is well worth a visit, and the restaurant is fab.
I just have two small things to note.
1. The walls of my bedroom were quite thin, which was a bit of an issue because there was a baby in the next room who had a great set of lungs! Luckily he was quiet at night, otherwise I wouldn't have got any sleep
2. Be careful if you go for the option where you get dinner included. I did this, and was not told either on checkin, or when I went to the restaurant, that this was limited to certain items on the menu. I have absolutely no objection to that, and the food was really great there, but I did get a surprise when I checked out and saw the bill. So if you do get the option with dinner included, do what I didn't, and ask what that entails :)
Generally though, it was a very relaxing stay and I will definitely be going back again!!",October 2016,Kopieniec Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g652073-d8639826-Reviews-Kopieniec_Hotel-Murzasichle_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Murzasichle, Poland",hotels,4.0,4.5
City center relaxation!,"I live in Krakow so have been here quite a few times. Every time I leave relaxed and happy! They do a great mani/pedi, face treatments are great, and the massages are the perfect way to get rid of any stress!
Staff are super nice and professional and they don't oversell their products as much as other places I've been to. They give good advice and guidance, but without the pressure, which for me means I'm more likely to buy their take-home products, and have a few times to great effect!

Excellent customer service and location,"I picked this hotel for a short trip to Wroclaw (from Krakow) because the reviews were fab and it absolutely did not disappoint. Location could not be beaten, and the room was clean, cosy and very comfortable. The staff were also fantastic and very helpful throughout the couple of days I was there.
It's also worth noting that one of the nights I was there, the hotel hosted a wedding. My room was on the first floor, but I did not hear a thing through the night, although next morning it certainly looked like the guests enjoyed themselves!
Since coming back, I have recommended this hotel to others and will definitely stay there again when I return to Wroclaw.",May 2015,Art Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274812-d286456-Reviews-Art_Hotel-Wroclaw_Lower_Silesia_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Wroclaw, Poland",hotels,5.0,4.5
