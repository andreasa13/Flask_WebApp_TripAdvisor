Stunning,This is a must see if you have any interest in history or architecture or just a love of beautiful things. It is well worth the trek up the hill and the potential crowds just to be near this magnificent example of ancient architecture and culture.,December 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Smaller than Expected,The museum houses some incredible artefacts and is very well laid out with plenty to read about what you were looking at. It was smaller than i expected so you can get round in probably an hour and a half. Some areas you are not permitted to take photographs and staff will remind people of this. The staff were very helpful and knowledgeable as well.,December 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Ancient Glory,I was so excited to visit the Acropolis and i must admit that it did not disappoint. Pictures do not do it justice and you really get a sense of the scale of it by seeing it up close as well as seeing it on the skyline as you approach. It is busy and the locals recommended going early or late to visit. It is quite a steep climb up so be prepared with suitable footwear. My one regret is not taking a guided tour as i feel i would have learnt so much more.,December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Comfortable, convenient and charming","Visited the hotel for three nights immediately following Christmas and it was perfect for our trip in so many reasons. The service upon arrival was excellent. We had encountered a problem in that a car was meant to meet us at the airport but it hadn't turned up so we had to get a taxi. The hotel arranged our transport back and reduced the price due to the inconvenience of the trip going out, the staff were apologetic, decisive and pleasant in the way they dealt with it. The room itself was comfortable and we had a good view of the Acropolis even though we weren't in the rooms classed as having and Acropolis view. The gym was conveniently located on our floor and was very good for a hotel gym. Breakfast was fabulous with a wide variety of choice of freshly cooked food and other options for all tastes, the view from the restaurant is gorgeous. The hotel is conveniently located near the hop on hop off bus stops so is ideal for getting to a variety of the major locations for a short stay in Athens. There are restaurants around the hotel so there is plenty of choice of places to eat as well. We would definitely come back!",December 2019,Wyndham Grand Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d10961869-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
"Great atmosphere, service and charm.","This restaurant was located conveniently next to our hotel and when we had peered in at diners whilst walking around we decided it definitely looked like a place for us. The staff were fantastic, polite and quick service and whilst we personally didn't ask too much of them we could see them expertly handling large groups and customers that had a lot of enquiries. The food was well prepared and delicious and the portion sizes were more than adequate. If we had more time we would definitely have visited again.",December 2019,Alexander the Great Greek Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1076442-Reviews-Alexander_the_Great_Greek_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A little taste of Greece!,"I had already read the positive reviews for this restaurant before visiting as i had searched for places to eat near our hotel. I hadnt realised just how close the location was to the hotel being situated literally across the road from the front doors so not only was it conveniently located we found it to be excellent in many ways. We visited on the first night of our stay and loved the decor inside as well as the two musicians playing traditional Greek music. Choosing what to eat proved difficult because the choice was broad and seeing the food come out the dishes looked delicious. We decided to get the grill sharing platter and quite frankly it was beautiful i think i could have eaten it on my own.The staff were friendly, service was quick, drinks were nicely chilled and as said before the food was amazing, so good in fact that we returned again for our third and final night of our visit to Athens.",December 2019,MIRONI Greek Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14072280-Reviews-MIRONI_Greek_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Breathtaking,"Really enjoyed the coach trip to the Temple as got to see some beautiful coastline and some gorgeous seaside towns. Upon first seeing the temple you can understand why the location was chosen by the Ancient Greeks as a place to worship the God of the Ocean. The temple itself is very well preserved and a really good example to explore. To look around it doesn't take long but it is well worth the trip out to see it. The views over the Aegean are stunning as well and whilst our visit was a little chilly i can imagine that sunset in the warmer months must be incredible. The gift shop, cafe and toilet facilities are all well kept, reasonably priced and suitably located as you walk to the car park. This is a must see if you're staying in the area.",December 2019,Temple of Poseidon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562628-d312283-Reviews-Temple_of_Poseidon-Sounio_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Sounio, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Lovely walk,Walked through the green on a very pleasant Autumn day and nearly forgot we were in the heart of England. The architecture is very grand and gives the feel of a city bigger than Bristol and it is well worth tourists taking a look.,October 2019,College Green,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186220-d2312845-Reviews-College_Green-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Tripadvisor took us there!,"After using Tripadviser to find restaurants near to our hotel this was the one we decided on due to the good reviews and the proximity. We were not disappointed.

Perfect Location,"This hotel provided us with the perfect location for our weekend in Bristol. It was 10 minute walk from Temple Meads train station and then 10 minutes the other way to the centre of town and the theatre which was the main purpose of our trip. Reasonably priced, very clean and comfortable and excellent customer service we would definitely choose this hotel again if we were staying in the city.",October 2019,Premier Inn Bristol City Centre (Finzels Reach) hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186220-d12789401-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Bristol_City_Centre_Finzels_Reach_hotel-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
"Wonderful meal, generous portions!","We visited this pub whilst staying over the road at the Knights Village and it is ideally situated for anyone staying there. There was a broad selection of food on the menu and drinks behind the bar and all were reasonably priced when you consider the pub could be classed as being in a tourist hotspot. When our food arrived we were both overwhelmed by the portion sizes, particularly the amount of chips that came with the burger. It was quite a busy pub but it was Friday night and the atmosphere was great.",September 2019,The Racehorse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186400-d2385664-Reviews-The_Racehorse-Warwick_Warwickshire_England.html,"Warwick, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.5
An excellent stay with fantastic service.,Ive always been intrigued by the prospect of staying at the Knights Village as i visit the castle a couple of times a year at least for work and walk past the village. When a groupon came up i jumped at the chance. We stayed in one of the tents and like some of the other reviews have said it can get chilly at this time of the year but we had packed accordingly as suggested in the literature provided by the venue before arrival. The entertainment seemed good particularly for children and for adults their is enough to keep you occupied as well. We did not eat in the evening instead choosing to walk out to one of the local pubs. The wifi is good if you need it and the breakfast in the morning was very good. One of the highlights for us was the ability to get drinks 24 hours a day from the restaurant and if you were with a tent of 4 you could nearly get your money back just on that perk. The castle was fantastic as always and overall this was a great weekend. The customer service staff we found to be delightful and everyone who dealt with us seemed to go out of their way to make our stay perfect.,September 2019,Warwick Castle Knight's Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186400-d10407235-Reviews-Warwick_Castle_Knight_s_Village-Warwick_Warwickshire_England.html,"Warwick, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
Impressive and immense,Having seen the square on TV numerous times you really dont get an idea of the scale of it and just how intricately decorated the area is. We werent lucky enough to visit on a day where the Pope addresses the crowd but i can only imagine what it must be like with that volume of individuals there to greet him. Amazing architecture.,August 2019,St. Peter's Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187793-d191109-Reviews-St_Peter_s_Square-Vatican_City_Lazio.html,"Vatican City, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Mesmerising,"I could have stood in awe and studied this room for days, i was lucky to get a spot in the middle of the room and was able to get a sense of the work that must have gone in to creating this masterpiece.

Wonderful but overcrowded,"I cant give this experience any less than 5 stars on the rating as it is an incredible collection of art works and historical pieces BUT this was by far the most crowded and busiest part of our visit to Rome. In some areas the corridors were just full with tours and it was impossible to stop and look at the pieces in any kind of detail, you just felt like you were being taken along by a sea of humanity. It was also incredibly hot and as per instructions i had worn a shirt and trousers for the day so was even hotter than normal. That is not to say that what is on offer to see here is amazing and the Sistine Chapel is worth braving the hoard for in itself. Definitely invest in the skip the line tickets!",August 2019,Vatican Museums,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187793-d191000-Reviews-Vatican_Museums-Vatican_City_Lazio.html,"Vatican City, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful but busy!,"The steps are obviously iconic and a must see if in Rome but it was incredibly busy and what was more annoying was the hoards of gentlemen attempting to palm roses off on us, they were persistent to say the least. The architecture is impressive and it has featured in such iconic movies that it is an experience to visit but it was not my favourite attraction in Rome. The whistling of the security also seemed to be at its most prevalent here as well even compared to the Trevi Fountain, there were a lot of confused faces from people attempting to sit on the steps and having whistles blown at them!",August 2019,Spanish Steps,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d197717-Reviews-Spanish_Steps-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.0
A shock to the senses,"As a huge fan Roman mythology the Trevi Fountain was always high on my list of must sees if i ever travelled to Rome but it is so much bigger and more impressive in person than it appears on film or in pictures. It almost sneaks up on you as you enter the square from a small side street to be presented by this huge construction that is just breathtaking! It is of course very busy and security use their whistles liberally to remind tourists not to sit on the edge, dip their hands in the water etc. A must see!",August 2019,Trevi Fountain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190131-Reviews-Trevi_Fountain-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Like being in a movie,"After a fairly hefty walk trying to find this square (our fault not Rome's) we entered the area and immediatley got the sense that this is the Rome you see in films! Surrounded by restaurants and balconies adorned with foliage, thousands of tourists and a wonderful fountain of the god Neptune this was how you imagine Rome to be. We were warned against pickpockets in this area but there is a high security presence and unlike some of the other areas we weren't harassed by street vendors or the like.

Beautiful and Majestic,"Simply the views from atop the hill are worth the trip in alone but then when presented with the historical ruins, beautiful gardens and impressive fountains as well it makes the trip even more rewarding. Once again the free drinking water came in handy as it was a very hot and dusty experience. Note that some areas require a further ticket to enter so check what your admission ticket allows before visiting.",August 2019,Palatine Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190996-Reviews-Palatine_Hill-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
A hot and historical wander!,"The forum is so grand and so varied in its remains but you really get a sense of this as a once bustling community centre as you walk around the various ruins. I felt like there could be more in the way of descriptive placards and whilst there is some they are not overly detailed, maybe a tour guide would be a better option than doing it alone like we did. It is very open and therefore very hot but there are the free water fountains around and some trees to shade under near the opening of the Forum. Well worth a visit.",August 2019,Roman Forum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d2154770-Reviews-Roman_Forum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
I was entertained!,My excitement at simply seeing the Colosseum when driving past was palpable but my experience visiting it topped that feeling. The sheer size and enormity of the structure and the knowledge that it has withstood centuries fills you with wonder. There are plenty of placards around explaining various elements of the structure and its history and i certainly learnt a lot in the concourse museum style areas as well. The fact that admission is limited means that it never really feels crowded but my recommendation would be to buy the skip the queue tickets online before you travel as we walked pretty much straight in whilst others melted in the heat whilst waiting. There is a lot of work taking place at the moment so some areas are not open to the public and i feel a visit in the future will be necessary so i can see the underneath areas too.,August 2019,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
A magical merging of different cultures,"From the front this imposing structure is a wonderful demonstration of Greek style architecture but when inside it becomes a symbol of the Christian faith and equally impressive. look up to the roof to see the opening that at the right times of day is beautiful in itself.

Lovely Hotel,"Booked this hotel for a slightly last minute city break in the summer and was really happy that we did. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable, staff are friendly, helpful and speak excellent English (important for us as ignorantly speak very little Italian!) The gym was adequate for a few nights away just to keep your hand in and the rooftop pool area is lovely after a morning of sight seeing in the very hot and dusty city. A word of caution with the pool which i wish id known before travelling though is that you are required to wear a swimming cap and they are quite strict with this. They are available to buy at the hotel but if you have one take it with you. We didn't eat at the hotel but the food certainly looks high quality and whilst there is a large selection of drinks at the bar they were quite expensive.The hotel is quite far out from the main attractions of Rome and you must use public transport to access them, this can be quite confusing to start with in the sense that the bus tickets are purchased from local newsagents and tobacco shops as opposed to on the bus themselves and you have to remember to scan them when you get on the bus. The route in to the city itself is about 20 minutes and the busses go regularly from very early in the morning to quite late in the evening. Once we got our bearings this was no problem and the hotel more than suited our needs for this wonderful stay.",August 2019,H10 Roma Citta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d1145313-Reviews-H10_Roma_Citta-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
Fantastic Anniversary Treat,"My wife treated me to a meal here in July (on the hottest day of the year!!!) and we had a wonderful three course meal that was presented as you would expect at a restaurant with this reputation and tasted superb. We sampled some of the cocktails beforehand as well that were on and these were delicious, reasonably priced and quite strong. The decor and the service are top notch and my only ""complaint"" on this particular day was that there didnt seem to be any air conditioning, i may be wrong due to extreme city temperature that was going on outside but either way i was very warm. Excellent treat and will definitely come back!",July 2019,Purnell's Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186402-d785556-Reviews-Purnell_s_Restaurant-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Aquarium,Upon entering the very beautiful 1920s style building you get the sense that this is going to be a small aquarium but as you continue to move through it is surprisingly large and has a variety of species to wonder at. It is a beautiful well kept aquarium and when we visited in June it was quiet and you could take your time observing the creatures not feeling rushed or pushed out of the way like we have experienced at some venues. I would definitely visit again.,June 2019,Aquarium de Biarritz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187080-d266601-Reviews-Aquarium_de_Biarritz-Biarritz_Basque_Country_Pyrenees_Atlantiques_Nouvelle_Aquitai.html,"Biarritz, France",attractions,5.0,4.0
A Mythical Visit,"This is both an amazing example of the beauty of nature but also a trip in to Greek history and mythology. The climb up is quite taxing actually particularly depending on the heat but once you arrive at the cave it is well worth it. The descent down in to the cave is awe inspiring and you can really see why the ancients viewed this as a place of mythology and spiritual importance. Once back down the hill there are plenty of little tourist shops and places to eat and drink. Well worth the jaunt up the hill, wear good shoes!",August 2019,Cave Of Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1010310-d4885220-Reviews-Cave_Of_Zeus-Anogia_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Lovely modern bar,We took a walk to this bar specifically on the recommendation of some friends from our hotel who raved about the food and drinks here. We weren't disappointed. The staff were incredibly welcoming and actually apologised that they hadn't been able to spend more time talking with us as they were so busy. There was an ample selection of drinks and the gin selection was particularly impressive. Big screen TVs showing sport were on as was decent music selection.,August 2019,Juniper Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608862-d17634939-Reviews-Juniper_Bar-Sissi_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great fun holiday pub,"Well aside from the fact that this pub was seemingly made for me, pirate themed, Guinness on tap, next to the sea, live music, quizzes (it literally is the pub i would open!) it still impressed us every visit. The fact that the pub was situated so close to our hotel was a bonus but i think if we had been staying further away we would have still waked to go here as it was just always so fun. Staff are great, have fabulous senses of humour and were welcoming every visit. Drinks are reasonably priced (even the dreaded imported Guinness wasn't too expensive) and there was plenty of choice depending on your mood. The quiz nights are a great laugh and are well ran with some generous prizes. As mentioned before the location was actually breathtaking and the breeze near the sea was welcomed after some very hot days. I would happily go back to Sissi just to go back to this pub but luckily the rest of Sissi is great too.",August 2019,The Jolly Roger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608862-d2297861-Reviews-The_Jolly_Roger-Sissi_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

A lovely well cared for beach,The beach is situated in a little almost private cove area and is serviced by a large takeaway/bar/club area that i think must stay open in to the night as a beach bar.

The sea and beach is clean and perfect for swimming and playing.,August 2019,Boufos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608862-d7044201-Reviews-Boufos_Beach-Sissi_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.5

Holiday from Heaven,"This was a beautiful hotel, scenic and relaxing, well maintained and offering exemplary customer service in all areas. The restaurant is five star and the food choices are vast, the waiting staff are all great and we particularly enjoyed our chats with Stavros on a nightly basis. The rooms are immaculate and staff bring water and chocolates to your room every evening as well. When there is entertainment provided it is high quality and enjoyable and the quiz/karaoke night was a particular favourite of ours. The hotels location is ideal to be able to wander around the village or down to the seafront as well as over to the restaurants and bars. We really cant praise this hotel enough and we had the relaxing and fun holiday we had been looking forward to so much. My only recommendations for improvement would be more weight machines or dumbbells in the gym and also some AC in the gym as it is warm whenever you go in, we also felt there could be more evenings of entertainment as this would have made us stay in the hotel more rather than using local pubs etc.",August 2019,Castello Boutique Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608862-d1228109-Reviews-Castello_Boutique_Resort_Spa-Sissi_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Still the best!,When we unexpectedly booked a last minute holiday to Costa Teguise the one thing i demanded that we do was visit Jesters again and i wasn't let down. Still full of charm and good fun it really is the best bar around. The staff are so friendly and even remembered us from 5 years ago and we immediately felt welcome. Everyone seems to be having a good time and the atmosphere just helps you as an individual to get more involved and have a great night.

Excellent Family Hotel,"Recently visited during the potentially busy half term week and was a little wary as haven't done a family hotel for very long time. Dropped off after the very short transfer from the airport and the exterior and lobby area are all impressive and welcoming, our room wasn't quite ready yet but we were given our wristbands so could get a drink and something to eat whilst we waited. When the room was ready we were pleased with it as we had a lovely view of the sea and the room is clean and comfortable. It is fairly basic but there is a fridge for drinks and a TV and the beds are clean so what more do you need. The pools and surrounding area are clean and well kept and it was fairly easy to get beds though some do reserve them very early in the morning it seemed The food was great and there was a good variety available at all three sittings. Staff work hard and are friendly and welcoming but we felt the dining room may benefit from guests being seated as it is a bit of a free for all and staff have to work extra hard to get tables cleared. The entertainments team were great and there seemed to be a lot on offer for all ages. In the evening the bar queue can sometimes get a little long but it does die down when the children's entertainment finishes and there are more tables and chairs available then too. The gym is pretty basic particularly for those who like to lift weights but the cable machine and the dumbbells were sufficient to keep your hand in for a weeks break.The town is about a 30minute walk along the coast or down the road and we ventured in twice during the week and got a taxi back which was under 5 euro. All in all we were really happy with our break and would definitely return particularly with a family as the facilities for children seemed great.",May 2019,Occidental Lanzarote Playa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g659633-d234400-Reviews-Occidental_Lanzarote_Playa-Costa_Teguise_Lanzarote_Canary_Islands.html,"Lanzarote, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.0

Broad Range of Animals,We visited the zoo in the holidays to actually take part in one of their keeper programs with the orang-utans which was absolutely incredible but aside from that 45 minute experience we visited the zoo as regular visitors.

Ideal for a short break in London,I booked this hotel due to its relatively close proximity to the Olympia as we were attending the London Film and Comicon on the Saturday so we thought we may as well make a weekend out of it.

A long day but well worth it!,Many of the reviews here complain about the length of time spent at the Canyon in relation to the amount of time spent on the coach and whilst the journey is a long one it would also be long if you decided to drive from Vegas and back yourselves in a day to the South Rim. The fact that our coach driver was so knowledgeable about a multitude of areas on the journey added to the experience I felt and provided me with a guided tour of the very interesting landscape en route to the destination. The Canyon itself needs no review as it is simple breath-taking. The two stops on the way were welcome inclusions at the relevant stages of the journey and the buffet lunch was perfectly adequate for the cost providing a good choice and pretty quick service.

Better than Expected,"From reading the reviews on Tripadvisor I must admit to being a little concerned that id booked a dud for our recent trip to Vegas. Having been to Vegas before and having the privilege of staying in some of the top resorts I was aware that the price paid for this stay would be reflected in the differences between say the Venetian and here. What I can now say is that we were pleasantly surprised by the Excalibur and had no complaints over our 5 day stay at the resort. Check in was quick and painless and whilst we arrived way too early for our room we were able to leave our bags with some incredibly helpful staff. Staff around the resort greeted us always with enthusiasm and a smile and are a credit to the resort. Our room was clean, comfortable ad had a great view of the strip including New York New York and the MGM Grand. The gym facilities were excellent and the equipment was modern and in a nice setting overlooking the pool in the hotels spa. The food court had a great choice of dining options meaning you didn't need to leave the resort to find that breakfast muffin or late evening chicken dish you need. The buffet was excellent and we benefited from some vouchers from the MLife rewards program, without these it may be considered a little pricey. The various bars in the resort were great, staffed by friendly knowledgeable bartenders and I personally enjoyed the karaoke night at the lounge. The pool is well staffed and clean and sun loungers were relatively easy to come by depending on what time of day you arrived to the area.

A long day but well worth it!,Many of the reviews here complain about the length of time spent at the Canyon in relation to the amount of time spent on the coach and whilst the journey is a long one it would also be long if you decided to drive from Vegas and back yourselves in a day to the South Rim. The fact that our coach driver was so knowledgeable about a multitude of areas on the journey added to the experience I felt and provided me with a guided tour of the very interesting landscape en route to the destination. The Canyon itself needs no review as it is simple breath-taking. The two stops on the way were welcome inclusions at the relevant stages of the journey and the buffet lunch was perfectly adequate for the cost providing a good choice and pretty quick service. I actually appreciated the various films and videos shown on the coach as I felt it made the trip go quicker particularly on the way back.,April 2018,Grand Canyon Tour Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d1637112-Reviews-Grand_Canyon_Tour_Company-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,4.0,4.0
Belly Busting Brilliance,"The first time in a long time that I had felt seriously beaten by a meal once id finished it. There was a little bit of a wait for a table but the Atlantis show is just outside so that killed some time as did a wander round the shops nearby. Once inside the atmosphere was great and our server was wonderful. The food was delicious and reasonably priced with an excellent portion size, I forced myself to have a cheesecake as ive visited before and not had one which seems silly considering the name of the restaurant. It was delicious and I swear my wife became emotional with joy over her selection. Will be happy to visit again.",April 2018,The Cheesecake Factory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d492036-Reviews-The_Cheesecake_Factory-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Better than Expected,"From reading the reviews on Tripadvisor I must admit to being a little concerned that id booked a dud for our recent trip to Vegas. Having been to Vegas before and having the privilege of staying in some of the top resorts I was aware that the price paid for this stay would be reflected in the differences between say the Venetian and here. What I can now say is that we were pleasantly surprised by the Excalibur and had no complaints over our 5 day stay at the resort. Check in was quick and painless and whilst we arrived way too early for our room we were able to leave our bags with some incredibly helpful staff. Staff around the resort greeted us always with enthusiasm and a smile and are a credit to the resort. Our room was clean, comfortable ad had a great view of the strip including New York New York and the MGM Grand. The gym facilities were excellent and the equipment was modern and in a nice setting overlooking the pool in the hotels spa. The food court had a great choice of dining options meaning you didn't need to leave the resort to find that breakfast muffin or late evening chicken dish you need. The buffet was excellent and we benefited from some vouchers from the MLife rewards program, without these it may be considered a little pricey. The various bars in the resort were great, staffed by friendly knowledgeable bartenders and I personally enjoyed the karaoke night at the lounge. The pool is well staffed and clean and sun loungers were relatively easy to come by depending on what time of day you arrived to the area. We would certainly stay at the Excalibur again and it is ideal if you're looking for a less expensive but still authentic Vegas experience.",April 2018,Excalibur Hotel & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d97786-Reviews-Excalibur_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,5.0,3.5
Excellent Customer Service,"The hotel is in a fantastic location for exploring downtown and having accessibility to the BART and the cable cars to get around to some of the tourist destinations and the airport. As well as that it is conveniently located near Union Square and all the restaurants, shops and attractions. The staff were fantastic here giving you a warm welcome every time you walked through the door or out of the lift. My wife particularly enjoyed the complimentary champagne provided for a few hours early evening. The rooms were clean and comfortable and plenty big enough for a city break and the gym was surprisingly well equipped for a small hotel gym we found we were able to have a decent workout. The only downside to the hotel is the level of noise at night outside BUT it is to be expected in a busy city centre location like this. We would definitely stay again.",April 2018,Hotel Diva,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d112303-Reviews-Hotel_Diva-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",hotels,5.0,4.0
An exhausting but breath-taking bike ride,"We chose to hire bikes to ride across the bridge and back and whilst I was exhausted after the 10 mile round trip the 2 miles of the bridge itself are breath-taking in terms of the views and also the adrenaline rush of the being so high on such a busy bridge. Bikes are separated from the main traffic so there is no concern there but there were some ""pro bikers"" that can be a little intimidating as they whizz past you. The ride to and from the bridge is also incredible with scenery you cant describe and it was well worth the pain of the bike ride to see it.",April 2018,Golden Gate Bridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d104675-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Bridge-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
An atmospheric experience like no other!,Alcatraz impressed on so many levels and it was lovely to learn that the island was more than just a top security prison. The audio guide tour really immerses you in the stories of the prison both its inmates and its staff and they have done a really good job in leaving the island untouched and as it was as opposed to making it tourist friendly. I was amazed at the additional things I learnt about the island and left with a sense of awe and wonder about the place. The ferry trip over gives you some fantastic views of the city and the bridges and is a great experience.

A fun way to get around,Just being on the cars is an experience in itself and after walking up some of the hills they travel up and down a necessary one if you want to save your legs. The cond. The conductors all seemed lively and fun and as though they enjoyed their jobs and they make the journeys an even better experience. The lines to get on down by the ticket office were really long so I suggest walking up the hill a little to get on.,April 2018,Cable Cars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d104821-Reviews-Cable_Cars-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
Tourists Dream,Only spent an afternoon here but there was plenty to see and do and eat for much longer visits. Obviously a very tourist driven area but sometimes that what you want and need. The sealions are wonderful to watch and you could spend all day just doing that im sure. Great shops for your tourist gifts and actually found them to be reasonably priced as well as were the restaurants etc.,April 2018,Pier 39,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d102779-Reviews-Pier_39-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.0
Scenic and bustling,A great location and easy to get to using the cable cars there are a great selection of restaurants and attractions with beautiful views of the Golden Gate bridge and the coast in general. We hardly scratched the surface of what there was here to do in an afternoon so you could probably make a day of it. We hired our bikes for the Golden Gate bridge ride from here but bear in mind it is 3 miles still to the bridge and a lot of that is uphill.,April 2018,Fisherman's Wharf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d108678-Reviews-Fisherman_s_Wharf-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.0
Great Views and Great Staff,The views from the top of Mount Diablo are breath-taking being able to see San Francisco the sea one way and the snow capped mountains the other way it was just spectacular. The staff at the gift shop and the rangers were all incredibly friendly and helpful and really seemed to love their park. You need to be a confident driver to handle the roads up and being aware of the cyclists is a must as there seems to be a lot of them and they seem to have no concern for their own well-being.,April 2018,Mount Diablo State Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32217-d117270-Reviews-Mount_Diablo_State_Park-Clayton_California.html,"Clayton, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Comfortable, reasonably priced short stay","Visited during half term holidays and spent 3 nights here. Was really pleased with the room and whilst the TV wasn't working when we arrived they sorted it within ten minutes. The fitness suite is great as far as hotel gyms go and the pool area looked lovely. The benefit of staying here is also the location of the park and ride which gets you in to Chester cheaply and regularly and is located literally next to the hotel. The hotel is old fashioned in some areas but appears to be undergoing modernisation and the entrance area, bar and function areas are all modern and new looking. There is a nice pub/restaurant over the road that is Harvester like but not and there are takeaways and shops a 5 minute ride away in the car. Ideal location for driving to the zoo as well.",October 2017,Mercure Chester Abbots Well Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186233-d244527-Reviews-Mercure_Chester_Abbots_Well_Hotel-Chester_Cheshire_England.html,"Chester, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,3.5
A Lovely Way to Spend a Day,Having visited San Diego Zoo I always have high expectations of these kinds of attractions and Chester Zoo did not disappoint. A day here easily flew by with the number of attractions available and an incredibly wide array of animals all seemingly happy and cared for and enjoying their lives at the zoo. The new area with the boat ride and the indoor orang-utan viewing area is really well done and very American theme park influenced. We truly enjoyed our day here immensely.,October 2017,Chester Zoo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186233-d213872-Reviews-Chester_Zoo-Chester_Cheshire_England.html,"Chester, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5

Walking in the steps of the Romans,I love attractions like this and you really get a sense of the scale of the walls and their usage over periods of history. There are signs around explaining key areas and points of history but aside from that the views across the river and around the city are worth walking the walls for alone.,October 2017,Chester City Walls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186233-d15330479-Reviews-Chester_City_Walls-Chester_Cheshire_England.html,"Chester, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
A samll glimpse of a Roman Way of Life,Whilst the gardens are only small they are incredibly beautiful and informative as well. I was delighted to hear a parent explaining to his young daughter how the under floor heating would have worked and the little girl was able to go up to the remains of the system and see the various elements her dad was explaining. I can imagine that in the summer this area is even more attractive to tourists as it allows an area to sit in a picturesque environment.,October 2017,Chester Roman Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186233-d4660284-Reviews-Chester_Roman_Gardens-Chester_Cheshire_England.html,"Chester, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0

FINALLY i got to the home of Guinness,"After 5 previous visits to Dublin including one where we stayed in an Air bnb directly behind the storehouse and after keeping Guinness in business for about 4 years I finally got to visit the home of my favourite tipple. We used the Dublin Pass for entry and I can honestly say that this along with the bus rides, 4 other attractions visited, airport coach and free Irish coffee in a restaurant, was the most cost effective way of spending a weekend in Dublin and getting to visit the storehouse. The attraction is very entertaining and I enjoyed every floor of the experience from start to finish. Staff are friendly and seem to really enjoy their jobs. The bar is reasonably priced which shocked me with it being smack back in a tourist attraction. When we visited the gift shop again we were pleasantly shocked at the reasonable and realistic prices for the items available as well as the huge range to suit all ages. We spent around 3 hours here but you could definitely stay longer with some of the bar areas being very inviting for a few drinks, or ten!

Great fun but very pricey and very crowded,"Temple Bar is a must see for your trip to Dublin but we found on this occasion, our 6th trip here, that actually the beer is overpriced compared to what you can get in pubs a few streets away, and that it was incredibly busy in the bars. There are tons of stag and hen parties around and you are ensured a lively night out but maybe im getting old as I preferred a sit down in a bar listening to some good music. Still its well worth a visit and definitely a must for those seeking lively nightlife.",October 2017,Temple Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d188821-Reviews-Temple_Bar-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,4.0,4.0

Loved this Attraction,Whilst this tour is much smaller than the Guinness factory it was still full of fun. the tour guides are passionate and knowledgeable and the taste testing provided us with an ample amount of whiskey to sample. the bar area was really fun as well and had a great atmosphere.

Irish food and plenty of it!,"Convinced to go here by our American friend who proudly stated it was the only thing he had to do whilst we visited Dublin for a few days. We were not disappointed.
