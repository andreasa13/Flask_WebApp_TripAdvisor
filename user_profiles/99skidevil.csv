Beautiful seaside sites,"La Jolla Cove is a the real deal. An incredibly beautiful setting with luxurious La Jolla on the hill and the natural beauty of sea at your feet. Enjoy the endless charm of the sea lions and seals as they constantly bark and attempt to be 'king of the hill'. Just don't get too close, Not only will they give chase, the life guards will to. The beach is small, but the cove is where the action is - get out and snorkel - not only will you see seals up close, you may also see some sea turtles, exotic fish, and even the occasional dolphin.",April 2017,La Jolla Cove,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32578-d255307-Reviews-La_Jolla_Cove-La_Jolla_San_Diego_California.html,"La Jolla, California",attractions,5.0,4.5

The Nutcraker,"I had never been to the Dolby Theater as it has been well over a decade since the last time I was in Hollywood. I must say - I was blown away. The Hollywood & Highland center is amazing on it's own, but the theater is simply superb. My girlfriend and I were attending the Nutcracker prior to Christmas and we both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Although we were seated on the second level in the center, there didn't appear to be a bad seat in the house. The acoustics and lighting are fantastic. I highly recommend attending a show at the Dolby Theater.",December 2016,Dolby Theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32655-d266292-Reviews-Dolby_Theatre-Los_Angeles_California.html,"Los Angeles, California",attractions,5.0,4.0
Find Greatness at the Getty Center,"First, I'm an architect and find the Getty Center itself to be a work of art. However, don't miss the 'real' art - that is on display within this fabulous facility. You name it, they have it - from ancient art to modern, including everything in between. And you won't be disappointed - there are indeed great works by some of the Masters.",December 2016,The Getty Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32655-d147966-Reviews-The_Getty_Center-Los_Angeles_California.html,"Los Angeles, California",attractions,5.0,5.0
One of Gerhy's greatest.,"I live in near San Diego and I made it a point to visit the Walt Disney Concert Hall after moving here from Phoenix. During a recent trip to Los Angeles, I was able to fit it in to a Saturday morning. What a piece of art this building indeed is! I explored all sides and even spent a little time inside.

Exceptional hotel,"My girl friend and I spent one (1) night here while driving the coast. What a find! A reasonable price, very good amenities, and an exceptional location.

Great amenities and location,"I enjoy Hampton Inn & Suites and consider it a highly consistent brand that offers superior accommodations and amenities for the price. This particular location was brand new and still under construction during my stay. Nevertheless, there were no circumstances as a result of the construction that were an inconvenience or a distraction. I suspect that upon final completion of the hotel, this location will be yet another fine example of Hampton Inn & Suites' product.",October 2016,Hampton Inn & Suites Los Angeles - Glendale,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32431-d10352909-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Los_Angeles_Glendale-Glendale_California.html,"Glendale, California",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Great Hotel, exceptional location","I found the Hilton Irvine/Orange County-Airport to be incredibly clean and modern, in an exceptional location within Orange County.

Wonderful overnight stay,I was in the Anaheim area for only one night and chose the Hilton Anaheim because of it's location and value. The hotel is well designed and very well maintained.
