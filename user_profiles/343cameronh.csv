Beautiful building and fantastic pub meal,We booked in advance due to current Covid 19 restrictions and glad we did! I had very high expectations as this was my first pub experience in over 3 months and I certainly wasn’t disappointed. The serving was massive and I regretted getting an entree when my main come out (just cause there was so much food!). If you’re driving make sure you pay attention to the standard drinks per glass of wine (very generous!!). Staff were incredibly friendly and they obviously take their Covid 19 safety seriously as there was 1 staff member working solely on cleaning (I saw him wipe the entry door every time someone used it). I had the Parma for my main (amazing) and my partner had the chicken breast (also yum). Would definitely eat here again!,June 2020,Hotel Warrnambool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255363-d2712275-Reviews-Hotel_Warrnambool-Warrnambool_Victoria.html,"Warrnambool, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Partners meal was nice,We chose to eat at Pippies by the Bay for our first night in Warrnambool as the photos online looked really nice. The restaurant itself was pleasant and the tables were nice and spaced out due to current Covid 19 restrictions. We shared a starter (chargrilled sourdough with olive oil and balsamic) which was nice and then my partner had the duck for his main and I had the lamb. My partner loved the duck but I found the lamb to be really bland and lacking any seasoning or flavour. Definite highlight for me was the dessert (passion fruit pannacotta) which was well plated. Ok dining experience but we had nicer (and cheaper) meals elsewhere.,June 2020,Pippies by the Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255363-d737537-Reviews-Pippies_by_the_Bay-Warrnambool_Victoria.html,"Warrnambool, Australia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Ok breakfast but venue left a lot to be desired,Booked in advance for breakfast seeing the photos on TripAdvisor of the views from upstairs. Unfortunately we were told we were being seated downstairs which obviously wasn’t part of the restaurant and just a room off the kiosk that was being used to get around the 20 people per space limits with Covid 19. The room looked more like a utility room with a few tables in it than a restaurant and there were groups of surfers outside getting undressed. Quite off putting. The coffee was served in a takeaway cup and the poached eggs were over-cooked. Very friendly staff but we had cheaper breakfasts elsewhere that were better quality in Warrnambool. Also I counted 24 people seated at one point when it clearly said on the door 20 people limit. The wait staff was the only redeeming quality of the place but I wouldn’t bother coming back if I was in Warrnambool again.,June 2020,Pavilion Cafe & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255363-d2685876-Reviews-Pavilion_Cafe_Bar-Warrnambool_Victoria.html,"Warrnambool, Australia",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Wonderful breakfast and fantastic staff.,It’s very obvious why Bohemia Cafe and Bar is number 1 on trip advisor for food in Warrnambool. We booked in advance for breakfast on the Sunday and we weren’t disappointed. The staff were friendly and the food was great. The team take their Covid 19 safety very seriously and we never felt at risk with staff ensuring they were staying within the 20 people limit inside. We enjoyed everything so much we made a booking for the next day so we could enjoy the food and service before we headed home. One of the staff members asked where we were from and said she wished we were local because she wanted us to be her new favourite regulars. We felt so comfortable! Would highly recommend Bohemia Cafe and Bar (but would suggest booking as it’s a very popular place!),June 2020,Bohemia Cafe and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255363-d2519190-Reviews-Bohemia_Cafe_and_Bar-Warrnambool_Victoria.html,"Warrnambool, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Ok hotel with no complaints but nothing to write home about,Stayed at this hotel due to its close proximity to family in Bognor Regis and while I didn’t have any complaints it’s a fairly basic hotel. We stayed in one of the more expensive rooms and found the room design fairly pokey and small and the sea view is out of a side window rather than directly facing the sea. That being said the front of house staff were incredibly friendly and everyone working there smiled and said hello if they passed you. We ate in the restaurant downstairs on our last night and all bar 1 person in our party of 4 enjoyed their meal. There were a few small sitting areas downstairs that some people seemed to enjoy sitting in and talking to each other but we didn’t utilise this at all. The key system was good with us being able to get into the front door once everything was locked up without having to call a night manager. Would more than likely stay here again if we come back to Bognor to see family.,October 2019,Best Western Beachcroft Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1576850-d595996-Reviews-Best_Western_Beachcroft_Hotel-Felpham_Bognor_Regis_Arun_District_West_Sussex_England.html,"Felpham, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.5
Great hotel in good area,Very cute hotel with a lot of artwork on its walls. We were warmly greeted by the front desk and found all the staff to be very friendly on our stay. Well situated to walk everywhere we wanted to in Vienna and really enjoyed having a nightcap in the hotel bar each night before we retired to bed. The hotel supplied us an adaptor for our iPhone so that we could stream Netflix to the smart tv which was nice after a few weeks of travelling in non English speaking countries and we just wanted to chill one night. Organised a taxi for us and like everywhere in austria was very efficient. Only complaint I had as a smoker was that there wasn’t an ashtray out the front and I had to walk onto the street to put my butts in the bin (minor pain point though). The hotel offer a lot of recommendations on where to eat which helped us pick restaurants for dinner. Would definitely return but would spend the extra money to get a room that included a balcony.,October 2019,Boutiquehotel Das Tyrol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190454-d577354-Reviews-Boutiquehotel_Das_Tyrol-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",hotels,5.0,5.0
Great location and friendly staff,We were a little worried about our stay at hotel elefant as some of the reviews on TripAdvisor mentioned a bad trash smell in the hotel and rude staff in the lead up to our stay but our stay was great. Yes there were times we could smell rubbish downstairs in reception and wonder if the trash is held underneath of the lift area however it wasn’t that strong and definitely didn’t smell this all the time. As for the staff. They had a great sense of humour and were always willing to offer assistance and a smile. My favourite was a Croatian woman at reception who had such a dry sense of humour we clicked straight away! The other lady who was on reception was also really helpful and fun and helped in booking a taxi for us before we left for the train station. We booked an executive room which had a seperate living area and was massive for our needs. In the beautiful old town of Salzburg we were able to walk everywhere we needed to and the hotel were happy to look after our bags post check out as we had a tour in the morning. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,October 2019,Hotel Elefant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190441-d19789307-Reviews-Hotel_Elefant-Salzburg_Austrian_Alps.html,"Salzburg, Austria",hotels,5.0,4.5
Amazing meal,We came to this restaurant after seeing some good reviews on TripAdvisor. I noticed a few mentions that tourists were not treated the same as locals but we did not find this at all. We arrived around 8-830pm and were told that there were 3 couples ahead of us waiting for a table but that we were welcome to grab a drink while we waited. We saw no preferential treatment given to anyone and it was fair. The staff on duty were great with their communication and we really enjoyed the wine while we waited. Once we got a table we ordered a potato soup (really nice) which we had with garlic bread (even though this is just shown as an add on with salad). I’d suggest the restaurant add this to the breads selection on the menu as I usually skip reading the salad section on a menu and really enjoyed it. I had a chicken dish that was braised chicken in beer and my partner had a Weiner schnitzel. Both were absolutely amazing. We had room for dessert and shared a mousse. So delicious. We had quite a few laughs with a female staff member working and would definitely recommend this restaurant (though I’d book next time). Looking forward to coming back here when we’re in Salzburg next.,October 2019,Zum fidelen Affen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190441-d1319513-Reviews-Zum_fidelen_Affen-Salzburg_Austrian_Alps.html,"Salzburg, Austria",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great views but make sure you have your walking shoes on,We did fortress hohensalzburg as an add on to seeing the sound of music Abby and the views were amazing however we almost died on the walk up. Very steep inclines on your way up and we were both quite sweaty by the time we got to the top. I wouldn’t recommend this if you don’t have good mobility however we did see a funicular that takes you up and down and sort of wished we’d taken that up and walked down rather than braving the walk both ways. Do yourself a favour and walk to the Abby as there were beautiful views of the snowy mountains in the distance.,October 2019,Fortress Hohensalzburg Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190441-d195077-Reviews-Fortress_Hohensalzburg_Castle-Salzburg_Austrian_Alps.html,"Salzburg, Austria",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good find close to our hotel,For us this was a perfect for our first night in Salzburg as we were tired from having a travel day from Greece. Being a Monday night and 830 the place was pretty quiet and we were put into a room with 3 other 2 seater tables that werent occupied. We really enjoyed the fact it was an old building and the decor of the place. My partner wasn’t sure which red to order and (possibly due to the language barrier slightly) the waiter brought out 2 tastings so my partner could decide. You don’t see that very often so was a lovely touch. We both had the Weiner schnitzel and found it so filling we didn’t end up having dessert. I can see how some reviews said they didn’t feel they got a lot of attention from the wait staff but I felt they checked in just enough to make sure the meal progressed and we appreciated not having staff on top of us.,October 2019,Zum Eulenspiegel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190441-d3618386-Reviews-Zum_Eulenspiegel-Salzburg_Austrian_Alps.html,"Salzburg, Austria",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Partner enjoyed lamb and an amazing view,"Ate here on our first night staying at hotel herodion. Views were amazing but was quite chilly (my mistake for not dressing warmer for a rooftop). Host gave us a bit of attitude when we handed her our free wine voucher and told us we had to hand
It to a waiter and not her. Enjoyed the starter and my partner really enjoyed his lamb main but felt we really had to reach out to the staff to get anything further (had to get staffs attention to get wine rather than them prompting us). When talking to us the staff were fairly friendly and we could charge it back to the hotel room which was a positive.",October 2019,Point a Bar and Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7199752-Reviews-Point_a_Bar_and_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Felt like it was a must do of athend,Amazing views but very disrespectful tourists and incredibly busy. Saw a lot of older people struggle with the uphill walking and the heat of October. Summer would be much harder. Be realistic of your walking ability and understand there is very little shade there. If you’re an Instagram queen please be respectful of others there (lots of staff whistling to get people to do the right thing). Enjoyed it but by the end it was a little same same with the ruins. Lots of walking grounds and wish we went a little earlier. A highlight was a cheeky stray cat we saw there,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Great to see the history and understand the acropolis before you to,Really enjoyed this museum. Pre book your time slot (pre buy your ticket) and do it in the morning. We went about 10am and it was already fairly busy but when we walked past in the afternoon the line to get in was massive. Saw quite a few walking tours there which ruined the experience a little but imagine it would have been a lot worse in the afternoon.,October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good location and pleasant staff,Was greeted by warm staff when we arrived but only wish they had a doorman on duty as we were ripped off by a taxi driver and validation from the hotel staff would have saved us some euro. The website does mention the cost should be 38 euro so make sure you stand your ground with the taxi drivers (or download beat for an honest trip). Had dinner our first night upstairs at point A. My partner really enjoyed his lamb but I wouldn’t rave about the restaurant. The maître d’hôtel was quite stuck up when we handed over our voucher for free wines however to be fair the wines were nice. Room was ok however there was an odd noise we could hear from the room. Realised on the last day it was more than likely the front doors to the hotel opening and closing that we could hear. As a smoker I enjoyed having a small balcony I could smoke on rather than going downstairs. Buffet breakfast was good but the table setup was not appropriate for the clientele as there weren’t enough 2 seater tables. Also not enough fresh juice but plenty of “fruit drink” which people drank while waiting. Had a small meal downstairs and it was massive (club sandwich) which I could easily share with my partner. Not a bad hotel but I wouldn’t rave like other reviews I saw.,October 2019,Herodion Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228864-Reviews-Herodion_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Wanted to give it a 5 but a few things that didn’t fit with a 5 star resort,"Firstly have to talk about the staff. All of the staff at Mykonos blue were amazing except for the gentlemen (we called him smiles) who ran our bags to our room when we first checked in. He did not smile the entire time we were at the resort and saw him. I gave him a 5 euro tip and he couldn’t have been more sarcastic in his thanks to me. Honestly looked like he didn’t like his job and after such a warm greeting we received from other staff it didn’t seem to fit in with the feel Mykonos blue wants to give its customers.

The hotel did go above and beyond with our transfer. We were warmly greeted at the port as we organised transfers both ways. I had emailed the hotel saying a younger traveller was with us but staying at a budget hotel down the road and I had some apprehension leaving her by herself at the port when we were picked up and reception kindly agreed to let her come to the hotel with us in the car. You don’t get that everywhere and meant a lot to the entire party.

Once we arrived we were lead into the bar area for a welcome drink and to finalise the booking. You can tell the staff put a lot of effort into this process as we felt very welcomed (we were yet to meet smiles). We stayed in a bungalow with sea view and although the room was beautiful the bathroom really didn’t scream luxury. The shower is in a bath and didn’t have a freestanding shower head which you would expect in a luxury resort at this price. The shower was a handheld shower that you slotted into something on the wall. It had a giant crack in it as well. It looked really dated and is in desperate need of a renovation.

Breakfast was a buffet but a few things were changed daily and the quality of the food was really good. Found myself going back for seconds both days and it was lovely to start the morning with the views.

We had a late flight out of Mykonos and the hotel gave us full access to all amenities including the spa showers which was a lovely touch after spending the day in the pool. Our transfer to the airport was also punctual and the driver was sincere when he said goodbye to us and wished us a safe journey.

Would I stay at this hotel again. I’m still not sure. It certainly wasn’t a bad hotel or a bad experience. If I knew the bathrooms had been renovated I more than likely would but for that price point I’m sure I could find something with the full 5 star experience (both hotel room and bathroom)",October 2019,Grecotel Mykonos Blu Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1191026-d248968-Reviews-Grecotel_Mykonos_Blu_Hotel-Psarou_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Dinner was great but my friend had a disappointing time the next day,Came here on our final night in Mykonos and found the staff to be friendly (joking around with us) and the food nice. Thought the serving of bread (that you pay for) generous but realised after we left we had been charged 2 times for it so wasn’t as generous as we thought as we paid for it. Everyone enjoyed their mains and we were given a free dessert to share before we left. My friend went back for lunch the next day (there were 3 of us for dinner the night before) and had a completely different experience by herself. She said the staff were completely ignoring her and then being rude to her when she asked for something. Would have given the restaurant a 3 had I taken this into account but didn’t experience it myself when we were there for dinner,October 2019,Avli Tou Thodori,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g659660-d1791041-Reviews-Avli_Tou_Thodori-Platys_Gialos_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great meal and lovely cocktails,Came here on our first night in Mykonos and originally just sat on the chairs by the water having a few cocktails while we decided what we wanted for dinner. This restaurant had been recommended to us by the hotel and found the reviews pretty good on trip advisor so decided to head in for a meal after an hour. Had 2 entrees to share between 3 people and all of us had means. Every single one of us enjoyed our meals! Ended up quite pricy by the end but well worth it. Staff were incredibly friendly and the place gave off a good vibe!,October 2019,Yialo-Yialo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g659660-d3323781-Reviews-Yialo_Yialo-Platys_Gialos_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing restaurant but book or you’ll be having a late dinner!,We found Argo on our first night in Santorini and didn’t have a booking. The earliest we could get in was 10pm and ended up going to a complete tourist trap that we completely regretted after going to Argo and another restaurant during our stay. We booked for 2 nights after our first night in Santorini and the earliest we could get was 8.45pm at night. We we warmly greeted by the staff and given a great table upstairs. Our waitress was bubbly and gave us great recommendations on what to order on the menu. We had 2 starters and a main each. Every single person enjoyed their meal (3 of us in total) and had we spent more time in Santorini would have gone back to try other dishes there. Definitely recommend!,October 2019,Argo Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d1105505-Reviews-Argo_Restaurant-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
All the reviews are right. This hotel is amazing,After seeing all the positive reviews and having 2 Greek friends recommend Enigma Suites we decided to lash out and spend the money on the premium jacuzzi suite. We went as a couple and had a friend stay with us. The layout of the room meant we didn’t feel on top of each other and my friend didn’t feel like she staying in a couples room (though technically she was upstairs above us!). The room. Beautifully renovated and spacious but to be honest we spent more time on the balcony. The sunsets. The view. Easily the best I’ve ever seen. We booked direct and had free transfer to the hotel from the airport and also free transfer to the port when we left. All the staff were friendly and made us feel very welcome. I had a few interactions with Penny via email before we arrived and she made things so easy for us! Penny and Jenny (day and night reception) were so lovely and are such an asset to the suites. Such bubbly personalities and always asking how we were going when we walked through the reception area. Nothing seemed too much for the staff. The included breakfast. Amazing. Such a great spread and delivered to your private balcony every morning at a time of your choice. I honestly can’t say enough good things about this hotel. Do yourself a favour and book this hotel if staying in Santorini. The only problem we had when we left was the fact we were leaving. Easily my highlight of my holiday so far and I can’t thank enigma suites enough.,October 2019,Enigma Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d617597-Reviews-Enigma_Suites-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Beautiful fountain but be prepared for crowds,Absolutely beautiful fountain and must see when in Rome. Very hard to enjoy with the hoards of people there trying to take photos. Tried to be as respectful as we could and get in and out to take our photos. If we came again I’d do my homework and read reviews better to see if there is a time less busy to enjoy it. Probably only spent 5 mins here due to the crowds. Got our photos and got out.,September 2019,Trevi Fountain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190131-Reviews-Trevi_Fountain-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
Tick box when in rome,You can’t come to Rome and not do the colosseum. Unfortunately I left it to late to organise a tour with the official company that sell these with the colosseum but would 100% recommend pre-booking a time slot to attend so that you don’t have to wait in a larger line on the day waiting to buy a ticket. The process was really easy and they start to let people in 10 minutes before the scheduled time on your ticket. Probably only thing that annoyed me (and had nothing to do with the colosseum) is the Instagram culture of people trying to take that great photo for their profiles. Had to fight the crowds and dodge selfies to get decent shots of the colosseum and try to enjoy the history!,September 2019,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
What a fantastic hotel,From the moment we arrived at hotel Monte cenci we knew we were in for a treat. The doorman greeted us with the warmest smile and helped us get our bags to reception. Paolo the general manager was behind the desk and asked if we were willing to upgrade to a more expensive room and gave us a glass of Prosecco each and let us look at the room before making any decision. There was no pressure put on us at all and we were led to the rooftop bar to enjoy our drink and think about it. We decided to proceed with the upgrade as it provided us a private terrace and we were given a complimentary bottle of wine included with the upgrade. The room was beautiful and the terrace massive. Our bags were brought up to the room and by this point we were really impressed. The warmth given to us by all the staff was the best we received in our week stay in Italy. Paolo gave us a map and mapped out a walking route we could take before dinner that night (including which streets to take to enjoy better views of all the famous landmarks - Spanish steps/Trevi fountain). There were also some historic parts to Rome we never would have seen had Paolo not suggested this. Getting back to the room to freshen up before dinner I loved the shower and the light therapy they have set up in the shower. Very relaxing! Headed out to dinner at one of the recommendations Paolo gave us and we both really enjoyed the food (please see my other reviews for info on this). Unfortunately the second recommendation Paolo made for dinner the next night we were incredibly disappointed but will be feedback I’ll provide to Paolo and not something I hold against him or the hotel. The final icing on the cake for why I gave the hotel a 5 rating was our final night staying at the hotel. We had a day tour to the Amalfi Coast which went over by an hour and a half due to traffic (14.5 hour day) and when we got back to the hotel we were hoping room service would available. Unfortunately it wasn’t but Paolo personally offered to cook us some pasta off a limited menu. We went up to the rooftop bar and enjoyed a few wines and I saw Paolo in the kitchen cooking. What a personal touch! The pasta was also delicious and exactly what we wanted as we didn’t want to go out again due to an early start to the airport the next morning. Special mention also goes to princess who seemed to show interest in what we did each day although all the staff were incredibly happy and friendly and would do anything they could to make our stay the best it could be. Paolo even emailed me to see how our travels had ended and If there was any feedback we could provide (I have emailed back saying that he should speak to the owner of the 2nd restaurant or stop recommending it to non Italian tourists as it was a horrible experience for us). I would happily recommend this hotel and if our travels bring us back to Rome will choose hotel Monte cenci again.,September 2019,Monte Cenci Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d10553781-Reviews-Monte_Cenci_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,5.0,5.0
Disappointing. Agree with last couple of reviews,Such a disappointing meal at taverna trilussa. Completely agree with the last couple of reviews made. I can deal with poor service or an average meal but this was absolutely terrible. Recommended by our hotel (will be talking to the manager about this tomorrow) and feel like we were completely ripped off. Also had a few friends from back home say this was ok but obviously ate here a long time ago. Had the deep fried rice croquette to start and it was just ok followed by 2 pasta dishes. Both entree and main were out within 20 minutes max and beyond that couldn’t get waiters attention for anything. I wanted dessert so asked for the dolce menu (which the waiter brought over fairly quickly) and spent the next 10 minutes trying to get a waiter to assist. Made eye contact with a few waiters who then ignored our table completely. Actually had a waiter look at me and then use his phone next to our table but not serve us. Finally gave up and asked for the bill (the waiter seemed surprised). Another 10+ minutes and we still didn’t get the bill and then it was finally thrown on the table. We didn’t wait for them to take our card we paid at the desk as I was so angry by that point I just wanted out. If your hotel recommend this I only hope you read the last reviews. As a tourist I felt completely unwelcome and wouldn’t recommend this restaurant to anyone. I actually told people as I left (who were wanting to come in) not to bother. McDonald’s have better service and are cheaper. Wine was expensive and I’ve had nicer drops from coop. Soured my feelings towards my hotel too as I couldn’t believe they would recommend such a terrible restaurant.,September 2019,Taverna Trilussa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d814244-Reviews-Taverna_Trilussa-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Enjoyable meal in a nice restaurant,This restaurant was recommended to us by the hotel manager of where we are staying and I was a little skeptical however my partner and I both really enjoyed this restaurant. I had the lamb and my partner had the veal and then we both had dessert. Saw a previous review saying that the smallest amount of wine they could get was a half bottle but I think this is pretty normal for Italy or France and wasn’t an issue for us. Got bread to start and overall a very enjoyable start to Rome. We both loved our dessert. I’m not sure if I enjoyed the mousse more or my partners cherry tart (amazing). After posting photos on Facebook my mates back home said they’d been there before and also enjoyed the food. Would happily recommend to someone and will be thanking our hotel manager tomorrow for his suggestion.,September 2019,Costanza Hostaria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1103418-Reviews-Costanza_Hostaria-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Ok restaurant.,We came in for a dinner around 8pm at night and didn’t think it was anything special. The staff were friendly when they sat us down and I wouldn’t say it was a bad experience or meal just nothing to write home about. There was a 2 euro cover per person and we didn’t get anything for that (every other table seemed to get bread with their meals). Both of us had pasta that was nice but once again nothing to rave about. More an easy meal because we couldn’t be bothered looking anywhere else. Sure there would be nicer places to eat.,September 2019,Osteria Battipalla,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d5861329-Reviews-Osteria_Battipalla-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Beautiful spot but quite busy,Absolutely beautiful bridge to walk over and lined with jewellery shops on both sides. Friends told me to take my partner here to take the Mickey about getting engaged and I can see why. In the middle of the bridge there are points of both sides to take photos and the views are very pretty. If you’re going to Pitti palace go this way just for a look.

If you like religious art you’ll love it here,Went to Uffizi to basically see the birth of Venus and really enjoyed seeing it in person. There was another famous piece here that I didn’t realise was at Uffizi which was a treat but given it’s a lot of religious artwork I only gave it a 4 (this is more due to personal taste than anything). Beautiful building and it’s a compulsory start to your bundle ticket (highly recommend getting this as the Pitti palace was amazing and very little wait time with the bundle ticket). Well organised and the only negative was the large tour groups going through which make it feel more crowded than it needs to be). Can’t help but feel a bit of regulation of tourism in Italy would make it a better experience for everyone (I refuse to do walking groups now because of the masses they create).,September 2019,Gallerie Degli Uffizi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187895-d191153-Reviews-Gallerie_Degli_Uffizi-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
Really enjoyed this palace,What a wonderful place to visit. We came here as part of a bundle ticket we got for Uffizi (would definitely recommend doing this as good value and less wait time). The apartments and accom part of Pitti palace do not allow walking tours (atleast I couldn’t see any) so it made for a more enjoyable and less busy experience. The roofs. I could literally talk about them for hours. Beautiful! My neck is sore looking at all the artwork up there (included a few pictures). Saw the gardens as part of our ticket and didn’t really rate them that highly. I think the walk and effort vs payoff at the end didn’t equal but the Pitti palace was one of my highlights of Venice. Enjoyed it way more than Uffizi.,September 2019,Palazzo Pitti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187895-d209474-Reviews-Palazzo_Pitti-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Statue of David was impressive,Not really into religious art but had to see David while in Florence. The crowds were terrible (even at the end of the high season) and wouldn’t have gone had we not pre-booked a time slot to attend (wait was still pretty bad). Enjoyed the statues before the David statue but powered through the rest of the displays. If religious art is your thing you’ll probably get a lot of of it otherwise don’t waste too much time there and get in and out like we did. Group bookings and walking tours seem to pack into the place and makes it less enjoyable.,September 2019,Galleria dell'Accademia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187895-d195556-Reviews-Galleria_dell_Accademia-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",attractions,3.0,4.5
Fantastic first night in Florence,What a fantastic restaurant. Picked this restaurant due to the fact it was in the top 25 in Florence and it deserves the high rating. Having eaten pizza and pasta for the last week we felt like something different and ordered 2 steaks (one with mushroom and one with pepper gravy) and we weren’t disappointed. The meat was cooked perfectly and the gravy was amazing. Ordered the grilled vegetables and potatoes for sides and they were just as nice as the main. Didn’t get dessert because we were too full but they gave us a complimentary glass of limoncello each which was a lovely touch. All the staff were incredibly friendly and made us feel comfortable. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to any of my friends coming to Florence.,September 2019,Trattoria Verdi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d17630195-Reviews-Trattoria_Verdi-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Do the secret itinerary tour!,We pre-booked a secret itinerary tour and got to see the jails with a small group and an English speaking tour guide. This was one of my highlights of Venice! The tour guide was incredibly engaging and it was great to see it without the crowds you have at the rest of the palace. Learnt the story of Casanova which was really interesting. Definitely make a stop here if you’re in Venice!,September 2019,Doge's Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d194251-Reviews-Doge_s_Palace-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Blah hotel,Booked this hotel after seeing all the amazing reviews on trip advisor. Everyone spoke about how friendly the staff were but I can honestly say I felt like I was staying at a different hotel. It wasn’t until the afternoon before we left that a staff member at reception actually smiled at me. The staff were so cold to me that I put off asking for advice on booking a water taxi for when we departed until the day before we left and although the staff member assisted (and was friendly) he gave me incorrect information on how much the fare would be and my partner had to run to an ATM at the train station to take out extra money as the taxi wouldn’t accept card. The room/hotel is fairly dated and the shower head in the shower was terrible. Wifi quality was terrible too. Breakfast was ok and included in our room and probably one of the few highlights I had. Also enjoyed having a few drinks in the downstairs bar. You get a discount on 1 bill for staying at the hotel as well as a restaurant across the road. We didn’t go to the restaurant as trip advisor said it was a tourist trap with poor service. Not sure if it’s owned by the hotel or not but not sure why they would recommend a restaurant with such poor comments on trip advisor to their customers. Unfortunately would not recommend this hotel. Received multiple emails post leaving from the hotel asking for feedback and only hope the owners listen to what I said and have a word to their front of house staff (both front desk and breakfast). A smile doesn’t cost anything and would have made a massive difference to my experience. Also found the tip jar upstairs for cleaning staff very tacky (not sure how one exceeds their job and deserves a tip for something that is their job - maybe just the lack of tipping culture from the country I’m from).,September 2019,Hotel Ala-Palazzo Maurogonato,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187870-d241741-Reviews-Hotel_Ala_Palazzo_Maurogonato-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",hotels,2.0,4.5
Incredibly disappointing,We thought we would give La Rotonde a try even though TripAdvisor reviews were fairly poor (we thought this may be because the clientele who frequent hotel negresco weren’t tripadvisor users). Unfortunately we were wrong. We chose to sit inside the restaurant rather than eating outside (which was busier) and had the 1 waiter all night. We had decided to eat at La Rotonde because we both liked the sounds of the special available that day but we’re told it wasn’t available (possibly because it was a lunch special or because it sold out at lunch - the waiter wasn’t clear). Decided on other meals and a couple of glasses of wine with a side of beans. Our meals came out no problem but no side. Half way through eating I had to ask another staff member where they were and then our original waiter came over and said they were coming. They had obviously been forgotten but the waiter didn’t acknowledge this at all. We also had to prompt another waiter that we wanted more wine and when our original waiter came over he couldn’t remember what we had. I’d totally understand if the restaurant was busy but there was 1 other person he had to wait on inside so pretty poor service. Didn’t bother with dessert. Didn’t see the old la Rotonde (pre renovations) but found the roof fairly tacky. Staff seemed more interested in talking behind the bar than serving their customers. We had a fantastic stay at the hotel but the restaurant was incredibly disappointing and I would not recommend to anyone. The only Saving grace was the cooking of the meat however this didn’t outweigh the overall experience. Do yourself a favour and eat somewhere else.,September 2019,La Rotonde,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187234-d1322779-Reviews-La_Rotonde-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html,"Nice, France",restaurants,2.0,4.0
What an amazing hotel. Lavish,Had an amazing time staying at hotel negresco which started the moment our taxi pulled up and the doorman helped us out with our bags. I was a little apprehensive about arriving as some of the reviews about the hotel staff said they were rude but we didn’t experience this at all. We were lucky enough to have our room upgraded to a junior suite with Seaview and were told it would be ready for us in 30 minutes. Went for a walk along the water (beautiful) and everything was ready for us when we returned. The hotel itself is astounding in beauty. Just as much an art gallery as it is a hotel. The amount of people walking past taking photos all day made me feel lucky to be staying there. The only major negative we had was on the last night when we ate downstairs at la rotonde. I’ve written a seperate review of that as I don’t think it was a true reflection of the hotel itself (I definitely wouldn’t recommend eating there). Another slight negative was security who are there to stop people not staying at the hotel walking around. I sort of felt interrogated by their stares every time we walked in and it wouldn’t hurt for them to smile once in a while. The doorman as we left could have learnt to smile as well and I was quite happy not giving him a tip (which he put his hand out for) just for opening a taxi door for us. Would have been a 5 star review had the doorman not expected a tip for nothing and the restaurant not let us down. Special mention to the housekeeping staff. Every time we walked past their smiles were as big as the hotel and made us feel incredibly welcome.,September 2019,Hotel Negresco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187234-d195659-Reviews-Hotel_Negresco-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html,"Nice, France",hotels,4.0,4.0
Nice walk and worth it for the views!,Saw this on trip advisor before leaving home and really happy we did this walk. We started just before 5 and think it may have been a little busier than usual due to everyone doing the steps as part of their fitness routine however totally worth any crowds experienced. There was 2 buskers playing half way up who were great (so French) and the views were beautiful over nice. Saw people of all walks of life and fitness doing the hill so don’t be put off the steps.,September 2019,Castle Hill of Nice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187234-d247503-Reviews-Castle_Hill_of_Nice-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html,"Nice, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Ok casino but croupier doesn’t know what a smile is,Came here after dinner and was happy to see that the minimum bet on the roulette table was a lot lower than other casinos we’d been at in nice and Monte Carlo however that was quickly outweighed by the negativity we received from the croupier. Not sure if she was having a bad night but she seemed completely uninterested in her job. Didn’t make eye contact with anyone at the table and the only interaction she made was with the other staff around the tables. If I had a choice of here or another casino I’d rather take a higher minimum bet with better customer service. Would have given the place a 1 rating but we broke even on the slot machines before we left. Slot machine was the best customer service we got all night.,September 2019,Casino Du Palais De La Méditerranée,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187234-d11664604-Reviews-Casino_Du_Palais_De_La_Mediterranee-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alp.html,"Nice, France",attractions,2.0,3.5
Cute restaurant and friendly staff,Was a little skeptical what the food would be like given we were so close to the musee d’Orsay but can happily say this restaurant isn’t a tourist trap. My partner had the duck and I had pasta for dinner and both meals were really nice. The wines on offer were also quite nice and it was reasonably priced. The waiter who served us spoke great English (which is great as I speak terrible French) and was funny and very welcoming. Seemed to have quite a few French people eating in as well as tourists which is always a good sign. Will definitely eat here again when in Paris.,September 2019,Les Antiquaires,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d1035274-Reviews-Les_Antiquaires-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff,Stayed at Hotel d’Orsay for 2 nights and found the experience to be wonderful. Having come off a long haul flight we were exhausted when we arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in and the wonderful staff member on duty (wish I caught his name) was incredibly accommodating in finding a room for us to freshen up and rest in as we had a tour booked for the afternoon. The location is amazing. Other than the taxi to and from the hotel we walked everywhere (why wouldnt you in Paris!). We didn’t realise that our package also included breakfast and it was a great treat. The breakfast room was very cute and all the food in the buffet was of high standard. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Paris. Thanks hotel d’Orsay.

Great central hotel but very busy,Really enjoyed our stay at the Stamford however incredibly busy hotel. Very central and is connected to raffles centre and another hotel. Check in was a little chaotic with the self serve however plenty of staff around to assist. Asked for a late check due to a late flight we had and staff were very accommodating (at a charge). Only real complaint I had was around taxis. We waited over 25 minutes for a taxi to night safari and after almost getting into a fight with other patrons of the hotel who weren’t waiting at the appropriate waiting area the doorman told us to go to the hotel around the corner to get a cab as they don’t come to the Swissôtel as often. Saw other hotels flagging taxis down for their customers which would have been nice given the amount of staff on. Brasserie downstairs was nice. Had a really nice Chile white wine that I indulged in a few times.,September 2019,Swissôtel The Stamford Singapore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294265-d301573-Reviews-Swissotel_The_Stamford_Singapore-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",hotels,4.0,4.0
Amazing. Must see in singapore,"After visiting gardens by the bay last time we were in Singapore there was no way we were going to come back to singapore and not go again. Last time we visited the cloud forest wasn’t open so went with the intentions of just seeing that however we ended up buying a bundle which included the cloud forest, flower dome and a special event they had on called floral fantasy. The flower dome had a special orchard installation that wasn’t on last time which I really enjoyed. The cloud forest was interesting (I’m not a massive fan of heights) but the highlight was the floral fantasy. Day or night I would definitely recommend a visit to gardens by the bay!",September 2019,Gardens by the Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294265-d2149128-Reviews-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",attractions,5.0,4.5
Do the adventure safari tour,After getting a recommendation from my parents to do the night safari I looked online and saw that there was a semi private experience where you get a guided tour of the night safari. Wasn’t cheap but 100% do it. We were lucky and only shared the experience with another couple. We were treated like VIP and didn’t have to wait at all anywhere. A special buggy takes you everywhere the “train” takes you however at a much slower pace and you can stop right in front of the lions etc for photos. In fact I actually felt guilty for people not doing the experience as multiple trains went past and we were parked right in front of the action. The guide was fantastic. Very passionate about his job and the animals at the park. The absolute highlight was feeding the elephants at the end. Something I’ll never forget and I felt way more comfortable doing this than any animal tourist experience I’ve seen in other countries which I’ve avoided out of concern for the animals.

Seem to focus more on numbers in than the experience.,Arrived on time to wait in a room that didn’t have enough seating for the amount of people doing the experience. Communication was pretty poor and given we were doing an experience that included alcohol I didn’t expect children to be allowed (we had 2). We were herded into the capsule and it was incredibly crowded. Didn’t enjoy the experience at all and would not recommend to anyone. If you want a view better to do marina bay sands observation deck.,September 2019,Singapore Flyer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294265-d678639-Reviews-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",attractions,1.0,4.5
Beautiful building but pricy,Popped in for an afternoon drink before heading on a tour after finding the place on TripAdvisor. The building certainly didn’t disappointment. Beautiful Art Deco setting. Was prepared for the prices from other people’s reviews so expect to spend over $100 if you’re a couple and want a couple of drinks. Service was a little slow considering how many people were in there but the drinks were nice and they offered complimentary beetroot and sweet potato crisps while you wait.,September 2019,ATLAS Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d12358656-Reviews-ATLAS_Bar-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Amazing private dining experience,Having been to Locanda before for a private dining experience I was quite excited when my management suggested a private function for a work event and I can’t rave enough about the staff for their help in making it such a special day. From the very start Molly was so friendly and switched on and we had most of the details sorted within days. The manager on the day Brad was also incredibly accommodating with Molly in some minor changes we made to the package we had picked. The venue itself is beautiful. Every person that attended felt special being in a spacious dining space with our own host. Aya and Nancy made sure everyone’s needs were attended to and helped when we had speeches at the end. Food was delicious with everyone happy with the menu. A dessert for the person leaving our work after 30 years from the chef was a beautiful touch. Our party then moved out to the public bar area where Monty looked after our group. You wouldn’t have known the bar was busy with the laughs Monty and the other bar staff were providing us all night. Thanks once again Locanda team. Not the cheapest experience but well worth every penny.,July 2019,Locanda Restaurant & Public Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255100-d2418308-Reviews-Locanda_Restaurant_Public_Bar-Melbourne_Victoria.html,"Melbourne, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
