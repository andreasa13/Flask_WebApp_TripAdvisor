Best way possible to spend a sunny afternoon.,"We chose Gianni's over the other available boat hire options due to the friendly staff who advised on the best day to go & discussed the weather. We were loaned a large coolbox filled with ice & given a quick driving demo. Later in the day we had a problem with the engine & returned to the jetty. The problem was quickly fixed, & we were sent on our way. It is definitely the best way to see the island, & pulling up at a jetty by a restaurant for lunch is wonderful. Can definitely recommend.",September 2020,Giannis Boats,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g5028967-d10683503-Reviews-Giannis_Boats-Agios_Stefanos_Kassiopi_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Slightly different to the usual tourist traps and therefore wonderful!,"This restaurant offered a slightly different menu to the usual souvlaki & chips places so was very appealing. We weren't disappointed: the special was a plateful of delicious fresh prawns, simply cooked, & the fillet steak was excellent. The ""house wine"" on offer is always acceptable in these restaurants, & the service is friendly & efficient.",September 2020,Kochili Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189458-d2471393-Reviews-Kochili_Taverna-Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Wonderful place, right on the beach, well worth a visit.","We had to walk to reach the restaurant & it was well worth it, we went 3 times during the week. The owner told us about the specials & advised on some foods that we weren't too familiar with. Everything was delicious, the service was very friendly & the prices were good too (cash is preferred over cards).",September 2020,Taverna Kerasia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189458-d2064364-Reviews-Taverna_Kerasia-Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wonderful meal without the tackiness of the tourist restaurants.,"Our waiter asked if we wanted seafood or meat, then checked that we liked the food he had on offer before bringing out a range of absolutely delicious dishes. The wine was served in little metal jugs, we ate everything & there was not a dish of bright pink taramasalata or greasy chips in sight! Not cheap but you get what you pay for nowadays & it was a wonderful way to spend a relaxing, very long lunch with friends.",September 2020,Avli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662629-d2241886-Reviews-Avli-Corfu_Town_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fascinating!,"Wonderful museum, but beware of reaching cultural saturation point, there's so much to see! Very good cafe too.",September 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Authentic Greek food without the touristy tackiness.,"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel receptionist & satisfied our need for some good Greek food without pretentions & the usual tourist trappings. Tables were well-spaced & the waiter was knowledgeable about the food, without being pushy. A most enjoyable evening.",September 2020,Arcadia Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1501262-Reviews-Arcadia_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Worth the walk,"Get there early, as soon as it opens & wear very comfortable shoes. There's a lot of walking involved but the views are spectacular. Read all the info boards & be totally amazed at the fact that it's still there after all these years!",September 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wonderful hotel with surely the best view in the whole of Athens.,"We spent 3 nights at this hotel in September '20, arrived when it was dark & opened our curtains to see the most amazing view of the Acropolis, all beautifully lit up for the night. We had a snack in the restaurant up on the roof & couldn't take our eyes off the stunning panorama. The room (no. 320) had the view to die for, waking up to see the Acropolis while lying in bed was a thrill. It's well worth paying the extra money & having a small balcony to sit out on as well. We ate in the restaurant on our last evening & had a wonderful meal. Not cheap but as far removed from souvlaki & chips as it was possible to be! The hotel was very quiet, there were strict rules in place re facemasks & social distancing. Our room was only cleaned once during the stay which we felt was a good way for the hotel to save money, & with a reduced number of guests the staff should have been able to conduct daily room cleaning & tidying. However it did not spoil the trip & we hope to go back as soon as we can.",September 2020,Herodion Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228864-Reviews-Herodion_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Little evidence of any cleaning.,"The food service area was very Covid-aware & efficient. The food was good enough, somewhat heavy & stodgy - lasagne, meat pies etc: The salad bar was thin & uninspiring (6pm on a Sunday in August), but what we had was quite tasty. Staff were very friendly & helpful, but absolutely no-one was in the restaurant area clearing & cleaning tables. Most restaurants require tables (&chairs) to be cleaned & sanitised between each use, but there was absolutely no sign of this at Tebay, leaving us feeling quite uneasy. The services at Cairn Lodge were the exact opposite, the restaurant tables were being constantly cleaned & sprayed.",August 2020,Tebay Services,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2531938-d733688-Reviews-Tebay_Services-Tebay_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Tebay, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Oh dear.,"We were all having a very pleasant lunch, the food was ok but the Cullen Skink (soup) was very weak and a bit tasteless. When we ordered puddings, 3 sticky toffee puds, one without ice cream, 2 of them arrived quickly. We waited patiently, the 3rd didn't seem to be on its way so we asked. About 10 minutes later it finally arrived, along with the jug of custard. By now the first 2 puds had been eaten so we said we didn't require the custard, it was too late. Shortly after, the manager, or perhaps he was just a male waiter, appeared & asked what the problem was as one of his staff was ""in floods of tears"". We apologised, that hadn't been our intention to upset anyone, but when we tried to explain that we were hoping to all eat our puds at the same time he let rip. Now I know things are hard at the moment & they were a bit busy, but he was exceptionally rude, wouldn't allow us to get a word in & frankly shouldn't be working in a service industry. So do be careful if you order more than 1 thing, you might all be eating separately, & don't expect any form of explanation or apology. (The sticky toffee pudding was good, & helped to make up for the disappointing soup.)",August 2020,Glen Clova Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1478139-d528104-Reviews-Glen_Clova_Hotel-Clova_Angus_Scotland.html,"Clova, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.5
"Mega brunch, well worth the wait!","I approached the restaurant to be greeted by a long queue. The young lady informed me that they would have a table in 40 minutes so I chose to wait outside with a coffee until the rest of my family arrived. At precisely the right time we were shown to a table inside, it's rather cramped but cosy & the staff were very helpful in storing baby buggies, large suitcases & finding a highchair. The food was superb, it came amazingly quickly considering the number of people there & the size of the kitchen. Although not cheap, it was all of excellent quality & well worth the money. We shall be back!",March 2020,Greenwoods Singel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188590-d1309073-Reviews-Greenwoods_Singel-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Wonderful friendly, central hotel.","I wanted a hotel located towards the south of the city and one where I would feel comfortable being on my own for 3 nights. The Prinsengracht hotel fitted the bill, it was easy to reach the centre of the city as well as the area where my family was staying. Staff were most helpful, they booked taxis, loaned umbrellas & assisted with online flight check-in. Only downside was that my room (408), one of the larger superior rooms with a fantastic view, was next to the lift and so could be quite noisy at times. However it won't put me off booking there again, I'll just ask for a room at the other end of the hotel.",March 2020,Prinsengracht Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188590-d237564-Reviews-Prinsengracht_Hotel-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",hotels,4.0,3.5
