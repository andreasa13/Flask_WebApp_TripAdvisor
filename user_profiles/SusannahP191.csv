Delicious fresh food,"Booked an outdoor table for lunch, initially in the 'marque', but we chose to sit outside on one of the picnic tables.

Excellent prompt service from a delightful friendly waitress.

Lovely roof terrace,"Stayed here for several nights and the place grew on me.

My first impressions were not positive as the area where the hotel is located is not great - an unattractive busy main road. However the location was only about a 10 - 15 minute walk to the main sites , restaurants etc. The room rate was extremely reasonable.

Our ""deluxe"" room was hardly deluxe - plain nondescript room, nothing in the room or on the walls to make it look attractive or deluxe. Tiny balcony with a missing wooden slat (health and safety?!) which wasn't big enough to sit out on.

Nice bathroom with a separate bath with shower and a shower cubicle which also contained the loo!! Not great when the floor is wet after a shower!

Toiletries provided, but no cups or water glasses. A refrigerator in the room, but this was the only hotel in Greece that did not provide any complimentary bottled water.

On a more positive note, the staff were very friendly and helpful.

The buffet breakfast in the very well appointed basement dining room was excellent and Covid measures were in place. The waitress were excellent.

The rooftop terrace bar and restaurant had a fabulous view of the city and the Acropolis. However the house wine at 8 Euros a glass was absolutely outrageous.

Can't stand using tiny bits I of tissue (looked like folded up loo paper!) which were provided for breakfast and which we had to make do with for dinner - as useful as a chocolate teapot.

Highly recommended.",November 2019,Pavillon Indochine Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297390-d469306-Reviews-Pavillon_Indochine_Hotel-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Very pleasant,"It looked nice and it was. Nice comfy seating, not too noisy and decent prices.

We shared a starter - stuffed soft tortillas which were delicious.

My husband had the cheese burger, again very good, although the first attempt had to be returned as it was cold. A replacement came very quickly.

I had the spicey seafood soup with lemongrass and coconut with rice. More like a stew, and was excellent.

Good choice of wines. Ptices ok.",November 2019,Cafe Latino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d7082494-Reviews-Cafe_Latino-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Fabulous small hotel,"Excellent central location.

Large tasteful and airy rooms. Friendly and very helpful staff.

The swimming pool was most welcome after a day's sight seeing in the heat and humidity.

The breakfast was really excellent, one of the best cooked to order breakfasts I have had on this month long trip. Always swiftly served.

We ate supper here on our first evening when we were to tired to look for restaurants elsewhere. I only realised they even served meals, other than breakfast, when I saw another resident order an evening meal. It wasn't made clear that the hotel offered this option, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.

Lovely area under the ceiling fans to chill out in the evening with a beer and a good book.

Highly recommended.",November 2019,Villa Borann,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293940-d3910195-Reviews-Villa_Borann-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",hotels,5.0,4.0
Desperate but a must,"A grim but thought provoking visit.

30 minutes from the centre of Phnom Penh. Allow 2 hours for the audio visit.",November 2019,Choeung Ek Genocidal Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293940-d469300-Reviews-Choeung_Ek_Genocidal_Center-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Grim but a must,"The terrible deeds that took place less that forty years ago are illustrated here most graphically.

Essential to visit here to get a full understanding what this country has gone through.

We also owe the victims of this genocide the means to pass on this history to the world.",November 2019,Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293940-d324063-Reviews-Tuol_Sleng_Genocide_Museum-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Underwelming,You don't need to allow too much time here. Probably far more impressive at night when lit up. Spent about 15 minutes here.,November 2019,Wat Phnom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293940-d469303-Reviews-Wat_Phnom-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",attractions,2.0,4.0
Open during Water Festival,"So pleased the Royal Palace was open during our stay which coincided with the Water Festival.

We took a chance and wandered over there at 0900 hrs (we were told it was closed by our hotel) and were delighted that it was open until noon.

We spent an hour and three quarters wandering around the compound, which wasn't very busy.

A few of the buildings were closed for renovation and the more impressive buildings now photography was allowed inside.

The most spectacular aspect of the complex was the mural depicting the classic Indian epic of the Ramayana (known as the Reamker in Cambodia). The story begins just south of the east gate and includes vivid images of the battle of Lanka. The mural was created around 1900 and parts of it have recently undergone restoration.",November 2019,Royal Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293940-d324064-Reviews-Royal_Palace-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,4.0

Have a cocktail in style,"We had to stop by for a cocktail and a snack whilst in Phnom Penh.

The epitomy of colonial style and grandeur, even if the rather intrusive 'background' music was a bit out of place.

Had to have a Singapore Sling - essence. Also had smoked salmon on blinis which were delicious.

If you want a splurge and have drink in a beautiful old style bar, I can't recommend The Elephant Bar in Raffles Hotel enough.",November 2019,Elephant Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293940-d4355978-Reviews-Elephant_Bar-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,4.5
