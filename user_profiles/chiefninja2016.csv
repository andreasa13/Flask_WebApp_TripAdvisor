"New City, New Hard Rock Cafe to visit","We visit the Hard Rock Cafe in as many of the places we visit as possible and Athens did not disappoint, for those who have been before it’s just as lovely as the others, those that haven’t yet tried Hard Rock please do, food and atmosphere brilliant.

A welcome break from the heat,"We visited the museum after the Acropolis which meant we were very grateful for the air conditioning, as we walked round it wasn’t made clear by any signs as to where you could or couldn’t take photos, there are plenty of staff who will tell you to stop when it’s not permitted.

We left the restaurant after sitting for 10 minutes with no staff coming over to our table and us not able to attract their attention or any clear guidance as to where to get a menu so we sort refreshment elsewhere.

The artefacts made the visit worthwhile and the excavation area under the museum was one of my favourite parts.",September 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
A must see,"The Acropolis is a must see, go early in the day or late before closing when it’s not too hot, wear good shoes as the paths are uneven (stone / gravel).
The view of Athens from the top is lovely, you can see for miles.
We take a stuffed toy ( Yoda ) on our travels but were asked not to take pictures with the toy at the site, there are guards posted in many places so best not to try taking sneaky ones.",September 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Breath taking views,"Myself and my Husband have just stayed here for a city break, firstly the views from some rooms and the roof top restaurant are breathtaking, The Acropolis one side and Zeus’s Temple the other, it’s perfectly located for exploring the city on foot, there is a met stop or hop on hop off stop nearby if you can’t walk too far.

Breakfast was lovely with a good choice, the staff have been excellent, whether at breakfast, bar service, reception staff all brilliant.

Due to Covid and the hotel not being at full capacity they were able to allow us to check out just an hour before our transfer, so we could shower after walking in the heat before flying home, which was greatly appreciated.

There is traffic noise, but being right in the centre that is to be expected, and traffic is very busy in Athens, it didn’t affect our sleep or take anything away from how fabulous our stay has been.

I would recommend Athens Gate and definitely stay again.",September 2020,The Athens Gate Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d227384-Reviews-The_Athens_Gate_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5

The only disappointment is the gluten free options were very limited and the same most nights but I have managed to eat very well most of the time, more cooked or grilled vegetables would be the only thing that would of given me more choices as lots of the foods are in sauces.
