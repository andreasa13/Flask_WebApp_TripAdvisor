Fascinating museum,"This is not an objective nor a non-partisan museum - as its title gives away. It tells the story of a particular community dealing with traumatic events in a community-led way and offers only its own perspective and interpretation of history.

I was wary about it being pro-IRA and was relieved that this wasn’t the case although the links are mentioned when relevant.

The guides are knowledgable locals with direct links to events and are happy to answer questions. It really clarified the events around Bloody Sunday and how it influenced the Troubles and recent Northern Irish history.",August 2019,Museum of Free Derry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186482-d625287-Reviews-Museum_of_Free_Derry-Derry_County_Londonderry_Northern_Ireland.html,"Derry, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing Hamburger,"Just an amazing deluxe burger with cheese, bacon and pickle. Juicy and tasty. Lovely view over the bay at the outside tables .",July 2019,The Keel Row,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551865-d1770092-Reviews-The_Keel_Row-Fionnphort_Isle_of_Mull_The_Hebrides_Scotland.html,"Isle of Mull, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great location,"Pretty basic campsite. Clean toilets (2) and shower (1). Dish cleaning area is in each bathroom.
Field drains well but found it hard to get pegs in deep before hitting stone. No shelter from wind.
Best feature: Site is practically in the village and there are 4 pubs, a Chinese takeaway, a cooperative and cafe/bakers 5 mins walk.",May 2019,Demesne Farm Campsite & Bunkhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1916987-d4290745-Reviews-Demesne_Farm_Campsite_Bunkhouse-Bellingham_Northumberland_England.html,"Bellingham, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.5
Well worth it.,"Lives up to the hype and really easy to imagine what it would’ve been like in its heyday. The information plaques were not very informative, just descriptive. Better to go to the museum first.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great little museum,Really clever museum that has lots of hands-on replica inventions and explains ideas using video as well as text. Helpful staff.,April 2019,Kotsanas Museum of Ancient Greek Technology,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d13492914-Reviews-Kotsanas_Museum_of_Ancient_Greek_Technology-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,5.0
Bit dry,"Nice range of artefacts but poorly laid out with no guidance on how each item relates to its neighbours or even how to navigate each floor. The interpretation text that accompanies the artefacts is very academic, difficult to read and lacks context.",April 2019,Museum of Cycladic Art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198712-Reviews-Museum_of_Cycladic_Art-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Okay,Was really looking forward to this museum but it’s just okay. Very little explanation is provided in the accompanying text and it assumes you have a background in classical studies (I do and I was still struggling). It’s definitely better to go to this museum first before going to the Acropolis rather,April 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Midweek visit,Nice spa and atmosphere. Went on a midweek midday session so it was chilled but wouldn’t want to go during high season - it doesn’t have much capacity.,April 2019,Hammam Baths,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2054930-Reviews-Hammam_Baths-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Bell Tent,"This is my first time staying in the bell tents though I’ve stayed in the main house accommodation before and have camped in my own tent. But the bell tents were a complete change and I absolutely loved it! Definitely a bit more magical than the usual camping.

They sleep 5 - 3 single beds and 1 double and they’re all proper mattresses but on ground level wooden pallets and have 13 tog duvets which were great but I took my own blankets in case it got colder. There are 2 all-weather bean bags, a wooden trunk for storage and a lamp. There are no plugs so bring your batteries full charged.

There are picnic benches attached to each tent and they’re all spaced out so you’ve got plenty of privacy.

The tents are made of really heavy green canvas so deal with rain no problem, and the zips on the vents and doors are robust.

The fry-up breakfast was great as well.

Would definitely do this again. Perfect for chilled out get-togethers",May 2018,YHA Hawkshead,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186325-d1067054-Reviews-YHA_Hawkshead-Hawkshead_Ambleside_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Hawkshead, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
Lovely little gem,"Amazing views over the bay and up to Ravenscar. Clean and fresh toilets though the showers are small. Kitchen/wash area has 2 freezers , fridge, kettles. The pitching ground is reasonable soft and slightly slopes.",April 2018,Hooks House Farm Campsite,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g504012-d654560-Reviews-Hooks_House_Farm_Campsite-Robin_Hoods_Bay_North_York_Moors_National_Park_North_Yorkshir.html,"Robin Hoods Bay, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Good location,"Staff were friendly and rooms were clean. Building works were going on which meant that the communal space was really a staff lounge for the builders which was not very welcoming for guests. Kitchen is small with hob, toaster and microwave (no oven). Location is great and the surrounding area had great bars and restaurants. There aren't that many security lockers and they're not located in bedroom but in hallway (in line of sight of reception desk).",February 2017,Hatters Hilton Chambers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187069-d621176-Reviews-Hatters_Hilton_Chambers-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,3.0
Great all inclusive holiday.,"Really impressed by the quality of the accommodation, staff, food and services available. The buffet had an extensive choice of food including a ""wall of bread"" that you could chose from and a juice bar in the morning. There was always a choice of meats, including fish as well Greek specialties and a counter catering to less adventurous tastes featuring fries, pizza, hamburgers etc.

The all-inclusive drinks option featured vodka, gin, brandy, flavoured liqueurs, whiskey, rum and all soft drinks including slush-puppies and they were decent spirits if not well-known brands.

All the staff were friendly and well trained and seemed to like their jobs.

Don't bother bringing a beach towel as they are available free at reception as well as the wifi password (which you'll need to hang on to throughout your week as you will need to re-enter it from time to time).

It's not clear on the website but the gym is the only thing freely available in the spa to hotel customers but not the indoor heated pool. The staff in the spa were friendly too. Prices are about the same as you would pay back home with a Gel French Pedicure coming in at €37.

The animation team provided activities for adults as well as kids including stretching exercises, Zumba, French Bowls, Quizzes, local walks etc.

We spend half our time exploring the island and half relaxing by the pool. The hotel has a selection of books in different languages if you have ran out of summer reading.

Sissi town is quite small and as we were there at the start of the season, it wasn't completely open. There was a local Irish bar with regular live music. If you like hiking/running there are some paths along the coast.
Car hire was a good option.
Creteaquarium was a great way to escape a rainy day (only €6) and I recommend getting the Audioset as it had some good, in-depth explanations on the sea-life.

A trip to Milatos cave is worthwhile for local history. A trip to Knossos Palace is great for history buffs. They offer a 2-in-1 ticket to the Archaeological museum but fail to mention that it is 30 mins drive away from Knossos and that is closes at 3pm. Bit of a con especially since all the great artifacts from Knossos are stored in the museum.",March 2016,Vasia Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608862-d529425-Reviews-Vasia_Resort_Spa-Sissi_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
View to the ancient-ancient greeks.,"Great ancient ruin with lots of information available on the plaques at each building. The original 1920 archaeologist Evans very much put his impression of what the palace would have looked like 4000 years ago through reconstruction of buildings using his ideas of their functions. Even though some of the functions have been revealed to be wrong it's still interesting to see the structures and some replicated wall murals.

If you're a history buff, this is a treat to see a Minoan civilisation where linear B script was just being introduced.",March 2016,The Palace of Knossos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g13124727-d195896-Reviews-The_Palace_of_Knossos-Knosos_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Just off the Mall,Great food in a casual atmosphere - it's a bit of a squeeze so get there early. There's no foyer to wait for a seat so you may be asked to wait outside.,February 2016,Shoryu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d3677102-Reviews-Shoryu-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
