Enjoyable lunch,"Met some friends in this pub in the centre of Ely, what a joy...
Menu varied, food hot and tasty and good price. Staff were attentive and helpful.
I had the scallops to start which were cooked perfectly, the presentation was definitely a high point and gastropub describes this pub well.

Food fresh and therefore a little slow, but not a concern.

Birthday meal for my Brother,"Arrived early and was seated by the friendly staff, as we were quite early they brought as a couple of tasters - a nice touch (and very tasty)
Food was fresh, hot and plentiful, I think I have a big appetite but they filled me up.

Sunday Lunch,"Had Sunday Lunch at the Gray Ox. My Father in Law used to drink here as a boy and the last time he visited was 1944 - it had changed a bit.
The three course set Sunday Lunch menu had a variety of choices that would suit all, the normal menu was also packed with good comfort food staples. My Father in law saw the Fish and Chips and was very pleased with his choice.
My wife and I had the Roast Beef
that was cooked pink and was very succulent, the Yorkshire puddings did Yorkshire proud :-)
The service from the kitchen was fast and the food tasty, of particular note was the staff who were friendly and helpful, the pub was busy (we sat down at 2pm) but was quietening down around this time - so a good time to visit.
We really enjoyed the food and the service - a good choice for Sunday Lunch.

The art of good service,"Really enjoyed our stay, on an autumn saver. this included afternoon tea, 5 course taster menu, room and breakfast.
Room was beautiful, bed massive and extremely comfortable. Fridge stocked with complementary goodies and bath and shower super.
As a Michelin starred restaurant the food was varied and exquisite, with little tasters in between courses that added to the taste and experience.
The servers were spot on and were fully clued up on the food, its origin and the way it was cooked, our Sommelier knew his stuff and we enjoyed chatting about the wines.
A gift of creams were on the bed after our taster menu that finished the day off.
Breakfast was a joy and we were sad to leave.

Surprised visitor,"Really impressed with the day. I was a reluctant visitor as have watched, and enjoyed all the films. I didnt expect to be surprised by the exhibits, especially the level of detail required to produce a film of this type.

As a top tip I would suggest taking your own food as it was a bit basic and pricey
