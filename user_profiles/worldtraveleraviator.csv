Great Stay! Fantastic!,"Intercontinental Athenaeum is one of the best hotels I have stayed in Europe! The rooms are very spacious and provide great value for their price. A family suite provides a fair cost for more than 500 square feet of spacious accommodation for 5 people. Clean rooms block out noise and provide high sleep quality, which is of the utmost importance for one's stay! Breakfast is absolutely amazing and includes a wide spread of different breads, pastries, vegetables, fruits, yogurt, cold cuts, etc.. I found the fresh waffles made on request to be quite delicious. The staff at this hotel are very friendly and accommodating towards requests, and quick to help; the hotel manager and front-desk are additionally very warm and welcoming. The service is fantastic!! I could not find any fault with it. There was no problem with the location. Although several others had commented on the proximity of a worn-down neighborhood to the hotel, my family felt very safe during the entirety of our recent 1-week stay at this hotel! The front lobby is exceedingly spacious and provides great space to relax. If you're hungry, both the Art Bistrot and Premiere restaurant (which provides amazing dinner and views of the Acropolis, although somewhat pricey) are feasible options for your meals. This hotel deserves its 5-star rating! Must-stay in Athens!",December 2019,InterContinental Athenaeum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d233052-Reviews-InterContinental_Athenaeum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0

The best small carrier I have ever flown in!,"Aegean/Olympic Air operated my flight between Athens and Santorini and the return. The outbound to Santorini consisted of a very quick and efficient boarding procedure conducted by Aegean Airlines. The crew passed out aroma-therapeutic orange candies before takeoff. I cannot comment on the full service, as due to turbulence, the full service was not carried out; however, the crew passed out little ginger cookies as we left the aircraft.
The sole purpose of this review is to underscore the efficiency and care taken by Aegean to compensate my family and me for the cancellation of our return flight to Athens from Santorini due to extremely bad weather. The cancellation of the flight and provisions afterward prove that Aegean is concerned about the safety of their passengers and willing to take care of their passengers' needs. After Aegean canceled our Olympic Air flight, they instructed us to proceed to one of the two Aegean ticketing counters. Upon arrival, an agent swiftly printed out a new boarding pass to replace our previous one, placing our return flight the next day, and asked us if we had any concerns. Having decided on a day trip to Santorini, we did not have a place to stay. Aegean booked us into a FIVE-STAR hotel for the night and included breakfast and dinner as well. They even covered transportation both ways between the hotel and the airport! Aegean took the time to make sure their customers were safe and provided a place to stay for not only me and my family but also all other passengers on my cancelled flight. I haven't seen any other airlines do this, especially for weather-related cancellations. The return flight, although extremely turbulent, departed on time, and it was skillfully handled by the crew and experienced pilots who successfully navigated the turboprop through extremely heavy cloud cover and moderate winds. Way to go, Aegean! Keep up the great work!",December 2019,AEGEAN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8728985-Reviews-AEGEAN,World,flights,5.0,4.0

Excellent food,"Been to this restaurant 2 times. Ordered their starter, the spring rolls. Filling was delicious and so was the sauce that accompanied it. Waiter was super friendly and assisted us with our order. Hot towels before service. Amazing! For the main, we had the pad thai noodles, which were delicious, the chengdu chicken and the pepper steak. Restuarant is one of the biggest restaurants I've ever seen, with 3 floors.

The food was delicious!,"The food was absolutely delicious. A must-visit for hungry travelers in Fresno.
Recommendations:
-The lunch platter is well-priced and the restaurants is generally full, so try to reserve a table. The spicy lamb and the orange chicken are must-trys.
-For the appetizer plate, you get fried chicken and a spring roll, accompanied by a peanut-sauce salad which is delicious.
-You can choose Egg-Drop or Hot and Sour for the soup.

"Excellent Buffet, food was delicious","Went there for Christmas Day dinner buffet. Food was delicious. There was a large variety of curries, noodles, rice, paneer, fried appetizers, and breads. My favorite part of the buffet was the dessert. There were so many desserts to choose from, among them being plum pudding, mango soft-serve ice cream(ABSOLUTELY delish), warm bread pudding, and delicious cake, gulab jamun, and rasmalai.

"Food was ok, value was extremely disappointing.","Cascal was one of many options that we had for our celebration. Cascal won, so we went there for dinner. The place was extremely crowded, but thanks to the nice atmosphere, large entry area, and efficient staff, we were seated almost immediately. For the appetizer, we ordered the pomegranate meatballs and the wild mushroom empanadas. Those were delicious. Next, we ordered the paella, which was extremely disappointing, as it lacked moisture and had very little meat. We also ordered more delicious warm bread and some other snacks. For dessert, my wife ordered a warm chocolate souffle and I ordered the flan. The souffle was sticky and warm, but the flan was opposite in quality. It was extremely dry and oversweet. I would recommend everybody to definitely try out this restaurant but you would have to order the right dishes.",December 2017,Cascal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32761-d379012-Reviews-Cascal-Mountain_View_California.html,"Mountain View, California",restaurants,3.0,4.0
