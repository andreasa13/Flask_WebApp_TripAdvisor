Bigger room than thought I would receive,"I truly have no complaints.
Room is quite spacious for solo visitor. Room can accommodate 2, if truth be known.

Staff VERY accommodating esp for my additional towel requests and when I have a brain freeze and can't figure out how to turn on TV or turn off lights.

I'm on vacation, I'm automatically in Stupid mode and I thank them for not holding that against me.

Overall, no complaints. On the 1st floor and although others have complained abt the noise, I'm a New Yorker and noise is my lullaby so does not bother me at all.

My ONLY concern/peeve --> shower is WAY too small. It's closed in and if I weighed more, no way i would EVER fit. I turn around and accidentally turn off the water.

They could've made it a tad bigger. Feel almost like I'm in a standup coffin --> it's THAT confining.
