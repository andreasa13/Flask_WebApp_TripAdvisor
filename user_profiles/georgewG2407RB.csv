Burgers and more burgers,"A nice place to go to get a decent burger. Food was very good, fries were better than normal. Service could improve a little because it is very busy.

DCI Competition,We agree with everything that is written about Mario's Pizza. Small place with big good food. A small pizza is enough for three. The calzone is even bigger and better. Will go back when in the area.,July 2019,Mario's Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49680-d818934-Reviews-Mario_s_Pizza-Winston_Salem_North_Carolina.html,"Winston Salem, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Better late than never,Stop by near closing time and glad we did. We ordered from the specials menu and had very good food. U had a number 25 and my wife had a number 16. Both were very good. The chips and salsa was also very good. Service was very good and friendly.,May 2019,Los Potros Mexican Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54946-d2217039-Reviews-Los_Potros_Mexican_Restaurant-Chattanooga_Tennessee.html,"Chattanooga, Tennessee",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Wife approved,"I highly recommend the comfort suites at Forsyth. Convenient, friendly staff, accommodating and quiet. Towels were big and soft.

Fish on Friday,"Heard the Friday night fish fry was good and worth the wait. I agree wholeheartedly. I was surprised by the size of the tavern, crowded, cozy and warm. Parking can be a problem but all apart of the experience of eating at a neighborhood tavern.",April 2019,Oakcrest Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60859-d1100830-Reviews-Oakcrest_Tavern-Madison_Wisconsin.html,"Madison, Wisconsin",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Just passing through,WE were looking for a quiet place to stay and the motel met that goal. Beds were comfortable. Towels were a little thin but adequate. The breakfast was hot and cold but nothing to write home about. Would stay there again. It's not close to other restaurants.,April 2019,"Red Roof Inn & Suites Danville, IL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35875-d90700-Reviews-Red_Roof_Inn_Suites_Danville_IL-Danville_Illinois.html,"Danville, Illinois",hotels,4.0,4.5
Off the beaten path,If you want a place to go to feel like you are along the Appalachian Trail try trails at sunderbruch park. Slippery when wet and lots of ups and downs. Enjoy the outdoors.,March 2019,Sunderbruch Park Trail,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g37816-d10084762-Reviews-Sunderbruch_Park_Trail-Davenport_Iowa.html,"Davenport, Iowa",attractions,5.0,5.0
Just like home,"Always looking for that pizza that tastes as good as the pizza we grew up with. Tony's is as close to that pizza, from the Pizza villa in LaCrosse. We like a thin crust pizza with Italian sausage and green olives. That is what we ordered at Tony's and enjoyed every piece. They also serve a deep dish pizza so we ordered a slice for comparison and it was very good as well.",March 2019,Tony's Chicago Style Pizzeria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g37816-d12441550-Reviews-Tony_s_Chicago_Style_Pizzeria-Davenport_Iowa.html,"Davenport, Iowa",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Quiet and Comfortable,Needed a place to stay near Northern Kentucky University and this one fit the bill. Asked for a quiet room on the ground floor and got one in the back building. Only suggestion would be that the second story would have possibly been quieter as we could hear people above us.,March 2019,Best Western Clermont,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60993-d224900-Reviews-Best_Western_Clermont-Cincinnati_Ohio.html,"Cincinnati, Ohio",hotels,4.0,4.0
Kentucky Proud,"Was looking for a place to get a quick meal after the WGI event at Northern Kentucky University, decided to try Mac's. It was a Saturday evening and March Madness was in full bloom. Needless to say Mac's had every TV tuned to basketball and there are a lot of TVs in the place. So if you wanted to have a nice quiet supper this wasn't the place. It was hoppin. The food was very good to include the pizza and salads.",March 2019,Mac's Pizza Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g39288-d15636081-Reviews-Mac_s_Pizza_Pub-Cold_Spring_Kentucky.html,"Cold Spring, Kentucky",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Spring Break,"If you want a quiet meal at a local long term establishment try the Flagler Tavern on Flagler Ave, NSB. The main floor has live entertainment, the outside deck has entertainment plus the noise of the street but the upstairs is a quiet retreat from the hussel and bussel at the lower floors. My wife and I enjoy the food and quiet atmosphere of the upstairs. My wife always orders the Rock Shrimp and enjoys the effort to get to the real meal. I had the Fresh Haddock Sandwich where the haddock is done to perfection and ""huge"". We topped it off with a glass of Sangria and a nice dark beer. If Ross is on duty he will surely make you dining experience a pleasure.",March 2019,Flagler Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34471-d7106809-Reviews-Flagler_Tavern-New_Smyrna_Beach_Florida.html,"New Smyrna Beach, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Lots of food,Love to go to Manny's when we are in NSB. The food is served in generous portions and is good. My wife and I get a small greek salad and veggie calzone and take a small piece home. The girls ordered the regular portions of spaghetti and zetti and had enough for tomorrows lunch. The greek salads are wonderful. Every night has a special and well worth looking at if you like italian food. Friendly atmosphere great family food.,March 2019,Manny's Pizza Beachside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34471-d516552-Reviews-Manny_s_Pizza_Beachside-New_Smyrna_Beach_Florida.html,"New Smyrna Beach, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Ancient world,"On a recent Viking Ocean cruise my wife and I had the pleasure of visiting the Acropolis. A great experience to be sure, and well worth the hike up. Site can be crowded so take your time. Also the walk up is steep so take your time and enjoy the views. Try and remember that this ancient wonder has been enjoyed by hundred of thousand over the centuries. It must have been a wonder back when it was build. If raining or wet the walk up can be slippery. We were there in the ""off season"" and it was crowded so I imagine it would be very crowded during the tourist season. I would guess that you can budget 1-2 hours to see and enjoy the experience.",March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Sunny Day in Charleston,Looking for a nice place for a fun luncheon try the Rarebit. Typical sports bar with a little less sports and decent food. Service was quick and the server was friendly. We had four different meals and no complaints. The Impossible Burger was interesting and worth trying.,March 2019,The Rarebit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d3807516-Reviews-The_Rarebit-Charleston_South_Carolina.html,"Charleston, South Carolina",restaurants,4.0,4.5
St Paddy's Day Surprise,"If you want to see Irish and have a little fun go to McKenna's Place.
We actually went there the day before St Paddy's and the place was jumping. Green everywhere. With a special menu featuring Irish dishes you had plenty to pick from. I recommend the corn beef sandwich and my wife had the corn beef dinner. Both were very good. The crowd was generous and we sat at outside tables that were setup to handle the overflow. The small Irish band was an added extra.",March 2019,McKenna's Place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34471-d1526703-Reviews-McKenna_s_Place-New_Smyrna_Beach_Florida.html,"New Smyrna Beach, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Long time enjoyment,We have been visiting Mikey's for over 20 years and still enjoy their pizza. Every time we visit New Smyrna Beach the first place we have to go to is Mikey's. Check on their specials because you can get two large pizza's for a little more than the price of one. Leftovers are always enjoyed by the family and make the pleasure of buy there even more enjoyable.,March 2019,Mikey's Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34471-d438300-Reviews-Mikey_s_Pizza-New_Smyrna_Beach_Florida.html,"New Smyrna Beach, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Wednesday night in Charleston,"What a wonderful experience. Sat down to a three course meal and enjoyed every moment. A lot of the evenings enjoyment was due to our server, Denis. He had an excellent knowledge of not only the food but the right wine that goes with each item. His little stories made the night even more enjoyable. Go early, ask to be served by Denis, and enjoy the evening. By the way the food was excellent.",March 2019,Circa 1886 Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436564-Reviews-Circa_1886_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html,"Charleston, South Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
