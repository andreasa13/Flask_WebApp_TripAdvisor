Wonderful retreat,Located on a quiet alley very close to the center and within walking distance to all the local attractions and all the restaurants. Spotless clean and bright large room with a whirlpool bath. We were pampered with a full mini fridge woth soft drinks. There's a lovely rooftop terrace to sip a coffee with lovely views of the churches and mountains. Definitely recommend it,November 2020,Flora Valley Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293983-d21509107-Reviews-Flora_Valley_Boutique_Hotel-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",hotels,5.0,5.0
Noisy good food but not so good service,"The ace is big and noisy
Margaritas wede great. Food was also very good. Service however was very slow and inattentive. We also had to ask for new cutlery as it was not really clean.

Very nice stay,"This is a business hotel. Everything is punctual and orderly. Location is excellent for the convention center, LA Live and the Staples center. Room was large and tidy and modern. Wi fi worked great. There is a small coffee place in the lobby which serves Starbucks. There is also a pantry with all the essentials. There are lots of restaurants around so no problems to go out and grab a bite or a drink. The only thing I would recommend is to increase the water pressure on the high floors. I would probably stay here again next time I come to the convention center.",February 2020,Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles L.A.

Lovely tourist traps,Very touristic and filled with stores trying to sell the usual souvenirs. But still has a good vibe and some fine dining options sonits a must see both during the day and night.,October 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent food,Very lively place with lots of locals and tourists alike. Food was very good and service excellent. Very good for lunch in the center a short 2 minutes from Syntagma.

Nice music mediocre food,Wentbfor dinner. The place is lovely with an island Taverna atmosphere. They have live Greek music which is nice. We liked some of the food like the musaka and the eggplant salad butbthe taramasalata was mediocre and the mixed grill plate got mixed reviews I'm afraid. The lamb chop and the chicken breast weew fine but the beef and pork were overdone and dry. Prices are very moderate and the portions are generous. I guess if you stick to the lamb and traditional dishes like musaka gyros ans souvlaki you will be fine. Combined with the live music and good service its a good deal.,October 2019,Grill House Aischylou,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6740452-Reviews-Grill_House_Aischylou-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Intresting,Located in the ancient agora this temple is very well preserved. It is a shame they don't let you go inside but you can still inspect it from very close by. If you can close your eyes and imagine what it might have looked like at its prime and then add all the noises from the busy Agora market you can imagine old Athens from 450 BC... Strongly recommend for history buffs and it is included in the pricenof the combo ticket andbis very close to Monastriaki square so definitely go.,October 2019,Temple of Hephaestus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1064133-Reviews-Temple_of_Hephaestus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Pinnacle of Athens,Ehat elese can we say that hasn't been said. Its the center piece of the city and a must see attraction. I recommend to get the combo tickets at 30 euro each. they are valid for 5 days. Get them at the Agora or the Hedrian library as the lines there are much shorter to non existant. Also go either early morning or later in the afternoon as there are less people and it mat be less warm.

Must do,This is a must do item whether you are a history buff or not. Its brilliantly arranged and intresting. They also have a very nice coffee shop and restaurant so you can rest for a while. Take into account that the ticket is separate from the Acropolis itself and that in high season there may be a line for tickers. I highly recommend it after a visit to the Acropolis itself since it helps put things into perspective.,October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great hotel at a great location,Wonderful new hotel licated smack in the center of town about 200 m from syntagma square. Its on the main shopping pedestrian road and there are a lot of restaurants around. The Acropolis is 10 walking minutes away. Room was large clean and comfy. Breakfast was very good too. We also liked the rooftop restaurant for synset drinks and we even had dinner there one night which was great. All the waiting staff were great.

Wonderful hotel in a perfect location,"The hotel is in the middle of Mariahilfer strasse which is the main shopping street. Very close to all atreactions and there are plenty of dinning options around. So location is five star.

The room was very large quiet very well lit and clean.
All the staff and especially Tomas at the reception wefe vdry helpful.

Very nice,Had to wait in line for a while to be seated but it was beautiful in side. Very classy and 19th century design with large chandeliers and paintings and of course cakes. The coffee and cakes (we had the sacher cake and the apple strudel) were mediocre though and we did have better at cafe Ritter and also elsewhere.

OK but overpriced,Came for dinner and the place was packed. Good vibes and good music. Food wad Ok but over priced the Waggiu burgrer was well done instead of medium which I asked and the fries were plaim micky D type of fries. The mango mozzarella salad was very tasty but small.

Disappointing,"Came in hoping to get a good Indian dinner based on the previous reviews. While service was OK the food was mediocre at best. The mango Lassi and the nans were great but the other dishes we had were either bland or so salty that we couldn't finish them. I understand that things can happen but still it was too bad for us.

Impressive,"To avoid the lines I would suggest to use the on line site and purchase in advance. You can even pay with PayPal. If you also want to avoid the annoying queue at the baggage drop there are lockers in the basement near the bathroom.
The upper museum is a must see. The kiss and the other works by Klimt are amazing as are some of those by Schiele. There is a little section of impressionists also so that was a bonus.

OK but not great,Came for dinner with reservations so we were readily seated. Service was very good and attentive although only one waitress seemed to be present. The burgers were OK but certainly not the best ever as some fellow reviewers stated. The onion rings were not crunchy enough and the home made ketchup was a bit weird for me. The atmosphere was nice and so was the music.

Great stay,"What a wonderful hotel. We felt very wellcomed right from our arrival and throughout our stay. Reception staff were very friendly and eager to help. The suite was large enogh for me and my daughter and was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was OK but could be improved with a larger selection of cheese and cold cuts. Free coffee and sparkling and still water throughout the day was a very welcomed feature and we also liked the in suite kitchen and the nespresso machine. Location is close to Vauxhall metro 5 minute walk and from there to Oxford circusnits just a straight shoot with the Victoria line for 4 stops and 7 minutes.

Wonderful PHO,What a find. We were passing by and ready for dinner and stopped on a whim. So happy we did. Great service and great Pho soup. It was so similar to Vietnam that if you close your eyes you can imagine you're on the street in Hanoi having a Pho (it turned out the Chef is indeed Vietnamese!!!). The Vietnamese beer was a major plus. We also tried the bubble coffee and the bubble tea which were great. Great value for money.

There was no aircon butbthe rooms are bright and airy and there is a good wind so it wasn't really needed. There is a small lake at the edge of the gardens and even some horses.

The bed is comfy and the shower was great with Mugler products. We were awaken by pigeons making noise just outside the window...
Breakfast was quite OK with a nice variety. Location is close to the train station whcich may be a bit dodgy tonsome. Its right opposite the Garden du plants but the garden closes at 8:30pm so you can't short cut through. Having said that city center is about 10-15 minutes by foot and the art museum about 5 minutes.

Marselline, The main dishes, a bit more problematic: the roast beef was OK if a bit dry and overcooked but the rib steak was filled with fat and not as tasty as it should have been.

OK for a four star,"Location is quite good and close to the Centrale station (500m) and the Gioya metro (250m) so easy to get around town. We arrived on time and our room was ready which we found to be a plus. We booked a suite and were told we were upgraded to a king suite which we thought was great. However, the room layout was strange with a very living and useless corridor a very small rectangular living room wich in effect was quite useless as such and a medium size bedroom. When we asked for a change of rooms they (Alessandro I think was the guy on the phone) said that for a larger suite we had to add 150 Euro per night. hmmmm. Now, we originally booked the hotel on Accor as it was called the Sofitel and I have a frequent traveller with them but then the hotel changed its name from Sofitel to Hyatt and I had to call several times to cancel the reservation on accor and make a new one on Hyatt and they kept messing up my reservation on the Hyatt site. Given all the trouble I had with the reservation process (all documented) I thought they'll offer a free upgrade especially since I am used to the Sofitel standards but maybe its just me (or maybe this is Hyatt's way of saying Hi and Welcome).....
All the other staff members at reception, breakfast etc were very nice and helpful. The room was clean, the AC worked fine as did the WiFi. Breakfast was very good but served exactly the same menu for all the 5 nights we stayed. Overall, it was a good stay except for the overpriced and somewhat disappointing room which was not a good value for money because if you pay for a suite you expect to get one and also expect to be treated more nicely (but I understand its only one guy)......This is why I only rate it as a 4 and not 5.",May 2019,Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187849-d6820820-Reviews-Hyatt_Centric_Milan_Centrale-Milan_Lombardy.html,"Milan, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0

Tbe Bellagio pasta dish was a great choice and the Steaks were grilled to perfection. House winevwas decent as well. Atmosphere is calm and on a nice night you can eat outside in a small courtyard. Prices are moderate. Definitely recommend.,May 2019,Osteria Fara,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187849-d4788657-Reviews-Osteria_Fara-Milan_Lombardy.html,"Milan, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5

beautiful settings but average food,"The place is very elegant and very well decorated which makes for a very pleasant place to eat and chat. The food was just OK, we had a nice goat cheese salad and the crawl fish soup and then a roast beef which were all OK but not great. Bread selection was very nice and tasty. Service was great and our waiter was funny and professional at once.",April 2019,Rest.

OK but a little dated,"Stayed there for 3 nights on a business trip. The hotel is 5 minutes from the airport. Taxi to city center is around 30-40 Zloti. The reception people were very nice as well the waiting staff at breakfast. The rooms are a little worn and should have a makeover. Also, the towels were a little worn. Overall, the rooms are OK for size and cleanliness. Breakfast was very good with a wide selection and made to order omelettes etc.
Its a 4 star hotel with a rating of 4 that would be significantly upgraded with a refurbishment.",April 2019,Airport Hotel Okecie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274856-d276991-Reviews-Airport_Hotel_Okecie-Warsaw_Mazovia_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Warsaw, Poland",hotels,4.0,4.0

Very good tour with Josep,We took a tour of the vineyard and the Winery with the wine tasting. Josep was great. So knowledgeable and patient. Wines are great and do hold up to their reputation. The clos mogador and the Nelin were fantastic. Its a great way to learn about wine making in Priorat.

So tasty,Very nice setup. Very convinient on the outskirts of Gratallops. Ample parking. We had the lunch menu with wine tasting. Food was great. We liked the lamb chops and country pathe and salad. So much choice and si fresh. Probably the best lunch in the area. Definite must.

Great little hotel,Great place to stay when visiting the Priorat wine counth. Located just outside gratallops its perfect for the most important wineries of the area. Only 7 rooms to this charming place which is located withina winery. You can try their wines. Rooms are small but very nicely appointed and lack for nothing. Views from thenrooms ans from the common xeck area are stunning. Breakfast is good also. The only downside is that there is no restaurant nearby and all the restaurants in Gratallops were closed for dinner sonwe had to go to Alma Mater which turned out as an excellent surprise but you can't get there without a car.,March 2019,Trossos del Priorat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616245-d7311426-Reviews-Trossos_del_Priorat-Gratallops_Province_of_Tarragona_Catalonia.html,"Gratallops, Spain",hotels,5.0,5.0
Great food and atmosphere,Yammi food. Just delicious. The place is packed by locals and tiurists on a nightly basis. Came on two consecutive nights until we were able to secure a place on the bar. Great service feom the barmans. Full of humor and fun. Great little tapas like the shrimp and langustine salad and the octopus. Beef steak with the foix gras also delicious. Best tapas I had. Moderately priced. They are so good it's no surprise they are packed.,March 2019,Ciudad Condal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d1059712-Reviews-Ciudad_Condal-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
