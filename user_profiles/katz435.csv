Via Rail you suck,"The trip across Canada was a highlight of our trip. We broke trip in two parts. First train arrived in Jasper 36 hours late and the 2nd train 29 hours late.

Via Rail do not keep you informed on what is happening, offer you inadequate meal vouchers if you are in the station and all they say it is because of freight trains. Even if you love train travel this trip is stressful and impacts on you trip SIGNIFICANTLY.

- the driving is madness, just don't look
- yes way too much food, not authentic Vietnamese but nothing really wrong with it
- yes there is plastic wrapped cheese but we have seen this elsewhere so think it might be more Vietnamese than you think
