Overpriced and half hearted lazy service,"Ate at this restaurant and was pretty disappointed . Wanted to sit inside as we visited in December but the old waitstaff said that there was no seat indoors even though the seats were half empty inside. These seats remained empty for the over 1.5hours we were there . I think he reserved seats for his favorite customers .

We were plonked on a table meant for 4 people but he kept insisting that 5 people could fit in. After finally showing him that it is not possible, he merely said ‘sorry, don’t understand ‘ . That was going to be his favorite phrase the whole evening . After we were squashed on an obviously small table for 4, he passed the menu to us. We ordered our food and later as we asked to remove one order, he resorted to his famous phase ‘sorry don’t understand’ . As we ate the food, we noticed that customers around us were receiving complimentary plates of desserts such as Blakava . We struggled to finish our food and as the helpings were too large, we asked for the food to be packed so that we can give the food to the needy. The old guy grumbled and gave us aluminum foils instead to bring back the food. When we asked for the bill, the guy was insistent that we must tip him. I asked to lay by credit card and he said, ‘sorry, don’t understand ‘ and later card machine not working and insisted on cash .

For a restaurant that caters to Rick steves readers, it amuses me that he doesn’t understand English nor that there is no credit card machine and very ungreek to ask for a tip. I think Rick Steve’s book has spoilt this restaurant and the owner is getting a little big headed. Not an authentic Greek food and we all agreed that this was the must unpleasant and overrated restaurant we have eaten in our stay in Greece. Dont bother to eat, there are better restaurants nearby who treats customers in a respectable manner .",December 2019,Geros Tou Moria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1840495-Reviews-Geros_Tou_Moria-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Great place to eat where locals eat at wallet friendly prices,"Spent €3 per person eating slouvaki at a table in the middle of Athens without burning your wallet. The food here was great that we ended up eating here twice in 2 days . We tried the variety of food and it was cheap and good . We ordered the slouvaki as well as the kebabs and they were delicious together with the white dipping sauce which you eat with French fries . For 5 of us, the bill came to about €30 for a very filling meal. The helping ate huge though .

Nice place to eat Greek food.,"Nice place to eat Greek food. We had the usual suspects - Greek Salad, Mousaka , Mutton with pasta, Steamed fish, Blakava, another type of dessert related to Blakava, Greek beer and Greek coffee. Food tasted and looked exactly like Turkish food, but don’t tell that to the Greeks. Fish was rather bony and with the poor lighting ended up eating some bones .

Service was helpful in providing with suggestions. The helpings were relatively large and the 5 of us shared 4 dishes which was more than enough. Paid about €50 for the meal including tips.

The old sites as well as the beta where St Paul was tried by the Roman’s still stand.

Great visit to see the Corinthian city as well as the Bema,"Wanted to visit this city for 2 reasons- St Paul’s visit to the Corinthian and his famous letter of love written for the early Christian population in this city . Managed to see that. Another reason was that the Corinthian were a middle power in Ancient Greece compared to the superpower status of Athens and Sparta and we wanted to see what their city looked like in the past .

Place was pretty deserted as we visited it during winter which made it even more atmospheric. Entrance fee was €4 for non EU people .

Expected for centrally located 3 star hotel for €75 a night,"Gave 5 stars by virtue of the fact that this hotel is centrally located 3 star hotel that can accommodate a triple room and cost about €85 for the triple and €75 for a double with breakfast included.

The very positive points:
1) very helpful staff who would go out of their way to help you to know more about Athens and who try to accede to your request.
2) centrally located hotel within 10-12 minutes walk of all that is significant in Athens . Think of the hotel as the Centre of a rectangle with the Agora, Acropolis, Temple of Olympian Zeus and Sygtama Square as corners of the rectangle . Very walkable area.
3) Good filling breakfast and polite and proactive staff . These alone meet the excellent ratings .
4) Safe area in Athens

The points below are suggestions for improvements. For a good price I got, I am not complaining about the hotel as it is not a 5 star hotel.
1) poor sound proofing of windows so you hear the sound of the city, garbage trucks and loud Greeks in the middle of the night.
2) Lighting is too dim so difficult to read at night
3) Shower tray always leak out water as the rubber tubing have worn away resulting in Wet bathrooms after every bath.

Don’t bother 8€ admission fees,"After you have visited the Acropolis €10, Ancient Agora €5 and Acropolis Museum €5 for Non EU residents and during winter period, the €8 admission fee to see a Roman temple ruin is simply ridiculous and won’t understand why people would want to pay that amount of money to visit. Moreover, you need not go inside to see the site as you can merely go near the fenced up area near the entrance after the traffic lights and take a few pictures from there to see the site.

Layout of the place is great with pictures and illustrations highlighting what the place looked like before it was turned into ruins.

In truth, the Agora looks very similar to the Ronan Forum in Rome in terms of similarity of design and size . The site has a good toilet and water fountain as .

Poorly restored building with a modern crane inside it?,"This is supposed to be the symbol of Athens but the manner in which the authorities are restoring it is such an eyesore and sad. A historical building with a modern crane nestled in the interior of the pathenon is such an insult- imagine a crane inside the Abraham Lincoln memorial in Washington DCir or the Taj Mahal building in Agra.

I expect the authorities to take better care of these sites but I guess it explains why the Acropolis is not listed as a site of one of the new 7 wonders of the world.

Pretty expensive to see ruins if you are from a Non EU country,"Admission fee during winter is €10 per person for above 5 if you are from a non EU country. Pretty expensive to see ruins that should have been better restored . Essentially it is an empty shell as the pollution brought about by the city gas decayed much of the structures more than the invasions, wars this site experienced . The Parthenon was a disgrace as being a super important site to the Western World, has a crane inside the structure that negates and blemishes the importance of the site.

Great museum because of religious significance,"Museum worth visiting only because of the Sistine chapel. Sistine chapel is where the popes are elected after the previous pope passes away. Also because of michaelangelo wall and ceiling paintings . This is the reason why you should visit this museum.

All the other attractions - paintings, sculptors etc... are similar to any world class museums.

Contains remains of Peter, the first pope, plus the remains of subsequent popes as well as art pieces of Michelangelo called the Pieta. Definitely worth your time to visit.

Just note that outside the church is a completely new world of touts selling imitation stuff and pirate taxis who will fleeced you at the taxi stands charging you 2-3 times above the official rate . These pirate taxis work as a cartel where the route will approach you and give you a jacked up price.

We were placed in the rooms on the 5th floor with views of the adjacent church . The rooms were very large as we had a triple room but as we visited in winter, the size of the room and the fact that the rooms are on the top meant that the rooms were always cold .

The heater couldn’t keep the rooms warm, the lightings were a little faulty and when we tried to turn in the bathroom heater at 1 of the rooms, the heater emitted smoke and a plastic burning smell that we had to switch off the heater .

In short, take the Grand Canal Cruise by water bus all the way from the train station to St Mark Square .

Great place to reach via a hike from botanical gardens .,"We decided to go to Penang hill by the active way- we hiked up and took a tram down.

We started our hike from Moongate 5, at the botanical gardens and took a 3 hour hike up to the top. The first 30 minutes was a killer hike as we had to climb stairs to the Moongate station 5 rest area. After Moongate 5, we used the toilet and washing facilities to freshen up before we hiked about an hour plus in the forest to station 84. The hike was a lot more pleasant as it was shaded and cool moving in higher altitude. At station 84, we reached the 4WD tarmac road and walked the last 2.4km on this toad which took about 45 minutes . When we reached the top, the place was swarming with tourists but we rewarded ourselves with mango snow ice cream for our achievement. We got a discount as we hiked instead of tramming up.

We were too busted at the top as we needed to check out if our hotel by noon. So we took an express lane tram down the hill. The ticket was RM45 per non Malaysian but we needed not to line up and were the first ones to sit at the tram to get the best seats for the views down.

Good:
1) Wonderful staff in all areas- especially the restaurant staff, check in staff and cleaning staff with their warm penangnite hospitality. They will try to accede to your requests and anticipate your needs.
2) Wonderful child minding staff and good range of activities organized by the children’s club . Children had a great time there.
3) Excellent transportation link with hotel Jen , Shangrila hotels with drop off at Gurney Plaza .
4) Reasonably priced food with decent prices at the cafe

Not good:
1) Very poor sound proofing- room 539 was at traffic junction and mosque- forced to sleep only near midnight and wake up by 0550 due to external noise
2) facilities a little run down with a poorly equipped gym and furniture that is very 1980s.

Great stay with great staff and facilities,"We went there in June that was hot and dry. We chose to do half day tour before retreating to the hotel in the afternoon. To relax by the pool, work out in the gym, eat restaurant food.

The hotel was very decent price which was a plus. Moreover the location was away from Luxor meaning that it was quiet. Also the staff were very helpful and always willing to render their assistance. If there was one issue was that whenever we ordered our meals, somehow the wait staff will mess up in 1 order. Other than that I will return to Hilton Luxor should I return . Also note that this hotel is classified as 5 star but to International standards , more likely four stars .

Super peaceful visit,"We went during the late afternoon. The temple was empty and we had the while place to ourselves . As it was partially sheltered , a good place to visit and enjoy looking at this monument in the shade. Entrance fee is 80 Egyptian pounds per person . Go there to look at the wall relief .

Great visit to this temple,We enjoyed visiting the temple because of the story behind this temple with propaganda on how god-like Hatshepsut was. The wall relief and carvings were interesting.

Reason why we are in Luxor,"Must see attraction at 200 Egyptian Pounds- the entrance to 3 tombs is rotated . We visited Meranptah, Ramses the 3rd and Ramses the 4th tombs. They were okay tombs for the basic admission tickets . To us, Ramses the 6th tomb was the best but that is a separate tickets at 100 Egyptian pounds . Additionally, the much hyped Tutankhamun tomb was an additional 250 Egyptian pounds which was not worth the admission fees. Photography fee is an additional 300 Egyptian pound . So after counting all the extras, it a really cheap visit .

Great tour with Ash for 2 Days,"We used EMO tours as they provide good value tours that are inclusive, transparent and good guide .

We booked the East Bank tour as well as the West Bank tour in separate days so as not to get exhausted. The tour guide, Ash provided a good tour that allowed us to see the sites in a more lively manner rather than just looking at stone monuments. The fare we laid was very fair as it is a little more that the admission fees, car with driver as well as refreshments .

The company was very punctual and transparent. We are not interested in visiting the normal tourist shops such as the alabaster and papyrus ‘factories’ and we were not forced nor compelled to visit them .

I recommend this company as they provide decent prices, are transparent, have great guides and have some flexibility . Pay a little more to escape the hassle of booking an independent trip.

If there is one area that can be improved is for the company to allow the customers to
be more flexible in what they wish to see. For example, after a rather quick visit to the valley of the kings , the temple of the Hatshepsut and photo stop at colossi of memnon, we wanted a quick visit to take a few photos of Medinet Habu and the Ramesssseum, which are just 1km away from the colossi of memnon and ticket office, the guide was not able to do that as EMO wanted to charge US$80 just to visit these 2 sites for less than an hour (which is more than the entire half day tour we booked). We were even keen to pay for our own admission tickets and visit the site on our own, without the guide but no go. To Ash’s credit he stopped the car outside these places for a quick 30 second snap before moving off .

We then chose to visit the same 2 sites on the next day on our own and took a 3 hour camel tour with all transportation charges at less than US$80 .",June 2019,Emo Tours Egypt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294205-d2322949-Reviews-Emo_Tours_Egypt-Luxor_Nile_River_Valley.html,"Luxor, Egypt",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Worth a visit, mind the vendors","You are in Egypt for this reason . Worth to book a tour with a tour guide to bring out the history of the place . We used EMO tours and were very happy . Secondly, a tour guide will somewhat chase the vendors away allowing you to enjoy your experience with these 4000 year old wonders. Entrance is 150 Egyptian Pounds and you need admission tickets to the pyramids that range from 100 to 240 to enter these pyramids. Descending to to bs is unpleasant, hot and tight. Recommend you visit the pyramids at Saqqara for a more pleasant experience .",June 2019,Pyramids of Giza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294202-d317746-Reviews-Pyramids_of_Giza-Giza_Giza_Governorate.html,"Giza, Egypt",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good day trips with EMO Tours,"Booked all my Day Egypt trips with EMO for the Cairo and Luxor area as well as all the transfers to and from the city airports .

EMO tours ticked all the boxes for our criterion when we book private tours- 1) well priced tours, 2) Transparent pricing 3) Good guides 4) Flexibility based on interest .

1) We looked at other tour agencies and EMO tours were very competitive. They charged good rates and you pay a little extra more for convenience, safety and escape from the hassle of the touts that swarm all the attractions instead of independent self travel .

2) pricing was very transparent with what was included and excluded . After doing a back of envelop calculation, after discounting admission fees , food, car and driver rental, you are simply paying a few dollars more than independent graveling minus the hassle of self travel .

3) We had Mido who was an excellent guide who essentially answered all our questions and who explained all the attractions in Giza and Cairo well . We were very happy with his service and his ability to personalize the trip according to our interest .

4) Mido was aware that we are not interested in those inevitable tourist shops to view perfumes or carpets and respected our decisions not to visit those places . He also entered the itinerary so that we were not exposed to the hottest part of the day and was a good photographer as well .

EMO Tours met our expectations and brought the attractions to Egypt alive. Will recommend to my friends should they choose to visit Egypt . Hence a 5 star review . If there is one area EMO can improve on is their responsiveness to WhatsApp and SMS as they hardly reply to them and it can be quite disconcerting to customers if the intended pickup by their company will happen .",June 2019,Emo Tours Egypt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294202-d1856892-Reviews-Emo_Tours_Egypt-Giza_Giza_Governorate.html,"Giza, Egypt",attractions,5.0,5.0
3 star hotel passing off as a 5 star hotel,"Pros: hotel has great pyramid view rooms so a high floor with pyramid view rooms are priceless . You are in Cairo for a reason and hence the location of this hotel is key . You can watch the pyramids in the comfort of your room

Cons: 1) Poor and indifferent service: very weird policy of bottled water . If request for 2 bottles of water to be delivered , it is free. If 4 bottles, must pay . As such, must request 2 bottles each time which is a little strange . Also staff lacks initiative and will somewhat always forget your requests.

2) Horrible bathroom - water spills out of the tub and floods the floor . Bath tub is super dirty . Had to change room as first room had a busted door that can’t close .

3)Dirty carpets - place in need of renovation

4) Terrible WiFi - WiFi drops very frequently . For a business hotel - this is unacceptable

5) Exploitative taxi or airport transport . 800 Egyptian pounds for a 1 way ride to airport. Uber cost 200 Egyptian pounds (which you may not get with their horrible WiFi) , tour companies charge 400 Egyptian pounds which means that this is the most value for money and safe option.

Will not stay at this hotel again . Good to simply stay at the room and look at the pyramids as the pool and spa is not welcoming as well .",June 2019,Le Meridien Pyramids Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294202-d496737-Reviews-Le_Meridien_Pyramids_Hotel_Spa-Giza_Giza_Governorate.html,"Giza, Egypt",hotels,2.0,4.0
"Very romantic, nice view and reasonable prices","I am very weary of restaurants that have very high ranking in TripAdvisor and 90% of the reviews are done by customers who have only a review ad have given 5 stars in order to get freebies from the establishments . If you check some of these restaurants in Istanbul there are quite a number of these establishments. The other 10% of the reviews with more than 5 review will ultimately have a lot less positive reviews and you know that these restaurants are highly suspect .

I am glad to note that this restaurant lives up to its good ranking . The food is well priced and are in fact cheaper than the surrounding touristic restaurants . The atmosphere is very romantic with great views of the Bosphorus and Hagia Sophia - very romantic at night. Thirdly the evening entertainment was of good quality and we enjoyed the great singer . Lastly, the food is good to the extent that we visited the restaurant 3 times - once eating at this restaurant and the other 2 times visiting the sultaniah restaurant of their sister restaurant that essentially serves most of the same food and similar prices .

If you like a boutique hotel with great hospitality, middle of the road prices, comfortable and clean rooms, romantic atmosphere , excellent central location where all attractions and public transport options are walking distance, this hotel and the surrounding hotels will be an ideal location.

This hotel ticks all the correct criterion and that was why I chose it and gave it a 5 star review.

It is just that the hotel staff keeps trying to promote the hotel and blatantly ask to give 5 stars so that they will be ranked amongst the top hotels in Istanbul that it can be very tiresome . It is this reason that their sister hotels and their attached restaurants are all consistently ranked as amongst the top hotels and restaurants in TripAdvisor . Just be aware of that it is very sad that a website originally intended to help independent tourists have become so commercialized and exploited as a free marketing tool that it somewhat takes away the beauty of this hotel .

The food was simply great. Enjoyed the black beluga caviar at only 2200r per person . The burgundy wine was smooth and well worth the 800roubles per glass . We ate the beef tartare and he was great. Likewise the main dishes of duck and beef was simply outstanding . We enjoyed the last part- which was the dessert and they were simply great. The whole bill came to €90 for 2 which is considered great value for the type of food we ate. Ambience was great though finding the place may be a little tricky .

You will need to clear security twice but I will take this option from Moscow to St Petersburg or vice-verse due to the convenience of the train as it starts and terminates at the train station unlike the airports. Moreover the price is only about US$38 person and is very good value .

Also its location at Tallinn is also a bit out of the way compared to the other cruise lines .",December 2018,Tallink and Silja Line - Cruises,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d4431766-Reviews-Tallink_and_Silja_Line_Cruises-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,4.0,4.0
Nice hub of transportation,"Great place to base yourself at one of the surrounding hotels as you are right in the hub- the trains, buses, trams all originate and terminate at this area as well as the departmental stores surround the station . Also the architecture is pretty post modern and Soviet looking but it adds to the attractiveness of the building . A very functional place rather than an attraction .",December 2018,Helsinki Central Railway Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d245975-Reviews-Helsinki_Central_Railway_Station-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,3.0,4.0
It us just an empty square !!,"Nothing much to see here as it us essentially a place where they set up a Christmas market and a portable Suana. However, compared to the main squares in Copenhagen, Stockholm and even Tallinn, this is most certainly the most boring square and one of the smallest as well. Worth a photo stop to take a few Khufu’s before moving on to other attractions .",December 2018,Senate Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d245976-Reviews-Senate_Square-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,2.0,4.0
Pretty small market hall for tourists,"Visited this market hall in the morning. There are about 30-40 shops selling fresh produce and food though it caters more to the tourists. In fact, the food seem more expensive here than other places as I guess they are more tourist orientated that middle eastern as well as Vietnamese food are sold as well. I visited the Stockmen department stall gourmet level and the variety of food at the departmental stall are more varied as well as cheaper. Hence don’t bother visiting this site if you are visiting Stockmen.",December 2018,Old Market Hall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d314921-Reviews-Old_Market_Hall-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,2.0,4.5
Nice church from the outside,"A very iconic church that is very eye catching as it is located on a hill at debate square with its cute green colour.

Other than that, the interior is pretty austere and functional. A nice place to drop by for 10-15 mi jets before moving on to other sites. Sites in Helsinki are pretty limited .",December 2018,Helsinki Cathedral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d202596-Reviews-Helsinki_Cathedral-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,3.0,4.0
Seriously overpriced to see an empty church,"How can this attraction be an attraction? You pay €3 to enter a church that is essentially dynamited out from rock. Being a church, personally I am against paying to enter a place of worship and I do t see why there is a need to pay an admission price to visit this place.

Didn’t no more than 5 -10 minutes and we were bored . Don’t waste your time going here .",December 2018,Temppeliaukio Church,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d1372894-Reviews-Temppeliaukio_Church-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,1.0,4.5
Excellent way to get around Helsinki during cold weather,"Helsinki is a very walkable city and you need not spend money paying for expensive taxis going from point A to B.

The team lines are pretty well organized - I think there are up to 9 tram lines and they all cross cross each other especially near the train station. As such, this hub and spoke method allows you to easily go from point A to B it be city at a very rapid time . Buy the day pass at €9 for 24 hours of travel and you get to see all the sites within the city by that time . A very economical way to travel. During winter time when it us snowing, it is a good alternative to walking . Buy the tickets from the kiosks or from ticket machines .",December 2018,Helsinki Tram System,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d9736351-Reviews-Helsinki_Tram_System-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Pretty Christmas market in December,Nice Christmas market at the town square with a very carnival like atmosphere. It makes the town a lot liver. The lighting at night creates a romantic atmosphere as well when you walk along the cobbled streets . Food and shops are pretty reasonable priced compared to the other Nordic countries which explains why the place is jammed jacked with Finnish people getting their alcohol fix enroute as well as in Tallinn .,December 2018,Tallinna Raekoja Plats,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274958-d290207-Reviews-Tallinna_Raekoja_Plats-Tallinn_Harju_County.html,"Tallinn, Estonia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Pleasant and atmospheric place in December,"Went there by Tallink ferry from Helsinki and spent 3 hours in the old town . If you wish to walk around, 3 hours will suffice. But if you wish to visit their museums as well as have a sit down dinner and tea, you will certainly need a full day .

Personally, more sights to see than Helsinki. The Christmas market area is pretty pleasant and more lively than the Helsinki area. Just note that if you are taking a ferry, it is about a 1km hike to Fat Margaret - which is the entrance to the old town as the area is under renovation and lots of detours abound. Hence quite tiring walking there and back and walking on the cobbles streets can be painful to your feet . If I were to return there, will probably spent the whole day there or even an overnight stay .",December 2018,Tallinn Old Town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274958-d276610-Reviews-Tallinn_Old_Town-Tallinn_Harju_County.html,"Tallinn, Estonia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice place to learn about Sami Culture as well as to sleigh ride,"Yes this place is super touristy with about two hundred tourists descending a day and the reindeers are super adorable, cute and gentle.

Yes the price can be super expensive but this is Norway and besides hunting the Northern lights. Sleighing in either a reindeer or a pack of dogs, there is not much left to do in this city . Nevertheless we enjoyed ourselves a lot on this short tour and is a once in a lifetime experience.

Do remember to do the sleigh rides and you will have fun.",December 2018,Tromso Arctic Reindeer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190475-d7929825-Reviews-Tromso_Arctic_Reindeer-Tromso_Troms_Northern_Norway.html,"Tromso, Norway",attractions,5.0,5.0
Loved the lunch and dessert here!!,"Great place to chill out here from the cold. They had a wonderful fish and mussel soup that we both enjoyed very much . It was pretty filling for the 2 of us. The dessert - the cheesecake dessert was super delicious and we both scrapped off the plate all the crumbs from the cake. Very friendly, cosy place to stay warm.

Got to see what we came to see for both nights,"Booked this company as they have a good reputation for being persistent in chasing the light. Managed to see the lights on both nights and luckily all near Tromso and need not have to drive to Finland. Booked the big bus tour because of my personality style .

1) has a toilet that is clean onboard

2) strong WiFi that keeps you connected

3) heated bus if you are the type who can’t tolerate cold too long

4) decent value since a big bus tour is about 60% that of a small bus tour - so good if you are watching your wallet and traveling with family

5) Not a very sociable person and prefer to travel with 30 over people and need not talk 2-3 hours over a fire with your fellow travelers in a small group

6) provide the same type of service as the small group tour- photography, same enthusiasm, same service and after sale services.

Based on these criterion, chasing lights delivered on all of these and we left very happy with the services they provided .

If I return to Tromso or if my friends recommend from me which tour to take, I will not hesitate to recommend this tour hands down !!!",December 2018,Chasing Lights,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190475-d5505910-Reviews-Chasing_Lights-Tromso_Troms_Northern_Norway.html,"Tromso, Norway",attractions,5.0,5.0
Basic hotel that meets your basic demands,"Stayed here for 3 nights and was a decent hotel that provided full board for your stay.

Positives:
1) Full board provided for breakfast, tea and a light dinner . Can be a money saver if you are watching your wallet for the super expensive tours you take to hunt the northern lights as well as the US$12 Burger King meals.

2) Hospitable staff that were polite and helped you with the queries

3) Near a central location so walking distance to any part of Tromsø are just a few minutes away.

4) Go for twin bedded rooms as they are bigger and more room to walk around

Negatives:
1) super small and basic gym that has machines that are old, faulty or inadequate to do proper work outs. The gym / sauna is not working and people who have checked out but need to wash up will use the bathing facilities there . So a bit awkward to work out whilst people are changing or bathing in the same room

2) House keeping could be on top of their game by providing full range of soap, towels, mats but somehow these are missing on some days .

3) Beds are somewhat lumpy and soft",December 2018,Clarion Collection Hotel With,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190475-d206350-Reviews-Clarion_Collection_Hotel_With-Tromso_Troms_Northern_Norway.html,"Tromso, Norway",hotels,4.0,4.5
