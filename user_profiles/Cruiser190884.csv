Did not really need this ticket in January,"In January the lines are not that long. We would not have had a wait if we had just bought our tickets there. The pickup place is not 3 minute walk away as indicated. Luckily we were on a private tour and he parked right in front of ticket office to pick them up. If going during the summer I would highly recommend this, but if you are going in off season my suggestion is just by tickets there.",January 2020,Skip the Line: Acropolis of Athens Admission Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d15005568-Skip_the_Line_Acropolis_of_Athens_Admission_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,3.0,3.5
