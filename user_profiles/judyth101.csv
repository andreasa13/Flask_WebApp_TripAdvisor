BC Ferries have their ups and downs,"the BC Ferry system has many variations. from the big ferries going from the mainland to various islands and especially Vancouver Island. on these ferries you are able to pay for an advance reservation which is worth the expense...if you get to the ferry terminal in time. then there are the smaller ferries between various islands where there is no reservation system and sometimes one has to wait through one or more sailing to get on.

the area is beautiful and the trips are definitely worth the time and trouble and expense.....and sometimes they are the only way you can get to where you want to be.",January 2020,BC Ferries,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g181772-d184078-Reviews-BC_Ferries-Sidney_Victoria_Capital_Regional_District_Vancouver_Island_British_Colu.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",attractions,4.0,4.0

The Best Place to stay in Campbell River,"I pass through Campbell River on Vancouver Island, B.C., Canada often and i have stayed at many of the hotels in the area. last August i stayed at Heron's Landing Hotel for a few nights and was thrilled to discover that in the breakfast area there are two hot plates and the ingredients for guests to make their own omelette. how unusual! i had never been offered that by any other hotel anywhere (and i travel a lot). there was grated cheese, green onions, red peppers, etc., all cut up and ready for use. it was wonderful to be able to eat an omelette the way i like it; rather than the common scrambled eggs that are often too hard and cold and tasting stale. i stayed at Heron's Landing again in january, 2020, and it was again the nicest, most friendly and accommodating hotel in the area. it is reasonably priced and all of the staff that i have met are superior. i have finally found my home away from home in Campbell River!",January 2020,Heron's Landing Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g181792-d674511-Reviews-Heron_s_Landing_Hotel-Campbell_River_Vancouver_Island_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",hotels,5.0,4.0
