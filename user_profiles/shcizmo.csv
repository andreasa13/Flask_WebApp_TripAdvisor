Great stay!,"We enjoyed our stay in Hilton Athens. Our room was spacious and clean, the breakfast buffet had quite a lot of variety.

Ok for one night,"Stayed in this hotel as part of our 2 day 1 night tour to Delphi and Meteora organised by key tours. Room was simple, clean and not big. However, the basin in my room was dirty and a little clogged. Was thinking if I should tell the receptionist about it but decided not to since we were only staying for one night. Hotel's dinner and breakfast was decent. This place would be good enough for 1 or 2 nights but I would choose another hotel if I were to stay longer.",December 2019,Orfeas Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315843-d506589-Reviews-Orfeas_Hotel-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",hotels,3.0,3.5
Try their truffle pasta!,"We ordered their truffle pasta after reading good reviews about it. It was really delicious!

Perfect place to watch sunset,"Stopped at the Imerovigli bus stop and walked from there to Skaros Rock. We couldn't get to the top as it was during winter time and the winds were very strong. Nonetheless, the view from nearby was just as awesome!

Great place to learn about wine making,"Saw lots of good reviews on this museum so we decided to check this place out. We paid 10 Euros per pax for a tour around their underground museum, which included an audio guide in our preferred language, as well as tasting of 4 of their different wines. We were the first 2 visitors on that day and there weren't anybody else after us for quite a while, so we could walk around the museum and listen to the audio guide at a comfortable pace. We learnt a great deal about the history and about wine making, and enjoyed the wine tasting very much.

Great view of the Caldera from view,"This hotel has a great view of the Caldera, which we never got sick of during our 4 nights of stay there. It was so beautiful! Breakfast was basically the same for all mornings, hard boiled eggs, bread with spread provided and yogurt, but was adequate for us. Location wise, it's a 10 min walk from the main town of Fira where you can take the local bus to all the other towns in Santorini. They seem to lack in manpower, but the staff are still helpful when it comes to queries. Would recommend this place if you want affordable stay in Santorini with the amazing Caldera view.",November 2019,Manos Small World,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635607-d630203-Reviews-Manos_Small_World-Firostefani_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5

Less than 10 min walk to the Akropoli Metro station and attractions like the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum. Lots of cafes and restaurants nearby too.

Food was delicious and affordable,"We ate here once during dinner. Ordered the meat platter and zucchini balls, both of which were yummy! Though I felt the food could be a little less charred.

Nice Place for Seeing Local's Everyday Life,"We came here for a walk on a Friday night. The lights there were relatively dim but it gets full of life during the night.

Loved their Sausages and Fried Crickets!,"We came here for dinner as our friend recommended this place for Lao food. We ordered their platter, morning glory, fried crickets and salted egg fried rice. Out of those we ordered, I especially liked their sausage from the platter and fried crickets, something I never would have thought I would eat! There will be a live band playing after 8.30pm as well so it'll be good to hang around there a while.

Ok for a Night's Stay,"We stayed here for a night during our stopover in Vang Vieng. The room had the basic facilities we needed but there were stains on the bed sheet. The walls weren't too clean either. Also, if you're a light sleeper, this place may not suitable for you. People come back late at night and we could hear them clearly from inside our room. Since we were only staying for one night, we were ok with it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're intending to stay longer.",December 2017,Vangvieng Central Park Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g612363-d10537560-Reviews-Vangvieng_Central_Park_Hotel-Vang_Vieng_Vientiane_Province.html,"Vang Vieng, Laos",hotels,3.0,4.0
Loved it!,"We came here on a Monday afternoon and there were quite a number of tourists but not too overwhelming. We were still able to take some decent pictures of the waterfalls without having too many people at the background. There are 3 main tiers of waterfalls in all. All 3 tiers were beautiful but we particularly loved the 2nd one! The 3rd one was the one where people could dive in and take a dip in the pool. Even if you do not want to swim in it, this place is still worth a visit for its beautiful waters. :)",December 2017,Kuang Si Falls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d555731-Reviews-Kuang_Si_Falls-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html,"Luang Prabang, Laos",attractions,5.0,4.5

Interesting Experience for us,"This visit was an interesting one for us as we do not see a lot of such markets back in our country. Compared to their night market, the morning market sells mostly food stuff. This was the place where we did most of our shopping too.

Interesting Sight for us,"We woke up early in the morning just so we could witness this special ceremony. We did not buy the sticky rice to put in the monks' alms, but we followed them from the moment they came out of the temple and witnessed other tourists sitting down and giving out sticky rice to them. The whole ceremony will end within one hour or so.

As Interesting as their Morning Market,"Unlike the morning market which sells mostly food stuff, the night market sells both food and items like clothings, magnets, slippers, diaries, and many more. This would be an ideal place to get souvenirs. Many stalls sell similar items but their designs vary. You can bargain for more discount if you buy more from them too. We came here on all 3 nights we stayed in Luang Prabang, so this shows how much we liked walking around here! xD",December 2017,Luang Prabang Night Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295415-d1727836-Reviews-Luang_Prabang_Night_Market-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html,"Luang Prabang, Laos",attractions,4.0,4.0
Decent for a night's stay,My friend and I stayed here for one night during our transit in Bangkok. We chose to stay here because of its affordable price and that it provided free airport shuttle too.

Great Service from Hotel Staff,"My friend and I booked this hotel for our stay in Vientiane after reading all the good reviews about it. It did not disappoint! From the changing of their local sim card, to looking for money changer, asking for directions or the booking of taxi, the staff at the counter were always patient with us and were ready to lend a helping hand whenever we needed their help.

Oldest Temple in Vientiane,"When I visited this temple, I was initially shocked to see a lot of its Buddha statues being destroyed in one way or another.

Perfect Stay!,"My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights during our stay in Luang Prabang. Everything about this hotel was amazing! Shuttle service to and from town was available every half an hour from 9.10am onwards so it's really convenient every time we wanted to head to town. All we had to do was inform them in advance. Hotel staff were always there to lend a helping hand to us. We told them that our room was a little cold and minutes after, they sent in a heater to our room. We asked for directions and they would take out a map to explain to us in detail. Really appreciative of their excellent service! Food in their cafe was great as well.

A must-see if you're in Margaret River!,We visited this cave during our trip to Margaret River last week. It was around 300 plus steps down to the cave and the surrounding views were really nice. Felt a little scary as some stairs were kinda narrow and steep though. The view was even nicer once we entered the cave! All the lightings inside made the crystals look really pretty. Our guide also told us to spot interesting crystals which resembled certain animals or items. We learnt a lot during the guided tour. Do be warned that the way back up is 10 times more tiring than going down though.. At least for someone like myself who doesn't have stamina.. Haha.. But at least we got to rest in between where there are benches.. It's good to take pictures of the scenery on your way back up too.

Interesting horse riding experience along the bush tracks,"Since my friend and I were beginners, we initially wanted to book their scenic photo tour. However, since all the vacancies for our desired time slot were already taken, they recommended us to go for their country lane tour instead. The group of us took a ride out to the forests with instructors in front and behind us to help us along the way. I got a little scared when my horse started to trot a little in order to catch up with the other horses, but other than that, most of the ride was enjoyable.

Awesome breakfast and good service,We came here once for breakfast and ordered their roasted sweet potato and soaked oats as we wanted something a little different. Both did not disappoint! The sauteed vegetables that came together with the sweet potato were absolutely tasty. Poached eggs were delicious too! The oats went well with the fruits and nuts and was to our liking. Service was good as well.

Fish and chips was average,We had their fish and chips for dinner on our first day in Margaret River. Was kinda expecting it to be tasty but the fish only tasted average at its best. They gave huge portions of the chips though. Will try their squid if we were to visit again next time.,December 2016,Squidlips,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255367-d4574431-Reviews-Squidlips-Margaret_River_Margaret_River_Region_Western_Australia.html,"Margaret River, Australia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Great location and helpful staff,"My friend and I chose to stay in this hotel for our Perth trip because of the good reviews here. It did not disappoint! Firstly, the hotel staff were extremely helpful, whether it's the booking of taxi or asking for directions, you name it and they'll be there to help you. Special thanks to Linda who went the extra mile to assist us so as to ensure that our trip from Perth CBD to Margaret River was a smooth one. The location of the hotel was great too, right in the heart of Perth CBD, easily accessible to many tourist attractions like the Bell Tower, Kings Park and Perth Mint. Rooms wise, we stayed in their petite twin room and we had a bit of trouble opening our big luggages as the space was quite narrow. Other than the small space, everything else was ok, room was clean and had all the basic hotel amenities we required. Considering the price, I would say this hotel is really value for money! :)",December 2016,Pensione Hotel Perth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255103-d256469-Reviews-Pensione_Hotel_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html,"Perth, Australia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Educational trip to Botanic Garden,"The Kings Park & Botanic Garden is a nice place to visit, especially if you are visiting Perth for the first time. The view of the city from the park is really great, and we learnt a great deal about the plants and flowers there when we went for their free Botanic Garden guided tour. Free tours about the park's past and present are also available daily at 12pm. We definitely found our trip to this place a meaningful one!",December 2016,Kings Park and Botanic Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255103-d256589-Reviews-Kings_Park_and_Botanic_Garden-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html,"Perth, Australia",attractions,4.0,5.0
"Nice and cosy place, Delicious food","My friend and I had dinner in this restaurant once and we ordered their Tori Teppanyaki and Yaki-Niku to share. Both were delicious, in particular the Yaki-Niku. The tenderloin fillet was succulent and went well with my bowl of white rice. The waitress was prompt in filling our cups of tea too. It's a nice little restaurant to dine in if you're craving for Japanese food in Perth CBD! :)",December 2016,Yoshiya Japanese Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255103-d725533-Reviews-Yoshiya_Japanese_Restaurant-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html,"Perth, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Amazing tour around Perth,"Ji was our assigned chief explorer of the day and we had a great time touring the various places with him! Since our group consisted of a few kids, Ji made sure that the tour was catered to their needs and tried to make it as fun as possible. We had fun feeding and taking photos of the animals in Caversham Wildlife Park in the morning before heading to Homestead Brewery for a nice lunch. Thereafter, it was a 2 hour ride to the Pinnacles where we took many nice pictures. Ji was volunteered to help us take photos and even recommended us different angles where nice photos could be taken. Our ""Use Your Imagination!"" tour around the Pinnacles was a fun one as he told us to spot different animals based on the shapes of the various limestones there. We then headed to Lancelin Sand Dunes for sandboarding. Thank you Ji for bringing us on such an insightful tour around Perth!",December 2016,Explore Tours Perth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255103-d7264236-Reviews-Explore_Tours_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html,"Perth, Australia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Hands-on Bell Ringing was fun!,We paid 18 bucks for the entrance fee which included the ringing of the bells. Our guide gave us interesting facts of the bells and the tower. I found the bell ringing experience to be really fun! Couldn't quite understand how to make them ring at first but finally figured it out after much help from the guide. The view from the top of the tower was great too. The other levels in the tower also provided more information about the bells. Overall I would say this was an interesting visit. Be sure to try out the bell ringing if you were to visit this place!,December 2016,The Bell Tower,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255103-d267222-Reviews-The_Bell_Tower-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html,"Perth, Australia",attractions,4.0,4.0
Delicious food!,"We came here to try out their food after reading all the good reviews. We ordered their market fish and pork collar. Both were pretty looking and tasted really good! Ambience there was great too. Though their meals are kinda expensive, it's still worth it to try at least once!",December 2016,Petition,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255103-d8702393-Reviews-Petition-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html,"Perth, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
