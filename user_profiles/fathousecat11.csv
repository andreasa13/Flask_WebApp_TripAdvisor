Wonderful experience!,"Wonderful experience at the melt cafe. Had lunch here and was served by Kelly Grace and she was an absolute delight to deal with. Very patient and friendly with customers. The chefs were very accommodating too when I requested for customised lunch order for my son. Overall, an amazing experience.

Beautiful rooms with excellent service!,"My family and I stayed at Intercontinental Athenaeum during our visit to Athens. We had a wonderful stay! Even though the hotel is not the newest, the rooms are spacious and well-maintained. The friendly service was consistent everywhere, from the Reception to the Coffee House to the Housekeeping. I think customer service and the condition of the rooms are really important for a hotel and the Intercontinental doesn’t disappoint! A bonus is that they have a complimentary daily shuttle service to Syntagma Square. I will definitely stay there again the next time I come to Athens.",November 2019,InterContinental Athenaeum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d233052-Reviews-InterContinental_Athenaeum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
A must see when you are in Athens,"The Acropolis is the highlight of Athens! A must see when you are there. And the view, breathtaking! It is a bit of a walk to get to the place so for older folks or those with mobility issues, it may be a challenge. But the climb is really worth it, if you can make it.",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best driver ever!,"My family and I had the pleasure of meeting Nick when we took a cab from Athens airport. He is one of the best drivers we have ever met! Very friendly, sincere and knowledgeable. As it was our first time in Athens, he gave us a quick tour of the city along the way and even included some history of the country. We learned a lot from that short journey. We enjoyed our ride from the airport so much that we decided to book him again on our return trip. Call him when you are in Athens. I assure you that you won’t regret it!",November 2019,Nikos Taxi Service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12361580-Reviews-Nikos_Taxi_Service-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Not compassionate at all,"I initially booked 2 adult tickets and 1 infant ticket for a flight in Aug. Paid abt SGD500 extra for bassinet seats as well. Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away and I had to postpone my trip. I went to the office and paid extra to reissue the tickets. As I already paid for the bassinet seats (which I didn’t utilise), I appealed for them to accord me the same seats for my flight in Oct. The SG office asked me to submit a request to the head office. That’s when the whole issue started. Turkish Airlines has the worst feedback management system. Each time you submit a feedback, it goes to different agents and all of them do not seem to read the case details.

Anyway, I wrote to them and attached my grandmother’s death certificate. One agent asked me for proof that the one who passed away was really my grandmother (ridiculous). I gave the documents anyway, then another agent replied asking me to write in again after my flight. This is something I don’t understand because, why should I write in after my flight? So I wrote back to clarify. Then another agent said that they couldn’t help because my reason is not valid. What? Someone passed away and that reason is not valid? I wrote in multiple times after that, all with different agents replying and telling me that their process doesn’t allow transfers of paid seats. I subsequently asked for a refund since I didn’t use the seats so that I could purchase new bassinet seats for my new flights. Even that is not allowed.

Either the company is hard up for money or they just couldn’t be bothered to help the customer.

My issue is simple. I paid for seats but couldn’t fly because of an unfortunate reason. Why should I pay another SGD500 for new seats? Any compassionate company would help but not Turkish Airlines. One customer issue probably doesn’t matter to them.

If you don’t have issues, I guess it’ll be ok. But should anything crop up, don’t expect them to help. They simply couldn’t be bothered.",November 2019,Turkish Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729174-Reviews-Turkish-Airlines,World,flights,1.0,4.0
Definitely a dream come true,"My family and I stayed at the Foivos Suite for 3 nights and we loved every minute of it. The villa was very clean and spacious, with an amazing view from the Terrace. The location is excellent as Fira is just a short walk away. The breakfast was fantastic too! But the highlight of our stay was the personalised service we received from Dimitri and his team (Markos, Giannis and the Housekeeping lady). Everyone was wonderful and so sincere. Such a commitment to great customer service is to be commended. Next time you’re in Santorini, stay at Dreams! You won’t regret it.",November 2019,Dreams Luxury Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d667356-Reviews-Dreams_Luxury_Suites-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Poor reservations experience,"I was really excited to stay in Hotel Equarius for my husband’s birthday. However, the reservations experience made me think twice about confirming my stay. First, I requested for a deluxe room with a double bed as I will be travelling with a 7mths old baby who will not sleep in a cot. I was told that I will only know the type of bed I’ll get upon check-in. If they have a twin bed, I’ll have to take it. What? That’s certainly not fair as different customers require different bedding configurations. Secondly, I requested for a cake to celebrate my husband’s birthday. I have travelled to many hotels and this has never been a problem but in this hotel, I was told that they do not do such things. Even a small slice is not doable. If I want birthday “privileges”, I have to pay $8 to join some membership. That’s ridiculous. I’m a tourist so why should I join a membership? I just want to celebrate my husband’s birthday and be done with it. For the price they charge, the experience certainly does not match up.",January 2019,Resorts World Sentosa - Equarius Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294264-d1447343-Reviews-Resorts_World_Sentosa_Equarius_Hotel-Sentosa_Island.html,"Sentosa Island, Singapore",hotels,1.0,4.5
Simply Wonderful!,"I spent my birthday weekend at Montigo resorts and it was a superb stay experience. There are so many resorts in Batam (and I have stayed in quite a few a of them). The differentiating factor in Montigo is definitely the service! Everyone from the Guest Service staff (Ganjar, Vivi and their team) to the buggy drivers, to the restaurant staff (Neneng and team) were wonderful! I have to commend the management team, esp Raymond for their personalised and warm service. From my interaction with all of them, I can feel that they truly have the passion to serve and their sincerity is commendable.

We had the sea-view villa and it was beautiful. The sunset view is amazing. Even though our stay was a short one, we had a wonderful time. My family and I will be back for sure!

Thank you so much team Montigo! Keep up the great work!",April 2017,Montigo Resorts Nongsa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2543930-d2553808-Reviews-Montigo_Resorts_Nongsa-Nongsa_Batam_Riau_Archipelago_Riau_Islands_Province.html,"Batam, Indonesia",hotels,5.0,4.0
A truly relaxing experience!,"This is one of those places which offers great massage coupled with great service! The owner, Jeremiah, serves with sincerity and is extremely friendly. The masseuse who was assigned to me was amazing. Great massage skills and she is very committed to her job.

I visited Majesty Spa with my family and all of them only had wonderful things to say about this place! Even though the set-up of the room may be a little basic (I was in the couple room) as compared to other Spas in Batam, it is very clean and the service more than makes up for it.

Do visit this place and try it for yourself! Thank you Majesty Spa. I will be back.",April 2017,Majesty Spa & Massage Batam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2270770-d6894352-Reviews-Majesty_Spa_Massage_Batam-Nagoya_Batam_Riau_Archipelago_Riau_Islands_Province.html,"Batam, Indonesia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Simply amazing!,"After reading all the good reviews about the desert safari tour, we were convinced that we had to try it. That turned out to be one of the best decisions we made!

Our guide, Mr Rafeeq was great! He picked us up promptly and gave us an introduction of Dubai and the desert safari tour. He is a very skilled driver and he navigated through the desert very smoothly. As it was our first time in the desert, we took countless photographs and he patiently waited/assisted us with it. We did sandboarding and even got to catch beautiful pictures of the sunset.

Throughout the journey, Rafeeq made sure we felt comfortable. We had the best time and it wouldn't have been possible without Rafeeq! Two thumbs up! :D",May 2016,OceanAir Travels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d21174054-Reviews-OceanAir_Travels-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,5.0,5.0
Beautiful!,"We visited the Dubai Mall a couple of times while we were in Dubai. It's a huge mall with many shops and restaurants.

What's amazing about it is that it has a large aquarium (with sharks!) and a mini zoo within the mall. There are also interesting art pieces around the mall.

Definitely a must visit when you are in Dubai!",May 2016,The Dubai Mall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d1210327-Reviews-The_Dubai_Mall-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,5.0,4.5
Not a bad experience,"I visited SPA Secret in Jan 2015. Tried their 2.5 hr herbal spa and the hair spa. The herbal spa was an amazing experience. The masseuse was skilled and made me feel very relaxed.

However, the hair spa was horrible. Felt that the therapist did not know what she was doing. My hair is short and normally, you would only need a small amount of shampoo to wash it. However, the therapist used A LOT (8 pumps) of shampoo and that caused my hair to feel really 'squeaky' clean and dry. Also, she kept on burping THROUGHOUT the session. Even though she apologised, i felt that it was just gross and very distracting. The massage was not that great either. That would probably be my last Hair Spa at SPA Secret.",January 2015,The Spa Secret,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297717-d2510514-Reviews-The_Spa_Secret-Batam_Riau_Archipelago_Riau_Islands_Province.html,"Batam, Indonesia",attractions,3.0,4.5
Nothing Special,"Dated property. Everything is expensive and for the quality, it's not worth the money. Don't bother with the KTV room. The sound system is bad and the system is just... bad.

A wonderful experience,"My partner and I had a wonderful experience at the Mercure. The swimming pool, though a tad small, had a gorgeous view of Kuta Beach. That was definitely a plus for me. The rooms were pretty small but there were only 2 of us so it was sufficient.

The hotel is located just beside the Hard Rock hotel. It is also just across the road from Kuta beach and probably less than 10 mins walk to Kuta square. Very accessible as you are kind of in the middle of Kuta. The staff were really friendly as well. I would definitely stay there again during my next trip.",January 2012,Mercure Kuta Bali,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297697-d299592-Reviews-Mercure_Kuta_Bali-Kuta_Kuta_District_Bali.html,"Kuta, Indonesia",hotels,4.0,3.5
A Big Disappointment,"I booked a villa at the Chateau for my partners birthday. The staff kindly upgraded us to the 3 bedroom villa. Unfortunately, that was the start of my nightmare. The room was huge but we did not have a proper nights sleep as there was a hole in the roof. It rained at night and the whole bed was wet. We would have called for help but the phone lines and WIFI were both down. So there we were, stranded in a huge villa with no means of getting in touch with anyone.

Before we knew that there was a hole in the roof, we tried to get a metered cab down to Jimbaran for dinner but we were forced to pay an exorbitant amount of money for the ride. As the place was secluded, we had no choice but to go for it. There was no use complaining to the staff as they got quite defensive. If you are looking for a nice villa getaway, i wouldn't recommend staying here.",January 2012,Chateau de Bali Ungasan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1219108-d1568626-Reviews-Chateau_de_Bali_Ungasan-Ungasan_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html,"Ungasan, Indonesia",hotels,1.0,2.5
