Enveloped with history,"Completed around the mid-1700s the original house was the Summer Residence of the British Viceroy. In Classical style with pediment and Ionic columns it presents a dignified presence.

In the period after the 1937 Constitution which established the Office of President there were plans to construct a new Aras in the Phoenix Park. But the World War intervened and it subsequently became the Official residence.

A much admired edifice visible from Chesterfield Avenue, it has hosted and welcomed many dignitaries over the decades.

Prior to 1990 and the election of the first woman President, Mary Robinson, the image of the incumbents was somewhat remote from everyday life of the citizens. It has changed significantly during the intervening three decades.",April 2021,Aras an Uachtarain (The Irish White House),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d215064-Reviews-Aras_an_Uachtarain_The_Irish_White_House-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Designed by celebrated architect,"One of the most striking features is a dramatic lantern extending the full length of the apex. Inside, this light filled enclosure is additionally wonderful to admire.

Designed by the applauded architect John Meagher it was consecrated in 1982. It makes for a marvellous profile when viewed from any number of stances, including through the leafing branches.

A harmony of brick, tile and glass, the facades are a testament to modernity in architecture. Moving inside is to see an intimate space of concentric arrays of seating beneath a pitched ceiling of warm wood.

With an altar area of lovely simplicity complemented by statuary in alcoves on either side, it is a thoughtful and contemplative room.

A grand freestanding bell tower was unveiled in 2006. With a century year old bell donated by a Connemara Convent atop and a cross further beneath, it is completed with attractive art work.

This is the creation of Cecilia Moore and comprises two vibrant mosaics of coloured glass inlaid with bronzes.

A small garden of remembrance dedicated to local youth is a further appealing attribute.",April 2021,Church Of The Immaculate Heart Of Mary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g580196-d23321282-Reviews-Church_Of_The_Immaculate_Heart_Of_Mary-Clondalkin_County_Dublin.html,"Clondalkin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,5.0
Grandeur from Belle Epoque era,"Being the richest family in Ireland at the time, it was only a Guinness that would conceive of this magnificent mansion, almost immediately after purchasing a family mansion directly across the road.

A five bay edifice in Tudor Revival style it was completed for the young Arthur Ernest Guinness in the early 1900s. A place for excitement, entertainment and hosting society parties; in contrast to his recently acquired family home across the way that was for more prosaic pursuits such as sleeping.

A grand oak panelled entrance hall with parquet floor lead onto a sweeping wood carved staircase. Stained glass adornment was plentiful. Numerous decorated reception rooms greeted guests.

It was festooned with all contemporary aspects of Edwardian modernity. A large tiled indoor swimming pool was to be enjoyed; a rarity in those days.

Red chimney pots in barley twist style can be seen emerging over the wall on Tower Road. Another landmark feature is the enclosed footbridge over Knockmaroon Hill that links both mansions.

It was a playground for his three young daughters who in time would become known as the Golden Guinness Girls. One later remarked that it was always exciting going back to the house, never knowing what latest addition would greet them.

A new chapter began in 1949 on the death of Ernest when the houses passed to the Irish State as part of death duties. Shortly thereafter the State donated the properties to a religious congregation for use as a school and home.

Some years ago the properties were vacated and that remains the case. It is fascinating to contemplate what the next phase holds for this splendid edifice.",October 2020,Glenmaroon House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551505-d23255339-Reviews-Glenmaroon_House-Castleknock_County_Dublin.html,"Castleknock, Ireland",attractions,5.0,5.0
Ornate landmark,"A gorgeous sight on the skyline, this ornate edifice had three purposes when completed in the 1880s.

An aesthetically attractive tower of nearly 60 metres, an outstanding landmark, it told the time to local citizens.

But its main practical role was as a voluminous water reservoir. Containing an enormous tank of more than 8000 litres, it supplied water to Farmleigh Estate.

This was the home of Edward Cecil Guinness, a great-grandson of the famous brewery’s founder Arthur Guinness, and future first Lord Iveagh.

Additionally the endeavour provided electricity for the House, only the second house in Ireland with electric lighting, after its neighbour across the Park, the Vice Regal Lodge, now Áras an Uachtaráin the President’s Residence.

With construction materials of limestone and marble, fabulous vistas were to be had from the viewing balcony, enhanced by a telescope installed by Guinness.

On the east and west sides clock faces were installed, whose mechanism was designed by Sir Howard Grubb. He was most famous for designing intricate instruments and specifically astronomical telescopes.

This is thought to be the only clock by him. Interestingly the clock faces are at different heights, possibly reflecting disparate times for completions of tower and clock. A large container of sand is at the bottom of the stairs to protect the pendulum and weights in case of an accidental fall.

Until the early 2000s the clock was wound manually every day. At this juncture the mechanism was electrified.

Five clock bells on the top floor were to be heard chiming on the quarter hour. The hour bell was cast in Louvain, Belgium. The bells no longer chime.",October 2020,The Clock Tower At Farmleigh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551505-d23232160-Reviews-The_Clock_Tower_At_Farmleigh-Castleknock_County_Dublin.html,"Castleknock, Ireland",attractions,5.0,5.0
Fascinating life of a mid-1800s Mansion,"It began around the mid-1800s when the successful retailing entrepreneur Gilbert Burns decided to build a splendid family home in the countryside to the west of Dublin city, adjacent to the Phoenix Park.

A scenic site overlooking the River Liffey, the grounds sloped all the way to the river’s banks. Terraced gardens were beautifully laid out in the Italianate style providing gorgeous vistas. One access to it was via a horse and carriage bridge spanning the road.

In 1903 a new chapter began when the mansion was purchased by Arthur Ernest Guinness of the famous brewing empire. Recently married and with the first of three daughters born the following year, he progressed thorough the family business. It is said that he walked every day to the brewery at St James’s Gate.

One mansion not being sufficient, he soon decided to build another even more grand one across the road. They were connected by footbridge, a later version of which still spans Tower Road.

On his death in 1949 the estate passed to the Irish State as part of death duties. Some years later the properties were given to a Religious Order and were used as a school and later as a care home.

In the 2000s the Order relinquished the houses. They remain vacant.",October 2020,Knockmaroon Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551505-d23215467-Reviews-Knockmaroon_Lodge-Castleknock_County_Dublin.html,"Castleknock, Ireland",attractions,5.0,5.0
Fine collection of Greek Art from recent times,"Striking works by Theofrastos Triantafyllidis were absorbing to admire, including Easter Procession from around 1939 and Last Rehearsal.

Set in an impressive former factory that was designed by the famous Danish architect Christian Hansen, it has been the gallery’s new home since 2010.

A child walking in an expansive landscape by the sea is the subject of Periklis Lytras's Returning. By contrast are the swirling ghostly figures in Melancholic Outbreak by Celeste Polychroniadi. Another by the same artist is Young Lady.

Yorgos Bouzianis was a renowned expressionist who represented Greece at the 1950 Venice Biennale. We saw two of his creations here - Woman in the Mirror and Two Women.

The Lady with a White Glove by Mimis Vitsoris is an elegant portrait. Daughter in the Window by Aglaia Papa and The Model and His Reflection created by Periklis Vyzantios are thought provoking.",March 2020,Municipal Art Gallery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2307236-Reviews-Municipal_Art_Gallery-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Seemingly intended as a funerary monument,"Almost passed this by unnoticed, what with the verdant backdrop.

It’s a lovely depiction and was created in the early 1950s by the accomplished artist Nikos Perantinos.

It shows a young woman on one knee with flowers being offered from her right hand.

Apparently it was intended as a funerary statue, hence the title of Memory and the presence of flowers.

It has resided here since 1989.",March 2020,Memory Sculpture By Nikos Perantinos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d23101014-Reviews-Memory_Sculpture_By_Nikos_Perantinos-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Superb reflection of its centrality in civic life of the city during ancient times,"We thoroughly enjoyed over two hours strolling throughout this superb area admiring the evocative remains of what was the centre of daily civic life in antiquity.

It was fascinating to learn that it was in use for millennia before becoming the Civic Centre of the City, including as a cemetery during the latter Bronze Age. But undoubtedly it’s as the former that is best reflected in the great remnants and restorations.

A gorgeous intricate Corinthian Capital is to be seen, as is a fine statue of Emperor Hadrian, who foremost of the Romans contributed most to Athens. Only the torso survives but it exquisitely shows a wolf suckling the twins Romulus and Remus of Roman legend and the Goddess Athena standing atop the wolf.

A number of Stoa are displayed - South Stoa I, possibly used by metronomoi who were officials in charge of weights and measures; Middle Stoa that dates from around 180 BCE; and the undoubted jewel that is the Stoa of Attalos.

Wonderfully restored in the 1950s it hosts the interesting Agora Museum with artefacts including fascinating Ostraca that were used to vote to banish or ostracise citizens.

A lovely Byzantine Church of Agios Apostoloi with grand stone craft is well worth perusing. It is one of only two original edifices in the complex.

The second is the gorgeous stunning Temple of Hephaestus, completed in 415 BCE and one of the highlights. A vista of Pentelic marble columns against the saturated early morning blue was delightful. Regarded as one of the best preserved Greek temples from antiquity it is a marvellous treasure.

A Dais that bore ten bronze sculptures representing the Tribes of Athens is still evocative after more than two millennia. It is known as the Monument of the Eponymous Heroes

Vestiges of Altars and Temples to numerous Deities are extant, including to Ares the Olympian Deity who was God of the Spirit of Battle. Further Altars are to Zeus and Zeus Agoraios, a most powerful God.

Impressive and ornate with arrays of Corinthian columns, the grand Odeon of Agrippa was a gift to the Athenians from Emperor Augustus’s Son-in-Law. Impressive sculptures line the outlines and the fine performance space could accommodate an audience of around 1000.

A water mill residue comprising two large circular mill stones is a further fascinating picture of ancient life, as is the Great Drain that provided essential drainage preventing flooding in the Agora.",March 2020,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

These were pieces of usually broken pottery that were used by citizens to write the name of a person that was to be banished, or ostracised, from the city for ten years.

Daily civic life of the Athenians in antiquity is reflected in the displays. Included are official weights, a piece of an allotment machine and tags belonging to officials.

More of a market area than for political pursuits,"Passing by the marvellous monumental Gate of Athena Archegetis that was established by contributions from both Augustus and Julius Caesar is to view the impressive expanse of the site.

Completed in the last decades BC it served as a market place, in contrast to the Ancient Agora that was a place of political undertakings.

Much is well extant including the Agoranomeion that dates from the mid-1st century CE. It is speculated that it may have served as a Basilica for the worship of Emperors.

Not far away are the remains of a Basilica, a substantial public building from Hadrian’s reign. It had many functions including the holding of court hearings.

A most remarkable edifice is the beautiful Tower of the Winds. Creatively built as a weather vane and water clock, it has fabulous friezes of the eight winds on each octagonal side depicting the eight winds of Greek mythology.

These include Apeliotes bearing fruit and grain, Euros Bearded male with a cloak billowing in the wind and Boreas blowing the cold north wind through a large conch shell.

Glorious of an early morning,"Setting out at sunrise along Athinas past Monastiraki and taken with the ever approaching vista on high, we arrived before the 8am opening.

A gorgeous sunny morning in low season made it a perfect time for visiting, having it practically to ourselves.

Entering through the magnificent soaring Propylaia we admired the gorgeous Temple of Athena Nike, constructed in the 420s BCE to celebrate Athenian victories over the Persians.

Even though the Erechtheion Caryatids are replicas, it is a great sight infused with myth and mystery. Later we saw the graceful originals in the brilliant Acropolis Museum.

A Statue of Athena Promachos was a striking monument in antiquity. It honoured the Protectress in gratitude for victories in the Persian Wars and stood about 9 metres high.

What can be seen today of the Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia comprises elements of foundations and walls. It is likely that the Cult of Artemis commenced on the Acropolis in the 6th century BCE.

Walking around the Parthenon was marvellous yielding many fabulous views of the stunning Temple. The Pentelic marble changed appearance as the morning light progressed. It was easy picking out the modern segments in the columns, all part of preservation and renovation that has been underway for decades.

On the way to the Theatre of Dionysus we first gazed at the wonderful Herod Atticus Odeon, where many famous artists have performed, including Maria Callas in 1957.

Moving to the fabulous Central Building in late 1841, this is the central edifice of the trio of magnificent constructs in Neo-Classical designed by Christian Hansen the Danish architect.

Empress with Maidservants in Red Coral and diaphanous delicate figurines are just some to be savoured.

The elevation of Christianity and its extensive Byzantine era are engrossing. It is plain once again how new movements always absorb aspects of what is superseded.

A Theodosian Pilaster Capital in marble decorated in overlapping acanthus leaves from 5th century Thessaloniki is magnificent.

Fabulous lengthy parchment scroll from late 13th early 14th century are fabulous, the colour and detail reflecting such devotion to God.

A highlight is the serene icons, particularly those of the Virgin Mary. A number showed the Hodegetria holding the Jesus as a child and pointing to him as the wellspring of salvation for humankind. The child in turn raises his hand in blessing.

Wonderful Frissiras Museum has an outstanding collection of art. An engaging temporary exhibition was underway, in addition to superb permanent works such as At the Bar and My Mother with the Silent Telephone.

Not far from the former is the outstanding historic Monument of Lysikrates. Dating from the mid 330s BCE and built by the wealthy Athenian Lysicrates, a Choregos who financed music and dramas in the ancient theatre.

It was marvellous seeing originals of five of the Caryatids, the sixth still residing in the British Museum.

Undoubtedly the highlight was the top floor with its Parthenon Gallery. Before enjoying the displays we viewed the excellent 15 minute audiovisual, which is highly recommended.

Metopes and frieze are superbly exhibited around the outside of the hall as they appeared on the Parthenon. So many sculptures are to be enjoyed, outlining the Panathenaic Procession and the Pediments’ contents.

Undoubtedly the grandest is their Sunday morning apparel for this ceremony, the kilt-like Foustanella that feature 400 pleats, one for each year of Ottoman occupation.

It’s a great enjoyable sight seeing them march and stride.

Other symbols of their uniform include the red cap calling to mind blood shed during the long arduous struggle for Independence and the black tassels signifying tears cried under Occupation.

Stone Age to Modern,"We thought the adjacent Tree Of Peace Sculpture an apt countermeasure to all that’s recorded and documented in the museum.

With a sweep from stone age to modern it is a fabulously comprehensive account of warfare and battle down the ages.

A number of stone weapons are shown and while rudimentary they undoubtedly yielded a heavy blow. Triremes, ancient warships, that were instrumental in guarding and defending the Athenian empire are well worth seeing.

The Greek struggle for independence from the Ottomans features voluminously. Horrors endures are powerfully conveyed in paintings such as Hunger in Athens by Nicholas Egon.

Sculptural representations from this war include the heroic Markos Botsaris, amongst others.

Liberation Celebrations from WW II occupying forces are depicted in evocative black and white photos. A Statue of Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz shows the Greek-Polish athlete who fought in the Greek resistance and was executed by the Germans.",February 2020,War Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d498309-Reviews-War_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great avenue from Omonia to Ermou,"Our apartment was close to this fine route, so we traversed along it many times enjoying the sights and sounds.

A gorgeous little Church that of Agia Kyriaki caught our eye on our first stroll. Built while the Ottomans were occupying it has an attractive façade with impressive stone craft and a belfry with clock.

Within is a lovely Iconostasis. A fine sculpture of an eagle with fully outstretched wings symbolises carrying the Word around the world.

At the start at Omonia we admired the impressive Pentakiklon Sculpture. Unveiled in 2001 we assume it marked the Olympics, announced for Athens in 1997 and hosted there in 2004.

Before coming to the imposing Town Hall, the fine sculpture of Pericles is to be seen. Created in gleaming Carrara marble by the German artist Heinrich Faltermeier it was revealed in 1973.

Seen from delightful Kotzia Square the Neo-Classical Town Hall is elegant. Built in the 1870s with just two floors because finance wasn’t plentiful, it was expanded with the addition of a third one in 1937.

On Kotzia itself the most striking feature is a marvellous modern sculptural depiction of the Greek mythical hero Theseus. Surrounded by a great fountain, it was completed in 1996.

As Central Markets go the one here is truly expansive and comprehensive. We ambled around both the offerings of fish multitudes and the adjoining meat and vegetable arrays. Immense indeed.",February 2020,Athens Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d793255-Reviews-Athens_Street-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.0
Singular attraction,"On a gorgeous sunny blue sky Sunday afternoon we took a grand stroll to the pinnacle. While the scenes on the way were good, those to be enjoyed from the summit were incomparable.

Walking around, fabulous vistas of the white city below, stretching to mountains are to be marvelled at.

A lovely Chapel, that of St. George, is worth dropping into. A grand frescoed dome, impressive iconostasis and images of St. George are some of the tranquil highlights.

We stopped off for refreshments at the lovely placed café which was busy with weekend visitors.

Another treat was taking the funicular down. While a short descent it was lovely seeing the city fast approaching.",March 2020,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Estimable place of repose, having opened in 1837","Through the imposing modern entrance we strolled around for about an hour, admiring the wonderful monuments to the departed.

That of Heinrich Schliemann, one of the most famous ever archaeologists, is aptly in the form of a Greek Temple.

We recognised many of the names with thoughtful memorials dedicated. Melina Mercouri's reflects the adoration she remains held in by her country.

George Averoff, renowned philanthropist and businessman, has one of the most impressive dedications. Portrayed seated atop a multi-level creation in marble, it is a superb monument to such a life.

Three Churches are here. At the entrance is the one of Saint Theodore, the largest. Greek Orthodox, it has a lovely façade in pale light azure hues.",March 2020,First Cemetery of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d8426708-Reviews-First_Cemetery_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Delightful dining with lovely ambiance,"Arriving back after a great daytrip to Delphi we had here in mind for a celebratory dinner. And we weren’t disappointed.

Having a variation of moussaka and pasta with Greek bottarga, joined with a dry white wine, totally delicious.

Not bypassing dessert when invited, plus coffee and cappuccino, brought the fine fare to a close. Staff throughout were great, welcoming, cheerful and helpful.

A grand décor enhanced the overall experience. We have no hesitation in awarding a high recommendation.",February 2020,Vintage Wine Bar & Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6981501-Reviews-Vintage_Wine_Bar_Bistro-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Best views in town amidst the grandeur,"We very much enjoyed our visit to such opulence. Moving by the fine foyer with its luxury and numerous art pieces, we made for the 7th floor and the grand Tudor Hall terrace.

Arriving as sun descended below the horizon we were treated to stunning vistas of the Acropolis. I think some of the best we had seen in the city.

A warm welcome by the gracious staff set the scene for a memorable occasion. We began with a couple of cocktails, relaxing and soaking up the wonderful surrounds.

Dinner was delicious, having chosen from the imaginative menu of choices. With a chilled local white wine, followed by sweet offerings and coffee, all delightful.",February 2020,"King George, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Athens",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d276262-Reviews-King_George_a_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Lovely Church with venerable timespan,"During our first walk-about in the great city, this evocative church was the initial one of many subsequently we enjoyed visiting.

Around it being a favourite gathering place for locals and visitors, it harks back to the 10th century and is a grand legacy of the Byzantine.

It was the church of the Monastery after which the area is named. Grand stone work is a hallmark.

It’s popular not only with people, with many of our feathered friends gathering and perching on the tiled roof.",February 2020,Church of St. Mary Pantanassa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d10796140-Reviews-Church_of_St_Mary_Pantanassa-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Wends its way for a marvellous stroll through ancient and modern,"A fabulous parade through the essence of the city, we meandered along it on many days. Beginning at the Ancient Agora, passing through Monastiraki Square and away to Plaka, intersecting Kidathineon here.

As now, it was in the ancient city the oldest commercial street. Bustling with shops with almost every conceivable item, it’s a lively vibrant thoroughfare.

Eateries abound throughout. Especially opposite the Ancient Agora, and we enjoyed much good fare from breakfast to dinner.

Many outstanding attractions are to be enjoyed, beginning with the Ancient Agora that we arrived at just as it opened and had practically to ourselves.

Monastiraki Square is wonderful and nearby is Hadrian’s Library and Roman Agora, both fascinating.

Continuing onto Plaka, we took time at The Benizelos Mansion that has the distinction of being the oldest house in Athens.",March 2020,Adrianou Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198762-Reviews-Adrianou_Street-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Quiet moments,"Passing by the marvellous Runner sculpture and before proceeding to the museum bounty, we lingered here for a while.

Sylvan pathways surrounded by grand flora made for a pleasant stop-off. Triangular in outline it is wedged between two busy main thoroughfares.

Interesting to learn that originally it comprised the grounds of a Seminary, but today it provides a popular green space for all.",February 2020,Parko Rizari,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d16726004-Reviews-Parko_Rizari-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
