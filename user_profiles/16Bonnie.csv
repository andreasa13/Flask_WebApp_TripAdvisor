Wonderful B&B!,"Our stay at the Rio Grande B&B far exceeded my expectations. Our room was upstairs and was very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was beautiful and even had heated floors. We had a spacious sitting room which was great to relax at the end of the evening. The hosts provided many comforts to make our stay enjoyable including freshly baked cookies, a container of bleach wipes (during Covid this was especially important!), a tote bag of beach towels for the Glenwood Hot Springs, and more. The breakfast was absolutely incredible! The quality and quantity was exceptional. The orange creme brûlée was my favorite! It is also conveniently located, and it is easy to walk into town or to the hot springs. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Glenwood! I highly recommend staying here!",July 2020,Rio Grande Bed and Breakfast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33446-d12454050-Reviews-Rio_Grande_Bed_and_Breakfast-Glenwood_Springs_Colorado.html,"Glenwood Springs, Colorado",hotels,5.0,5.0
"Hidden Gem, Peaceful Place!","Our stay at the Double G Guestranch was outstanding! Our hosts, Frank and Sandra, were gracious, accommodating, friendly, and helpful. From the minute we arrived we were treated wonderfully. Our room, the ""Eagle's Nest"" was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The 360 views were stunning. We ate dinner at the resort, and Sandra prepared a delicious homemade meal. Breakfast was also wonderful. Although a small and remote property, it is beautiful--horses, views, privacy!

"Excellent service, great pizza!","We were in Vincennes for Thanksgiving week and ate at Renine Thanksgiving night. We were all tired after a day at Versailles, but were able to make a reservation here based on great reviews. When we got there, the server did not speak much English, and my French is barely passable. However, she was amazingly patient with me, and together, we were able to order for all of us (we were a party of six plus two babies). Her attitude, service, and help was incredible (I wish I knew/remembered her name to give her the credit!. The pizzas were delicious (although not our typical Thanksgiving meal in France!), and we had a wonderful experience. I can't wait to go back here when in Vincennes again.

"Lots of potential, charming Bayeux","Hotel Chateau De Bellefontaine has incredible potential. We took our family there and booked three rooms (our daughters and their families have babies). We had three separate rooms, and we were surprised how differently appointed they all were! My husband's and my room was quite spacious, and the bathroom was huge. It did not have a shower, just a shower handle in a tub. The grounds are beautiful, and they provide an extensive breakfast (although not inexpensive). It is in a great location, and in summer would be amazing. We were there at a chilly time of year. The hotel is a little tired and could use some maintenance, but we did enjoy our stay here. I would go back for sure, but I would prefer the summer so I could spend time on their magnificent grounds.",November 2019,Hôtel Château De Bellefontaine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187181-d243839-Reviews-Hotel_Chateau_De_Bellefontaine-Bayeux_Calvados_Basse_Normandie_Normandy.html,"Bayeux, France",hotels,4.0,4.0
Amazing Parisian Suburb--surpassed expectations!,"We stayed here for Thanksgiving week with our whole family--daughters, sons-in-laws, and grandbabies. We were so pleasantly surprised with how much space the condo had! We had a three-bedroom, and we had more than enough room for six adults and two babies (with two cribs and high chairs, and a baby bath--provided by the resort). The kitchen was adequately accommodated and fit all of us. The living/family room was quite spacious, too. Vincennes was a quaint little town with all you could need. The metro ride into Paris was easy as well. The front desk staff varied (some knew every way to help us, and others did not have much knowledge). I ordered breakfast items to be in the room prior to our visit, and that was not done correctly, but the staff quickly handled it, and by the morning, we had what we ordered. Fresh croissants, coffee, baguettes, and more. The only real negative was the wifi was not good at all. We tried to talk to the front desk about this, but they were completely unable to fix it for us. I will definitely stay here again (especially with a larger group).

Our favorite restaurant at Denver International Airport,"We eat here before almost every trip out of DIA, and we are never disappointed. Although a bit pricey, we enjoy every meal here. We find it to provide good service, great food, and a relaxing atmosphere. We like the set up (great baggage storage!), the menu (I can get a good gluten free meal), the drinks, and the overall feel.

Not a bad choice at DIA,"We typically eat somewhere else when at DIA, but we were traveling with our daughter, son-in-law, and 2 month old grandson, so we picked the easiest, and what we thought would be the fasted, location. While the food was good, the service was extremely slow. Our server was pleasant enough, but it seemed challenging to get orders in on time. We ordered to-go meals as well as we were traveling internationally, so maybe that was part of the slow down.

Delicious BBQ,Shorty's is part of my past--I grew up going here for as long as I can remember (even to the original location that burned down). The bbq pork platter is delicious--go hungry for sure!

I had to send my glass of wine back as it was filled with cork (I do know this happens, but it was part of the experience we faced that night). I ordered the Greek fries (they are supposed to come with truffle oil and feta) and got regular fries and they had to redo them. Then I ordered the ahi tacos and was give lamb and beef tacos instead which I also had to send back. My husband loved the pork chop, and the lobster bisque was quite tasty.

It wasn't a problem for us, but if you have a lot of luggage, it could be a challenge. The staff was kind and welcoming, but we did not have many interactions with them.

It is in a nice, quiet area yet it was easy to get around (I recommend having a car even though the staff was wonderful about driving you to close by places for free). Our room was a bit different as the bed is upstairs in the loft and was only accessible by ladder. We overlooked the sea and the caldera, and we loved the gorgeous views! The pool is a highlight (even though the water was chilly). It overlooks the caldera and is very nice. The included breakfast was good and offered both hot and cold options.

When we arrived, Panos provided us with a detailed overview of the island and the hotel. We were taken to two rooms and asked to select the room we wanted which was a nice touch. The room was modern and good-sized, and we overlooked the pool with a nice little patio. We ate lunch at the hotel the first day, and it was quite good. We enjoyed the outdoor patio in the evenings to relax and have a glass of wine. Breakfast was an excellent buffet with many good options. Panos even made me a wonderful cup of decaf coffee and brought it to me as soon as we came in for breakfast each morning. We walked or rode a rented scooter into town most of the time, but the staff willingly dropped us off in town as well, which was great. The walk into the old town is quite nice, the uphill climb on the way back isn’t as fun. I would recommend taking a taxi back, especially if it is late.

Caring Crew!,"The crew on my flight was incredible! I was in the middle of driving from Florida to Colorado with one daughter when my other daughter in Colorado found out she was going to deliver her baby early! I needed to get home! We were close to Atlanta, so I managed to book a last minute flight home. The staff member at the counter was very helpful with my booking, and she helped to try to get me out of Atlanta ASAP. When I got to the gate, the pilot/captain was there. I jokingly asked him to get to Denver as fast as he could. He came back to me a little while later, told me he had made arrangements for me to join the preboarding group so I could sit up front and get off the plane as quickly as I could. He did everything he could to help me out. Obviously, he could only fly the way he was supposed to--safely!, but he went out of his way to calm me down and help me out. The flight attendants were also very kind and gracious. The entire Southwest staff was very amazing, caring, and helpful. We fly Southwest a lot, but this trip confirms to me why we keep using them!

"Wonderful Winery, great wines!","We enjoyed our wine tasting visit at Madrigal. My brother (who is a sommelier) recommended it, and we were very pleased.

Arles Amphitheater views!,"Hotel Spa Le Calendal was very pleasant. We were only there one night, but the room was spacious and clean. The staff was very kind and arranged dinner reservations for us.

Tapas in Arles,"Our hotel recommended Bodguita and made us a reservation. The tapas were quite good as was the wine (we got a bottle of wine to bring back to our hotel).

Amazing accommodations! 5 stars not high enough!,"I cannot say enough about Aurelia B&B or the fantastic hosts there! We stayed there last week, and we were so impressed in every way. If ever in Mostar, I would never stay anywhere else. We were in Bosnia with another couple, and we felt completely at home at Aurelia.The hosts were friendly, caring, helpful, and attentive. Communication before we arrived was excellent (Džan even drove into town to escort us in as the nearby road was under construction).

The location to old town Mostar is very convenient, just a short walk. The breakfast was amazing--and so much food! Emina is an excellent cook and made a variety of delicious foods for us. Džan and Emina were so informative about Mostar and their personal stories of living their lives in Bosnia. Rooms are spacious, nicely appointed, and very clean. They truly care about their home, gardens, and guests.

"Nice experience in Nice, fantastic host!","We weren't sure where to eat in Nimes, and we were there a little late for a traditional lunch. We chose Au P'tit Nimes as it looked to be the best in the square. The menu is extensive, the food was ""okay."" However, I do want to rave about the service and the courteous staff. We were treated wonderfully, with good humor, and efficiency. Another table actually complained about slow service which shocked us. We thought the service to be excellent. We talked to the owner quite a bit, exchanged English and French phrases, and enjoyed our experience here (we were the last customers there before they closed, but they didn't rush us out at all). Although the food wasn't the best we we had on our trip, the experience was very pleasant.

New in Midtown,"The Embassy Suites Midtown is a conveniently located, clean, new hotel. We were able to easily walk to Times Square and many other locations. The room was very clean and comfortable, but small (although that seems typical in NYC). The sitting area is quite small and not easily usable for more than one person. The bed was comfortable, and the blackout curtains helped us sleep in and relax. The breakfast offered lots of choices including an omelet station. The staff were all friendly, but the bar staff was especially so. The only complaint I have was that the elevator was extremely slow. Good choice--I highly recommend it.",March 2018,Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d11998087-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_by_Hilton_New_York_Manhattan_Times_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,4.0,4.0
Amazing Amphitheatre,"We truly enjoyed visiting the best preserved Roman arena. Arenes de Nimes dates from about A.D. 100. This site highlights the perfection in early Roman architecture. The design and construction are both incredible. This site provides an excellent audioguide (so much information!), and great ""re-enactment"" audio files. Don't pay for the extra tablet tour--the audioguide is plenty. There are very informative panels throughout the arena that work very well with the audioguide (panels are in both French and English). Take your time and go to the very top--great views of the city, but also of the arena itself. It provides a great perspective, the same the early Romans had of this great arena. I liked being able to actually get out onto the actual arena floor--incredible.",March 2018,Arenes de Nimes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187154-d243551-Reviews-Arenes_de_Nimes-Nimes_Gard_Occitanie.html,"Nimes, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Ancient Aqueduct,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Pont du Gard. There is an informative museum prior to visiting the bridge which was quite good. It explains how the bridge was built and how it influenced the town of Nimes. This is a wonderfully preserved Roman bridge which was part of a 30 mile aqueduct, and it is very impressive.

"Quiet, lovely Villa Victoria","This quaint hotel is in the heart of Nice. It is quite close to both the Promenade des Anglais and Vieux Nice, or Old Nice (Old Town). Both are in easy walking distance. Villa Victoria has a lovely garden area in back. It was chilly when we visited, but I can just imagine sitting out there sipping coffee or a glass of wine--very beautiful. The staff at the hotel were all very efficient and friendly. I emailed with them several times prior to our stay and I always received helpful and prompt replies. We had a nice little balcony with city views. The breakfast had many different options. I would highly recommend staying here.

Vieux Nice,"I absolutely loved the Old Town in Nice! I honestly wasn't as excited about visiting Nice as I was about some other places on our trip, but was very pleasantly surprised. We actually even went there a couple of times during our visit to the Riviera.

Pre-Theater Italian Dinner,"We met my sister and her husband at Osteria al Doge before seeing Aladdin in Times Square. It is very conveniently located to the theater district, just an easy walk over. We enjoyed our dinners, mainly very traditional entrees. It is a very busy place, so I recommend making reservations (especially if you are heading to the theater afterwards). I had the filetto di maiale which is a roasted pork loin with a delicious rosemary sauce.

"Beautiful vineyard, nice wines","We were very excited about visiting Duckhorn vineyards. We have enjoyed their wines over the years, and were looking forward to trying some of their other options. The vineyard is in a beautiful setting. The building has a gorgeous wrap-around porch and is lovely. Our sommelier was very attentive and knowledgeable. We enjoyed our wine tasting with a delicious charcuterie plate. A couple of wines we tried included a 2014 Gowan Creek Pinor Noir, a 2014 Carneros Merlot, a 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Patzimaro Vineyard), and a 2013 from Napa called the Discussion.

"Lovely Le Cave, Marvelous Mougins","Wonderful place to have a glass (or two!) of wine and great light food. I had the omelette which was delicious, but the side salad with it was beyond incredible! So many flavors and options. (I am super picky, but the combination in this salad was one I hope to recreate--delicious!) Grapes, pine nuts, green onion, carrot, walnut, tomato, golden raisins, jicama, dried fruit, bamboo shoots, radish, peas... absolutely wonderful! We loved the wine selections. The ""cave"" has great wine selections. We especially loved the La Gigondas wines. The staff was very accommodating, and we enjoyed our time to tour the cave. It is small, but they have excellent selections. The views are magnificent, and this was the perfect place to celebrate being in France our first day.

NYC Landmark Theater!,"We were able to visit the New Amsterdam Theater for the first time and saw Aladdin. This beautiful theater is where my great aunt performed in the 1920's as a Ziegfeld Folly girl, so I was very excited to experience this! We had seats to the very far left in the theater which were a little tough, but the theater itself was very nice. I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. Very ornate, historical feeling, and beautiful. Aladdin was a great show (the Magic Carpet ride was incredibly done!). The theater was lovely and did not disappoint.

Proud of Pride!,"My step-brother recommended visiting Pride, and what a great recommendation! Pride is an incredible vineyard! The tour and tastings were both fabulous. We learned so much from our sommelier about the vineyard, wines, and the entire area. The windy road to the top of the mountain was gorgeous! I highly recommend visiting. Call to set up an appointment first as reservations are the way to go. The tour through the caves and grounds is well worth it.

"Craft brews, good food, nice setting","My daughter and son-in-law introduced us to Breckenridge Brewery. The four of us have been there many times, and just my husband and I have gone many times as well, so this review is not based on a one-time visit. We typically enjoy going for brunch or lunch on the weekends as there are a lot of fun things happening at the Farmhouse (food trucks, outdoor beer garden, corn hole, special events, and more). The food is quite good, and we all enjoy their craft beers (the Agave Wheat is my favorite, my hubby loves the 471 IPA Barrel Aged). Their beer flights are fun to try as well!
