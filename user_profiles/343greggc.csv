The Water taxi is a must!,"Loved the water taxi from Calis Beach to Fethiye. It only cost about £1.20 and was well worth the money.

Lovely hotel with hard working staff,"This hotel is fantastic!
Everything you need in one resort.
The family room was huge and cleaned everyday if required.

Staff are working so hard ensuring that COVID-19 safety is their number 1 priority.

The spa was very relaxing and John is a great asset to the spa team ensuring that the perfect massage was given.

My only gripe is the sun beds. There just wasn’t enough. Staff told me that we had to put out towel down between 6am and 7am to ensure a bed. This was uncomfortable with me and didn’t seem fair to others.
I feel if they could safely fit in more sun beds around the pool then they should somehow do this.
Apart from this, loved the hotel, pool, food, water sports, staff and entertainment (especially Tarzan who even got me up taking part in Zumba) were brilliant!

Beautiful hotel and total relaxation,"This was our first Hilton holiday (outside the UK and USA)

The hotel is amazing, staff are very attentive and polite and are always will to assist with anything we required.

There are 4 large outdoor pools (fun pool, over 16’s pool, family pool and quiet pool) and there were always sun beds available at one of the pools. Staff even assist you find a sunbed or move the sun shades if required.

The room was very tidy and in very good condition with lovely views of the Marina. (Or pools)

The only down side was a couple of silly mistakes made by staff...we were given a room to go to when we arrived from London only to find people In the room and the room allocated to another family.

The second mistake was I was charged 700 euros for the hotel, when I had already prepaid for the hotel! (In other words charged twice)

Staff were very apologetic and Front office Manager Andrea Farrugia rectified this and ensured I was not out of pocket.
These are just silly mistakes that a 5* hotel should not be getting wrong!

40 years later and I still thoroughly enjoy the food, scenery and atmosphere.

Those that expect the full menu may be a little disappointed as this is a village taverna and not everything is available every night! Go with the flow and enjoy what they offer! I’ll continue to come here on my holidays and will always look forward to eating at Platanos!",August 2018,Platanos Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2548644-d4177414-Reviews-Platanos_Taverna-Kato_Dhrys_Larnaka_District.html,"Kato Dhrys, Cyprus",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Negative reviews...,"We popped in for a drink and a Cypriot pudding.
Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. Staff were polite and friendly, drinks were slightly more than elsewhere, however the views outside are amazing so well worth the extra 50 cents each!

4 euros for 2 soft drinks...I’ve paid a lot Mrs In other countries!",August 2018,Lefkara Pavillon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1900120-d3774149-Reviews-Lefkara_Pavillon-Pano_Lefkara_Larnaka_District.html,"Pano Lefkara, Cyprus",restaurants,5.0,3.0
Lovely relaxing hotel,"We came here for our wedding anniversary and the hotel done everything they could to make this special.
Lovely room, amazing staff, petals on the bed and dinner table. It was a brilliant anniversary stay.

There was a prom at the hotel, but we couldn’t hear any noise and we didn’t even know they were there!

I can 100% recommend this Hilton and will definitely be returning.

Thank you for making our night special!",June 2018,Hilton Avisford Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186405-d192606-Reviews-Hilton_Avisford_Park-Arundel_Arun_District_West_Sussex_England.html,"Arundel, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,3.5
Father’s Day meal,"What a lovely meal.....it’s probably been 25 years since I last went to Chiquito’s Leicester Square.
The food at Crawley was amazing, the portion size was substantial, the price was a little high (thank goodness for the 30% off voucher!)
The cheesecake was out of this world!

I definitely won’t be waiting another 25 years for my next one!",June 2018,Chiquito - Crawley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187051-d2233485-Reviews-Chiquito_Crawley-Crawley_West_Sussex_England.html,"Crawley, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Oh wow...that was good!,"Yep....the burger was so good I actually wanted to go back the following day!
First time visit and I can’t believe I haven’t been before. The burger tasted fantastic and the atmosphere was out of this world.

My only gripe was the cost of a small bottle of diet coke....£3, where by if it was £2 I would of purchased 2 bottles, instead I just had the one!

Apart from the above I will definitely return soon!

Thank you!",April 2018,Eighty Ate Burger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g504181-d12001837-Reviews-Eighty_Ate_Burger-Reigate_Surrey_England.html,"Reigate, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing hotel!,"I absolutely loved this hotel. 2 nights in the family room with breakfast, lunch and Dinner included.
The room size was amazing and the food quality was out of this world!
The pool was cold (as it was April) but we still went in!! (Typical Brits)
Evening entertainment was also excellent!

I had previously stayed at Aqua Montague, but truth is...I think this is the better hotel!

Would I go again....I sure would!

My only negative...dinner drinks are a little pricey and I was told off for bringing a small bottle of water to the table!

Apart from the above...fantastic hotel, thank you!",April 2018,Aqua Hotel Onabrava & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635892-d282911-Reviews-Aqua_Hotel_Onabrava_Spa-Santa_Susanna_Catalonia.html,"Santa Susanna, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.5
My son loved it!,"Ok, so it is a little pricey, however you really do get value for money!
My son loved the tour and was so pleased to be at this famous stadium!

I can highly recommend this tour. Just a shame the VR headset was an additional fee on top of the entrance fee.",April 2018,Camp Nou,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d271009-Reviews-Camp_Nou-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5
Lovely afternoon tea,"We were welcomed by staff at the door and shown to the fire place where there was a yummy afternoon tea waiting for us.
It was so so nice! Staff were excellent, attentive and welcoming!
The food was so tasty and fresh and topped off by beautiful surroundings!
Would I go back for afternoon tea?? Oh yes!!",January 2018,Stanhill Court Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g191265-d1418389-Reviews-Stanhill_Court_Hotel-Horley_Surrey_England.html,"Horley, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Prices...what have you done?,"I think my title says a lot. For some reason each dish has gone up between 50p and £1 so my average meal use to cost £21 now with the price increase comes to £26!
I’ve been eating here for many years, however sadly with this increase, I’ll now be ordering less times and possibly looking elsewhere. This is such a shame as I liked it here!
When will businesses realise, charge a little less and your customers will come more often...charge more and guess what, they will not come!",January 2018,Monsoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g504181-d2632471-Reviews-Monsoon-Reigate_Surrey_England.html,"Reigate, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"Not the best, but still not bad","I think my title says it all.
This is my 5th year of Wimbledon Panto and though we enjoyed the show, it felt like it didn’t flow like previous years.
There was a lot of Al Murray stand up comedy (which was great) but when he and others went into the audience we couldn’t see anything (we were in the dress circle)
Maybe a camera showing us would of been good!
The other negative was £5 for a slush puppy drink. Yes I know it was in a fancy container, but all I wanted was a normal drink at a normal price.
Apart from this, the kids enjoyed most of it and the helicopter and 3D Show were the main parts that made the show unique!

Will I be there next year?? Of course I will but, I do hope they get it right!",December 2017,New Wimbledon Theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d3592032-Reviews-New_Wimbledon_Theatre-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.0
A yes from me,"I do like 5 guys. It just tastes yummy!

The only negative from me is the expensive price. £39 for 3 burgers, 1 large chips and 2 drinks!",December 2017,Five Guys,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d7791111-Reviews-Five_Guys-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
