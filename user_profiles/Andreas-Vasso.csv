Parhenon-Acropole-Athens-Hellas,"There are no words to express the awe I feel every time, and there are a lot of thems, I am somewhere around or beneath the ""Acropole Rock""', as we the Greeks like to call this Magnificent place.
Only the sight of Parthenon could be enough to make me contemplate the hole Monument for a long time !",May 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very Expensive,"I visited this place on the 9th of May and for two machine ice creams (soft), in a cup because they didn't have cones, they ask me 4 euros...!
Also, the receipt that they issued was for bread and not for ice cream.",May 2020,Attika Aptonoieia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7726429-Reviews-Attika_Aptonoieia-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Overall Average,"Very good quality of materials, very good taste, offered service below average, and significantly expensive for what you get, especially on the Takeaway.

Value for Money,"Nice people, always willing to serve you. Raw materials of excellent quality and the prices fair enough for this level of quality. Usually, lunchtime with family and a nice environment for small children too.",February 2020,1One,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2618353-d10176456-Reviews-1One-Cholargos_Attica.html,"Cholargos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Nice Hotel, average in Services","The main problem with this hotel is the offered services of their cuisine/restaurant. Breakfast quality below average, restaurant menu everything is hot & spicy. Furthermore, one day they were roasting meat within the area of the restaurant and above everything else they hadn't open the doors. As a result, the whole restaurant was filled up with smoke and smelled bad and if you say something they always say ""yes sir"" and do nothing !",February 2020,Avani Ibn Battuta Dubai Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d19253952-Reviews-Avani_Ibn_Battuta_Dubai_Hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,3.0,4.5
Worst Italian ever & a fraudulent Management,"Apart from a terrible experience regarding Italian food, It seems also that the management of this place is fraudulent ! About an hour ago, they answered to my google review (2* one more from this one) saying that I have made 2 different reviews, under 2 different names, while being ironical at the same time. This an unprofessional behaviorand big mistake, because this is my first review at TripAdvisor and unfortunately is even worse, if there was Zero star rating, I believe it would be the appropriate for this place...

Just for the story, my google account review is (a more simple one):
1. Bistecca = Beef Stake (no beef burger)
2. Tiramisu = Mascarpone cheese (no yogurt and especially not being soured!)
3. etc.",July 2019,Italida Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189403-d14181316-Reviews-Italida_Restaurant-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
