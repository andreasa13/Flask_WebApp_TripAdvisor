Acropolis Museum - awesome history of ancient Greece,"We were on a Viking Ocean tour of the museum and were very impressed by the ancient history contained herein. So much from ruins has been taken to other countries, or destroyed or sold in black markets; but the collection here is an excellent range of what existed back to the Athenians & Spartans and into the modern era.",October 2019,Skip the Line: Athens New Acropolis Museum Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12835132-Skip_the_Line_Athens_New_Acropolis_Museum_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
Acropolis - History in the Making,"One of the most famous places seen, the Acropolis is kept from development. The only drawback to this awesome place, is the long climb up the hill to it; we are in our 70's and this was a burden, but we did it. We attended on October 30th and there were several thousand people going. We were part of a tour group, our guide being very good at keeping us away from much of the crowd. Greece and the UNESCO people have done a good job keeping the Acropolis from being 'Disney-fied'. The ruins are everything you'd expect.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Private Greece Tours - Footsteps of St. Paul,"An excellent visit to many sites in Athens & Corinth where St Paul preached 2000 years ago. Tour guide, Katerina, was one of the best we've met; informative and interactive. Driver, Giorgio, had a wonderful sense of humor. We highly recommend this tour with so many historic and Biblical places to see. Katerina answered all questions with honesty and ensured we got to see areas without long line waits. The restaurant in Corinth was a great choice, with friendly staff and wonderful food. The only drawback, and this was unavoidable, was the traffic in Athens, which can be very heavy at times.

Top Highlights of the trip: (1) Aeros Pagos (Mars Hill) at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, where Paul spoke to the Athenians; (2) the Agora at Corinth, an amazing site well preserved and where Paul spoke to those that became Corinthians I&II in the Bible; (3) Kechries, which is the port area of Corinth and site of what may be the first Christian church built.

Two special side stops: (1) the Corinth Canal, built in 400 BC and still used today to connect the Aegean and Ionian Seas; (2) Marble & Ceramics Works shop in Corinth where they reproduce ancient art with confirmation by the Athens Museum. Both were great stops.",October 2019,Private Greece Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1924860-Reviews-Private_Greece_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
