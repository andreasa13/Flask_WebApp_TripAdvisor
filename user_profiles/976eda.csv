Dreamliner comfort,"Boarding was smooth and welcoming. Plenty of overhead locker space and a couple of pockets for books, devices and water bottle. USB charging. The seats were quiet comfortable for economy and good leg space. Refreshments were served soon after takeoff. An assortment of good wines and other beverages.
