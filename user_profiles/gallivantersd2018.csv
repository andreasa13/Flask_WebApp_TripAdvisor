Good outing but no whales,The day was good and the tour was well organized in terms of punctuality and efforts to spot whales. All we saw were baby dolphins in far distance.

Easy and convenient way to get South Coast overview,"The South Coast of Iceland is mesmerizing and we were pressed for time. This tour offered us a great way to be part of an organized tour. We thoroughly enjoyed this day trip. Although there is minimum flexibility in such trips, we were expecting so and were therefore not disappointed. This trip offered a good overview of the South Coast and we are planning to do a driving trip so be able to spend more time. The buses were nice and clean, our guide was knowledgebale and fun to be with. The tour was very punctual.

Loved our brunch date,This place is a bit pricey but totally worth going on a brunch date. The views are amazing and food pretty good. The service could do better and be more responsive but we were on a lazy brunch date so did not mind the speed of service.

"Great ambience and service, but limited range for a brunch","Loved the service and ambience. We were here for a Saturday brunch. The staff and the service was par excellence.

Good views but average food,We went here for a date lunch and were very pleased with the location and ambience. Sitting by the windows offers a romantic dining experience and the service is great.

Good value for money,Small cosy restaurant. Food is reasonably priced for the location and taste. The place could do better with cleanliness.

Good location and No frills Hotel,It's obviously a no frills hotel. The hotel is clean and bed is comfortable - that's what you need pretty much with a budget hotel.

Easily the best Souvlaki in Santorini,We loved it so much we made sure we had at least 1 souvlaki each day from this place. It's freshly prepared and mouth-watering tasty.

Simply the best in Santorini,"When we booked this hotel, we did not know how pleasantly surprised were we going to be! The location is simply perfect - the most photographed 3 bells church is just across the road. We got to see sunrise while lying in our beds. The hotel is conveniently located mid way between Oia and Fira. Breakfast spread is nice and comes with a splendid view.

Most rude staff and pathetic restaurant,"We wanted to eat a quick meal at 2 PM. The whole restaurant was empty but the staff did not let us sit down and eat. We were running late so to stop further wasting time in searching another restaurant, we decided to take away. At payment, the staff was so so rude - the guy kept saying the owner does not care, why should I. The owner is a millionaire sitting in Manchester and he doesn't give a damn.

Must Do in Santorini,"Perissa black sand beach is highly underrated. We loved our time here.

Breathtaking views and lovely wine,The USP of the place is its views. The wine was decent and the service was prompt with courteous staff.

Great entertainment and vibe but very average food,The overall ambience and the entertainment is unique and traditional. The service is great but the food was very average. We ordered the vegetarian set menu. Starters were the traditional humus with pita bread. The main course was an aubergine curry which wasn't too good. Even the dessert was a selection of ready made turkish delight and some cake. The food is definitely not worth going back.,April 2019,Kenza Restaurant & Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d802925-Reviews-Kenza_Restaurant_Lounge-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Delicious Pad Thai but average thai curry,We stopped over for a quick meal and were surprised with communal seating arrangement - so definitely not a place for a fine dine experience.

"Lovely location, good food and excellent service",Great location and excellent service - at par with what you would expect from a Michelin star restaurant.

Lovely dinner in a cosy restaurant,First I wish to speak about the place itself - its small and cozy and the decor inside is very traditional. The staff was courteous and the food is flavorful.

Decent enough for a couple of night's stay,The rooms were spacious and clean. The breakfast spread is fair and some other advantages include free parking.

"Great views, Limited menu options, Good Food and Service",First and foremost are the views from L-14. You get possibly the best view in Lucknow. We went for a family dinner and the range of options on the menu were fairly limited. The food itself was well made and at par with what we expected from a restaurant like L-14.

Average variety on menu and below average taste,"We went here for a family lunch. We are vegetarians and were expecting a decent variety of options on both starters and main courses. We were sad to see fairly few options - the same stuff was being repeated. That's not what you go for at a place like open buffet. I have had much much wider range of options are various other places around the world. The food itself was below average in taste.

Good arctic wilderness fun,We loved our day trip to Ranua from Rovaniemi. The zoo is well maintained with the animals well looked after. Watching Polar Bear is an experience in itself. There are several other interesting animals like white owls and reindeer which added to the experience. The whole tour takes about 3 hours to complete. The walking tour is clearly marked and so it helps to complete it without any assistance. There is a nice cafe at the entrance of the zoo and it serves good lunch options (even for us vegetarians).

Perfect dinner in the middle of Winter Wonderland,We went for dinner once and loved it so much that we went again the following evening. The place is amazing with real fireplace. The cabin restaurant is romantic and perfect for a dinner date - with white snow outside it makes for a perfect setting to sit by the window and sip red wine with your partner. The food is mouth-watering delicious. We are vegetarians and we found good options on the menu.

Stunning Finish experience in the heart of Lapland,"We stayed here for 3 nights and couldn't love it more. The location is excellent - close to all restaurants. The ski bus takes you from right in front of the cabin. The log cabins are everything you would ask for in Finland - warm and cosy and the excellent sauna. The check-in experience is a bit troublesome - you need to collect the keys from a supermarket next door. The breakfast spread is not too great either and that's why I give 4 stars.

"Comfortable rooms, average breakfast but good location",Location is the biggest advantage of this Novotel. It is next to tram station and 5 min tram journey from the area where all the offices are in Kirchberg. The staff is courteous. I did not like the breakfast spread - I have had much better spreads in cheaper hotels across major cities in Europe. The carpet in the room did not feel very clean but otherwise the room was clean.

Sadly we were here only for 1 night but I would prefer to go back to this place if I have a chance for a longer stay in Bergen. The hotel is very centrally located with views of the harbor from the room. We woke up to the views of the harbor with cruise ships lined up.

Worst hotel experience,"We reached at 2.30 PM to check-in (with check-in time given as 2 PM onwards) and were told that our rooms were not ready. There was a long line of people waiting in the lobby for the rooms to get ready. We were super tired and we insisted on getting a room early. We were then given a room in an adjascent building.

Worth the time and money and a quick overview of the Norwegian Fjords,"This is a short 3 hour fjord cruise which gives a good glimpse to what Norwegian fjords have to offer.

If you have more time, go for the regular day long cruises or hike along the hardanger fjord for more surreal scenic beauty.",August 2018,Roedne Fjord Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190502-d2282055-Reviews-Roedne_Fjord_Cruise-Bergen_Hordaland_Western_Norway.html,"Bergen, Norway",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Good for quick bite, Nice charm",The pub is a good place to grab a quick lunch in afternoon.

Delicious greek food but super slow service,"We simply loved the food, it was our first time for greek cuisine and we absolutely loved the food. The portions were good, ingredients fresh and mouthwatering delicious. The only complain is the the service was super slow. Food took too much time to prepare - possibly because everything was being freshly prepared when ordered, which is good. But the wait for food can be a bit longer.",August 2018,Hungry Donkey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d7885564-Reviews-Hungry_Donkey-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Authentic North Indian food in heart of Edinburgh,"I ended up here for a dinner. The quality of food was very nice and the staff was very friendly. The paneer recipe is mouthwatering. Giving only 4 star because when I turned up, i did not have an advance reservation. I was told that the restaurant is full but I had to request to give me a seat for 30 mins.",August 2018,Navadhanya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d9557814-Reviews-Navadhanya-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great day trip from London,"We did the entire hike from Seaford to Eastbourne. Although the hike is hard, you do it in awe of the place and your surroundings.

Nice Ethiopian experience,"It's a nice hidden place that we came to learn of through friends who love this place. There are quite a few vegetarian options on the menu and are reasonably flavourful. The injera was a bit too high on vinegar so while we enjoyed the overall dinner, it needed a bit more balance of flavors.",July 2018,Wolkite restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d3932437-Reviews-Wolkite_restaurant-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
