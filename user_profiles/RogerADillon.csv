A visit to Athens without going here is a wasted journey,"A considerable amount of the finds from the Acropolis are stored in this museum. The setting is exquisite with great views of the Acropolis and Parthenon from the upper floors. The layout is excellent and photographs can be taken in the majority of the areas containing exhibits. Entry cost is very reasonable in my opinion. Like the Acropolis, a visit to Athens is not complete without seeing the Acropolis Museum.",February 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A must to see,"One just cannot visit Athens without visiting the Acropolis and the Parthenon and no one could. The history of Athens and Greece itself is contained in this one site. Many people think that the Acropolis is the famous building one sees in Guide books etc of Athens, it is not. The Acropolis is the hill on which the building , The Parthenon, sits along with other buildings on the site , sits. My strong suggestion is that you Google both the Acropolis and the Parthenon before you visit as this will undoubtedly make your visit more interesting, educational and enjoyable.",February 2020,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Very pleasant experience,"Booked the hotel on recommendation of a friend who has stayed here. Our first night was spent in quite a small room but when the next morning I asked if there was a larger room available, the receptionist immediately was happy to move us and did so within 10 minutes. The rooms are comfortable and very clean as are all areas of the hotel. The staff are extremely helpful and pleasant and as the receptionist said want to make your stay as pleasant as possible. They have certainly succeeded !
The breakfast buffet has a wide variety of foodstuffs e.g. cereals, toast, meats, cheese, croissants, bread rolls, jams, orange juice, tea etc and exceptionally good filter coffee. I would certainly recommend the hotel, which is centrally located, and would return.",February 2020,Pan Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d614907-Reviews-Pan_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Great family restaurant with authentic Greek food,This was my 4th visit to Tsambikos and each time the food has been lovely and the hospitality the same. I ordered a pork chop knowing that they are large from previous visits however I was surprised at tonight's as it seemed I had been served half a pig. The chop was beautifully cooked and seasoned well as were the other dishes ordered by our party. We will return again (and again). Thank you!,October 2019,Taverna Tsambikos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635615-d4444048-Reviews-Taverna_Tsambikos-Kolimbia_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Authentic Greek cooking,"My friend had been here previously and thought it was excellent and we got around to going there a couple of weeks later. Guess what it was excellent. Alex the owner and does the grill and meat cooking was extremely welcoming and so friendly. His mother does the other preparation and cooking; hers are THE BEST dolmades I have ever had. We ordered too many Mezzes and unlike other taverns, Alex knew this so left some out unlike some I've been to where the owner is only too happy to make your bill higher. The food was great and all the staff ie Alex and his mother were great. If you are looking for authentic Greek cooking, I highly recommend this restaurant / taverna. You will definitely not be disappointed and like me you will go back. Whether you're in Pefkos, Lindos, Lardos Gennardi or any where close, take a little road trip and eat here. It doesnt have a large menu but that's because everything is fresh and home made by the owner and his mother but if you want something special which is Greek cuisine, ring him the day before and they will make it. You just have to go there!",July 2019,To Anoi Î¤ou Patouna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g12991268-d14035147-Reviews-To_Anoi_ou_Patouna-Laerma_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Pefkos main beach,"This is the most popular beach in the near vicinity of Pefkos. It has lots if sunbeds for the tourists to use, ample car parking almost literally on the beach and has a number of good eating places within 50m of the beach.",June 2018,Pefkos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g666539-d284698-Reviews-Pefkos_Beach-Pefkos_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Appreciation,"It's the first time in many years that we have eaten here and I was really pleased that we did. The food was excellent; I had Spaghetti Carbonara and it was everything that I could have hoped for and much better than the same dish I had in an Italian Restaurant a couple of days later. Our waitress ,who's name was Cathy, provided excellent service and was a bundle of fun and energy. The place caters for small and large groups and the children there clearly were enjoying their food and time there. Download the Frankie & Jenny's App before you go though and get some really good offers.",October 2017,Frankie & Bennys,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6012865-d731142-Reviews-Frankie_Bennys-Cribbs_Causeway_Gloucestershire_England.html,"Cribbs Causeway, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.5
A restaurant well worth visiting,We have been to this restaurant on 3 occasions and will definitely be returning again and again. This is a small (?) Family run restaurant just outside Kolombia 100m from traffic lights at Kolombi on the Seven Springs road. It obviously specialises in Greek cooking and is frequented by Greek families which is always a good sign of an excellent local restaurant. The family are really friendly and do everything they can to ensure you have a great visit at their establishment. The food is excellent as are their prices. The pork chops we ordered were the size of a T-Bone steak and beautifully cooked. The surprise at the end of your meal is that they give you ice cream and panacotta as well as some Greek liquor free. More than impressed with this restaurant and you will be if you visit. Go and try it and I'm sure you'll go back again,July 2017,Taverna Tsambikos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635615-d4444048-Reviews-Taverna_Tsambikos-Kolimbia_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
