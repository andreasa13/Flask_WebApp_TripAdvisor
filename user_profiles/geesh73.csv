Amazing.,"I have been wanting to visit the Acropolis for many years now, but was I not disappointed. It's an absolute must for anyone visiting Athens, the history, the views, the sense of awe. One word of advise is to take your passports, we didnt but the lady gave us the tickets at a discount for being EU citizens and let our children in free.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worst service thus far..,"My wife and daughter shared their keleftiko, in which my wife found a hair, she checked my daughters plate and found another. We obviously complained, the man who stands out front with the gift if the gab to entice people in, accused us of planting them ourselves! A shame as my son enjoyed his calamari. Had they not accused my wife of planting the hairs and been so rude I would give a better review.",February 2020,Ta Bakaliarakia tou Damigou,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1657004-Reviews-Ta_Bakaliarakia_tou_Damigou-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.0
"First, but not the last, visit","Being Indian and going out for an Indian meal is a bit of a busmans holiday....
However, we’ve heard good reviews about The Cottage and having driven past a few times and thinking we should visit, we decided to. We were certainly not disappointed. The food was lovely, the staff very friendly and attentive, the setting too (a grade II listed building no less). I would highly recommend visiting this restaurant. We’ll definitely be going again.",October 2018,The Cottage,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190764-d776540-Reviews-The_Cottage-Warrington_Cheshire_England.html,"Warrington, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
