"Great location, lovely hotel","Stayed here for a long weekend and was very impressed. It's in fantastic location with amazing views from some rooms. However if you really want views go up to the roof top bar / restaurant - it's amazing!

Breakfast has plenty of choice and very tasty.

Food & drinks are reasonably priced and there's a good selection.

Rooms are spacious with balconies but lacking a dressing table.

Overall, would definitely recommend.",March 2020,The Athens Gate Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d227384-Reviews-The_Athens_Gate_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Spectacular,The photos don't do it justice - make sure you visit in person. It's spectacular and walking up to the top gives you a real sense of perspective on the size of the place.

Brilliant zoo - so much to see!,"We arrived around 11 and the car park was filling up, however we still managed to get a space only a few minutes walk from the entrance.

The zoo is massive, we were there until closing time and still didn't manage to see all the animals. It's well laid out and easy to make your way round.

Suggest taking a picnic as the food is ok but over -priced.

Don't spend extra on the train it's not really worth it and you can walk just as easily.

Also, the free boat ride it good for giving little tired legs a rest but it's a bit boring.

We all had a brilliant time and I would happily go again.",July 2019,Chester Zoo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186233-d213872-Reviews-Chester_Zoo-Chester_Cheshire_England.html,"Chester, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Nice hotel, out dated decor & dodgy house keeping","I stayed 4 nights here and I would say that the room was comfortable and spacious with a large bathroom, however the decor of the hotel is very out dated and in places peeling off the wall.

The room wasn't cleaned to a standard of what I would expect and the hallway was clutters with pieces of furniture and a dirty rag that sat on the carpet for the duration of my visit.

The bar is non-existent and never open. The restaurant was of decent quality and the waiter very attentive.

Plenty of TV channels in all languages and a good mini bar in the room.

There was a server in our area but they weren't looking after our table, so we waited for some time before a waiter came up to take our order. The food came in a reasonable time, however we had no cutlery or napkins and again with no waiter to be seen to ask for them. We flagged down another waiter and eventually got some cutlery. There is a fixed menu Mon - Fri which is good value and I would recommend it. The quality of the food was spot on, however we had to wait again when he main course came to get more cutlery and order more drinks. Again, we had to wait to get our bill and pay.

"Lovely hotel, great rooms, fantastic staff, awesome food!","We arrived after already checking in on the App, which meant we could go straight to our room and use the phone as our key (love it!), however we realised that we had been allocated a room right next to the stairs, so we asked at reception if we could move to another room and they were more than accommodating, even offering a room upgrade!

The Club rooms are lovely with more space Sky Movies and a coffee maker. Since the weather was bad, we spent all day Saturday watching movies which was great.

The gym and pool are in excellent condition and free to use as a guest, there are times when the pool is busy with swimming lessons, but this is to be expected.

The staff at the bar and restaurant were polite, welcoming and helpful.

We eat in the restaurant on the first night and in the bar on the second night and we could not fault the food, my only criticism is that they've removed hash browns from breakfast.

"Great for the younger kids, not so much for teenagers","We visited one Saturday as a family and really enjoyed it.

We set off early, but I would say not early enough as the closer we got to Legoland the worse the traffic got, so although the park opens at 10, aim to be there earlier, we probably eventually got in about 10.45.

The park is really well laid out and there are queues the same as in any theme park, however note the rides are really aimed at primary school aged children, our teenager was bored for most of the day.

I was surprised by the cost of some of the food, it was actually reasonably priced(!) which is very unusual for a theme park.

However, on Friday the manager (I guess, although they didn't tell us exactly who they were) asked to speak to one of our group and asked us not to come back as we aren't spending enough money! Her argument is that we are taking up space that other customers could have & spend more money, like buying food.

I'm sure this is the case, however considering the place is normally dead (one of the reasons we go there, as there is normally loads of spare tables!), I would have thought that any money in the till would be better than no money - obviously not!

Lovely hotel in need of some TLC,"My husband booked this hotel for my birthday, it's easy to find in a good location and with lovely staff.

Easy to get into centre of Cardiff by walking to maintain road to catch bus or as we did walk 5 mins to train station.

Room was very spacious, I think we had a family room, but was really in need of an update, shower leaked all over the bathroom, no air con & cleaning could've been more thorough.

Staff were brilliant though, reception more than helpful and waiting staff attentive.

Overall facilities at this hotel are great, however compared with other Village hotels I've been to, it seems quite tired & in need of an update.",July 2015,Village Hotel Cardiff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186460-d1380524-Reviews-Village_Hotel_Cardiff-Cardiff_South_Wales_Wales.html,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,3.5
Another lovely stay with the best staff,"We stayed here as a family of 3 and as usual was impressed by the friendly & helpful staff. We unfortunately had a bereavement in the family and had to extend our stay and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.

Only issue we had was that there were 3 of us in the room however we were only given 2 towels, reception quickly rectified it though.

First time eating breakfast in the hotel as we normally go to the Toby carvery next door my husband's breakfast was fine however mine was slightly over cooked.

"Lovely people, great location, needs a it of love & care","Just back from a weeks holiday at this hotel and had a fantastic time. Everything clean, pools lovely, food fantastic and people so friendly & helpful.

We had a family rooms which was really spacious, however was in need of an upgrade to get to true 4* standard.

Entertainment team were fantastic, as were the chefs & waiters. My only criticism is that they could give you more information when you check-in, we spent most of the 1st morning finding out how to get towels, when the kids club opened, etc.

Definitely recommend this hotel, a wee bit (1km) away from the centre of Port el Kantaoui, however £1 / £2 in a taxi was well spent to see the lovely port and shopping district.",May 2015,Seabel Alhambra Beach Golf & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297952-d1547357-Reviews-Seabel_Alhambra_Beach_Golf_Spa-Port_El_Kantaoui_Sousse_Governorate.html,"Port El Kantaoui, Tunisia",hotels,4.0,4.5

Location is just outside of city centre so be prepared to walk or get a taxi getting around. However, restaurant across the road is nice as is sports bar if you're looking for cheap beer.

Decent but Too Hot!!!,"Nice little hotel next to the train station in Rugby and only about 10 mins walk from town.

Room is OK, bathroom is too small and the shower curtain is rubbish, as all it takes is for you to turn around and the curtain moves then water goes all over the floor. Also, no lock on the bathroom door. Only provided with 1 hand towel and no towel for the floor which isn't great.

Bed is really comfortable.

My biggest issue is that there is no air con in the rooms and it's absolutely boiling in the rooms!! We got a fan from reception, left the window open and still couldn't sleep. I don't understand why Travelodge didn't put air con in the rooms, its a brand new hotel?!?!?

"Its nice enough, but don't expect anything exceptional ...","We stayed here last night and weren't wowed - it's a nice enough hotel - well to be exact our room was great as we had a studio room - it was spacious and with a fantastic shower. My parents room however was just a standard double and wasn't very big and didn't have the Japanese shower.

My suggestion would be not to eat or drink in the hotel and just walk 5 mins into Wetherby, where the drinks and food are of the same (if not better) quality but cheaper by far! A round of drinks in the hotel cost £12, in town the same round was £9.30.

Tables were left with uncollected glasses for hours on end and my father had to complain about the corridor being left dirty for 2 days, so service wasn't exceptional.

The corridors are a bit dowdy and for an experience you have to try the lift! In all my life I have never seen anything like it!

Its a great location and could be a brilliant hotel, but it was a let down after the other Mercure's that we've stayed in.",May 2014,Mercure Wetherby Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190818-d192679-Reviews-Mercure_Wetherby_Hotel-Wetherby_Leeds_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Wetherby, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,3.5
"Outdated hotel, nice rooms, breakfast OK","I stayed here for 2 weeks in Sep 2013 on a business trip and found the hotel OK as Russian standards go, but really outdated on the decor. The rooms are pretty spacious, with full fridge and interesting mini bar, only Russian TV channels available though however there is free wi-fi available throughout the hotel which is fantastic (some western hotels should take note!). Room was always clean - but please note - no-one speaks English!

Breakfast was an interesting affair, with salad, eggs, cold meats and whatever was left over from dinner - but it was edible.

We held a 2 day conference in the hotel and the room was up to standard, with projector and facilities you would expect in any business hotel.

The best thing about the hotel though is the bar outside - the best beer in town and cheap too!",September 2013,Hotel Ahtuba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2529814-d1955436-Reviews-Hotel_Ahtuba-Volzhsky_Volgograd_Oblast_Southern_District.html,"Volzhsky, Russia",hotels,3.0,4.0

"Gorgeous hotel, brilliant food","We stayed here in March for our honeymoon and were so pleased with the whole resort - its beautiful, the staff are great and the food amazing!

We normally eat at the buffet for breakfast then one of the al-a-carte restaurants in the evening (Creole restaurant was amazing!). The only restaurant that I wouldn't go back to was the Indian, it wasn't bad but it just wasn't up to the standard of the others.

Pools are lovely, loads of sunbeds, however the adult pool does get busy early on.

Room was brilliant! Huge bed, always clean and the maid made special effort with the decoration in the room every day. Shower is the best ever!

Only downside is that the wi-fi in the rooms is too expensive - I wouldn't pay the money for it.
