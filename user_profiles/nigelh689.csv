However, this is a Marriott hotel and it delivers on the brand.

Checkin was smooth, received a good room, and found everything at the hotel convenient. The staff in particular were helpful and had a positive yes we can do that attitude.

Lisa, Linda, Charles and Joel led the way. Also impressive were my housemaids, and the restaurant staff. Actually, all the staff added to my stay.

The gym was good, overlooking a very useable swimming pool.

Loved the breakfast, but dinner was even better.

Gym was closed as was the Executive Lounge but the hotel gave me a few vouchers to use in their bar. Like a lot of the world you can easily catch covid in an Executive Lounge but it is impossible to get it in a Hotel Bar where you pay extra.

The rooms are a little dated and small, but the hotel has a good gym, a first class pool and a great breakfast. The Club Lounge is small, but has everything you need.

The annoying part of my stay was the keys cards didnt work most of the time. I made so many trips to reception to get them working. Still, not a biggie.

Ose in the restaurant was the standout member of staff. She had a friendly smile and was always busy. She really did enhance my stay.

It’s a bit hectic and disorganised, but the food was good and well presented.

For breakfast there was a buffet, that offered local and international food. I took my breakfast outside after the first day, aa it was less noisy.

The staff generally have poor customer service skills and looked unhappy. The exception was Ose, who had a charming smile and tried her best to keep up with the many demands asked of her. Appreciated the extra effort she made.

Can only assume the people that wrote those reviews got the address wrong and stayed in a different hotel.

Breakfast was disgusting. They had two hot dishes but one was gone by the time i got there and never refilled. Complained to management but they did nothing about it. Dont know how hygenic any of it was.

Whilst the hotel itself is a little dated, it has all the facilities required, and the location is in the City, not too far from the waterfront.

The key to any hotel are the staff. I would like to mention Raghida as she provided exceptional service. She was well presented, friendly and made sure where possible that my stay was as comfortable as could be. (she has been well selected and trained - congrats to management)

Nice check-in and given a huge room. Later - The check-out with Chris was even better, leaving a good impression.

Set on huge grounds and a golf course, if you like nature and the countryside, this place is perfect.

However, it is quite isolated so come prepared.

Given it’s size and location, this hotel should be offering full Marriott benefits including an Executive Lounge - sadly it does not. Another concept might be to consider all inclusive packages. The hotel is tucked away from everything, i personally like this, but perhaps it’s not for everyone.

The breakfast was very nice and at night there is ample outdoor seating overlooking the golf course and a pond to accomodate everyone’s tastes.

Gym, restaurants were closed, but we were allowed a basic service in the executive lounge. This was a takeaway service.

The COVID-19 excuse again !,"I’ve stayed at this hotel before, so I thought I knew what to expect.

Had a friendly checkin from Nadine, who gave me a sea view room when i requested it.

The room was nice, with a bathtub and tiny balcony, but it does have a seaview. Disappointed there is no tea or coffee in the room, just two small bottles of water.

Executive Lounge is also closed. I asked why, but no reason was given. This is also not shown on the website when you go to make a booking. It’s strange, as the bar upstairs was open, and there was even a wedding function held - no COVID-19 precautions in place. I think the hotel is cutting costs in this respect and not honouring the obligations set out under the Hilton Honors rules. Perhaps a compromise can be reached, like allowing members to use the bar with a meal in lieu of the lounge remaining closed? Or a $20 credit towards food and beverage.

My biggest disappointment was with the breakfast - bread, bread and more bread. No tomatoes, bacon, sausages, eggs, mushrooms, cold cuts, cheese or even cereal. Just bread. I advised reception i cannot eat just bread for breakfast and asked them to add two fried eggs. They did 21000 Lebanese pounds extra thank you very much. What a rip off.

In fact, the whole breakfast is a rip off. Sure they can provide eggs, but at a ridiculous cost. The guy who brought the uncovered food trolley to my room was not wearing a mask or gloves, so this has nothing to do with COVID-19. Simply trying to cut costs.

As i said i have stayed at this hotel before and enjoyed my stay. This is my first Hilton stay this year. At this stage I felt let down and think management needs to reconsider the services and amenities offered. In the meantime, the website for this hotel needs to mention continental breakfast in room only, and Executive Lounge closed.",July 2020,Hilton Beirut Downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294005-d15015703-Reviews-Hilton_Beirut_Downtown-Beirut.html,"Beirut, Lebanon",hotels,2.0,4.5

Terrible Breakfast,"I made a booking at the edelweiss hotel and was later advised by email that it was closed and my booking was transferred to the Royal Hotel.

The check-in was fine and my room was ok, just old and very small.

Breakfast was a joke. I seated myself and was acknowledged 5 minutes later by a waiter. After another 5 minutes he dropped off a bowl of bread and asked if i wanted tea or coffee.

He brought me some butter after 5 minutes - still frozen. Then after another 5 minutes some coffee.

About 15 minutes after this i waved him down and asked if i could order. Fried eggs and bacon please to which he said yes yes.

After i had finished the pot of coffee he came back and said no bacon was left. I asked him if he could get the chef to prepare some more.

5 minutes later he came back and said you are lucky, the chef has just arrived and is preparing your bacon now !

Another 5 minutes and another waiter brought me a ham and cheese omelette. I told him i didnt order it, i had ordered two fried eggs.

A few minutes later he brought out 2 fried eggs by themselves. I told him i had also ordered toast and bacon. He explained no bacon was left ! I told him the above story but he insisted no bacon. I asked for cooked ham instead. After 6-7 mins some chopped up ham arrived. I asked where is the toast? He apologised and said he will get some.

He then started clearing tables. My toast arrived 10 minutes later when my eggs were thoroughly cold.

Prison,"For those wishing to experience prison life without actually going to prison, the Niranta is perfect.

Noel/Nol ? Did a great job of checking us in. We preordered the American Breakfast - safest option? And asked if that included sausages and bacon. He actually phoned the ‘chef’ while we were there an he confirmed that it was included and available. Great Customer Service from Noel.

That’s where it ended.

My room was tiny with no window or view. Internet and television did not work. In an airport hotel you mainly want to rest or sleep. Not here, with paper thin walls and no noise control, almost impossible.

Breakfast arrived on time but was unedible. See pic. No bacon or sausages as promised and despite 3 phone calls and visiting reception, and many promises, they never turned up. The rest of the breakfast consisted of some sort of sloppy cereal, a sauce of some kind, 2 bits of milk bread and an overcooked omelette. This has resulted when someone is thrown into a job with no training and no desire to be there. How anybody could have pride in presenting that to a customer is beyond cognition. I think they called this person chef, maybe they have really good humour and I missed the point.

My recommendation is don’t under any circumstance stay at this hotel.",June 2020,Niranta Airport Transit Hotel & Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304554-d8430779-Reviews-Niranta_Airport_Transit_Hotel_Lounge-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",hotels,1.0,4.0
Management Fail,"30 minutes from Male, this little island provides a nice little getaway.

The cottages are world class, with immediate access to the sea from the ample decking. Luxury inside, practical outside.

The food was terrible. Ruined the whole stay.

Our booking was done through an agent, who only booked bed and breakfast. For a much lesser price, all inclusive was available on booking.com and Expedia. A huge mistake to go thru an agent - can only imagine there must be some dealings going on. Dinner would add over USD 50 per dayif you did not have all inclusive ...... plus drinks! I ordered some milk in my room for a cup of tea and they charged USD 10 !!!

The lesson here is don’t go to the Maldives unless you have all inclusive.

We tried to upgrade to all inclusive but management held fast on 90USD a day. We offered 70 but no negotiation so we held fast and went basic. They missed out !

Expedia offered the rooms all inclusive for 150. (Something doesnt add up here???)

The service was friendly and welcoming, but the stay was ruined by management not willing to negotiate and poor quality food. I have stayed at other islands at lessor prices who offer much better quality. I would not go back here.",June 2020,Cinnamon Dhonveli Maldives,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2104408-d594693-Reviews-Cinnamon_Dhonveli_Maldives-Farukolhufushi_Island.html,Farukolhufushi Island,hotels,3.0,4.5

It will do,"Great little hotel very close to the promenade and the beach.

Friendly staff - special mention to Julie who provided a superb checkin. She also gave me a great upgrade.

The business centre was not set up so i experienced a delay for its use. Also the keyboards are set up in a different type to what is on the keyboard. Very difficult to use - not much common sense shown there.

Breakfast was average.

The bar upstairs is unappealing and overpriced. Nice pool though. Gave it a wide berth and went to some local bars with atmosphere and 30% cheaper drinks.

Tough Times,"This hotel was open during COVID-19 and was worth a visit.

Mohamed on reception welcomed us and was very professional, didnt miss a thing. He started the stay on an ideal note.

My room was exceptional, one of the best i’ve had. Perfect bathroom.

Gym, restaurants were closed, but we were allowed a basic service in the executive lounge. This was a takeaway service. Not sure why the drinks were limited to 2, or how this prevents the spread of the virus. However , Winona was the star of the hotel. Like Mohamed, she has been well selected and well trained. Congrats to management on that. Her service was superb, and she coped with many guests by herself. Great personality too.

Nice arrival greeted by friendly staff. Offered a check-in upstairs in the Executive Lounge. Quick and comfortable check-in with a welcome drink.

Fantastic room, with a large bathroom containing a bath, and a seperate lounge. Perfect.

Nice views, and modern. Throughout my stay Liz was my room attendant and she did a wonderful job.

The gym is good, and breakfast is World Class. All the staff I encountered were well selected and well trained.

The Executive Lounge has everything and more. Jenny the Customer Relations Manager introduced herself and made sure I felt welcome. The Lounge has the best views in town, and ample seating. A huge plus, is it also serve real food - not just snacks or nibbles, but a buffet of well prepared and well presented hot and cold dishes. In addition to this, they actually have chefs on-site preparing a few dishes as well. Talk about being spoilt.

A special mention to Alyzza. Pure Class. If I had a hotel she would be my first pick.

Areas for improvement:

1 Internet. This was poor. Disconnected after approx 5 mins continually. So frustrating.

2 Breakfast was the same everyday. Having 10 different cheese type does not make a breakfast. This was 3 star standard. (Except the Humous) Needs a specialty dish or two each day. The Chefs are friendly and definitely capable, give them a little leeway to show their skill.
