Brilliant - a must do if on Donegal!,"Was so happy with my experience at Wild Ireland, we spent a happy two hours here. They have really built and created a wonderful home for these animals and it was just wonderful to watch them. Very C19 aware and felt very safe and clean, when we did the talks everyone wore masks and kept comfortable distance from each other. They have it as a one way system and you can go around as many times as you like. We went twice, if you can make sure you catch the talks very informative and for us we got to see the bears feed on apples and oranges which was really remarkable. The wolvea are just stuning could watch them all day. We got to see then play fight and run around which was so cool. A brilliant experience and will go again as I feel every time you would go, you would see the animals do something new. Highly recommend and they also have tea/coffee/ice cream and picnic tables.",October 2020,Wild Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3395491-d19262573-Reviews-Wild_Ireland-Burnfoot_County_Donegal.html,"Burnfoot, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Our favourite restaurant in our trip to Greece,"Spent two weeks in Greece and had lots of yummy food but hands down our favourite restaurant we ate the whole trip. Wonderful menus with some delicious and different items on. Their own wine and really friendly and nice staff! Go you will not be disappointed! Trust me in Thessaloniki where there is so many places to choose, make the effort to go here you will not regret!",October 2019,P 22,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189473-d6874574-Reviews-P_22-Thessaloniki_Thessaloniki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,"Thessaloniki, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful and amazing views. Go in the evening time when its quieter.,A must for Athens. But go in the evening we went at 5 PM to avoid the crowds that come in the morning (its crazy). You can buy ticket online for this ... just Google so thats another quick step. Also if you want amazing photos of this go to the observatory hill in Athens and you will get an unspoiled view of this. Enjoy!,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing and yummy food great quality and very tasty!,"Very happy with the food we had here! We got one of the beef burgers and the veggie burger. Both pf us were really happy with our choices and they were devoured (one of those burgers you want to savour and enjoy but it's so good you nom nom it right up)! Very happy with taste and quality of food. I also got the garlic and parmesan chips with rosemary... just amazing! Great service, friendly staff, nice sitting area. Good burgers done well... they also do chicken wings which I will have to come back and try. Definitely recommend checking this place out if in Monaghan town.",June 2019,The Bap Stop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186630-d17455842-Reviews-The_Bap_Stop-Monaghan_County_Monaghan.html,"Monaghan, Ireland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing!,Wow just amazing! Make sure you visit it and the rest of palatine hill. It truly is amazing we made the pointerview of scheduling around and 4 hours to enjoy it and could have taken more time. Handy tip if you are using hop on hop off buses when you get off at the stop walk down the road away from Cilessuem and about 3 mins down the road is a second entrance with no queues. Like not one person in front of me to buy a ticket which allows you into Palatine hill and the Coleseuem.,September 2018,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very friendly staff!,We stayed in an apartment close to this cafe and hands down the staff here are the most friendliest and welcoming we came across our trip. Great place to get a glass of wine and some nibbles. Pasta dishes also very good.recommend!,October 2018,433 Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d2346439-Reviews-433_Restaurant-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing best Tapas I have ever had!,Wow what a treat it was eating here highly recommend!There is a menu option for a range of dishes to come out which suited our table of 4 perfectly. Each dish was a treat and to be savored! Nicely timed between each one so it's a lesiurely evening experience with gorgeous and tasty food coming out just when you are ready for the next one. The dessert menu was also amazing and I highly recommend the honey and ice cream if it's on the menu when you visit. Go it honestay one of the best meals I had in my two week trip around Portugal and Rome! Hosts are lovely as well.,September 2018,No de Gosto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g285715-d12629297-Reviews-No_de_Gosto-Tavira_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Tavira, Portugal",restaurants,5.0,4.5

So happy we went here!,"Staying in Killala area over the Easter weekend, made the wonderful choice of staying in Killala for diner on the Saturday night and went to The Open Door. It honestly was some of the best food I have had in the last while. Amazing flavors, simple menu with a few specials of the day, I am honestly drooling thinking about them!! The ladies that served us could not have been more hospitable and welcoming, but also happily left us in peace to catch up with family we had not seen in a while. Even though we hardly had room for it, we ordered dessert and have to say the Baked Alaska, Berry Crumble and Chocolate Fondant were all amazing with their own little cleaver twists. Highly recommend going here, thank you for the lovely evening!",April 2018,The Open Door Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g212984-d6555555-Reviews-The_Open_Door_Restaurant-Killala_County_Mayo_Western_Ireland.html,"Killala, Ireland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Staff let this place down - Not a 4 star hotel!,"Stayed for one night here - part of deal with Spa, Diner and Breakfast included. Room was nice, location pretty and quiet - all the requirements for a special trip away. However waiting staff just ruined the experience, arrived on Saturday afternoon and was booked into Spa for 5PM went to bar and ordered two sandwiches at 4 PM - waited 50 Minutes for them to arrive, bar was not busy and this is a golf course bar - kitchen should expect to have people in from 3 PM onwards on a Saturday! Had to call down to Spa to let them know we will be late - when food arrived no apology, no explanation no nothing. Spa was nice - felt a little tired and little things were missing - no cups at water dispenser and blankets on all the chill out seats. But view is really nice and treatment was nice! Food at diner was lovely huge thumbs up, but waitress just give the vibe she could not care less, she insisted that I order my dessert at the start or else they would charge the full price for it later (which makes no sense, just bring down the menu again after main course has been served)! Breakfast same experience - went down at 10 AM 30 minutes before it was finished - there was no pastries left and were not restocked, ordered scrambled eggs and smoked salmon. Watched a waiter carry it out to wrong table, I was waving at him - he took it back to kitchen where it sat for 10 mins, meanwhile no one else of the 6 other staff would come near our table. Eventually came back out, eggs were rock solid and unediable and there was a piece of plastic string in the smoked salmon. Had to go to kitchen door to get syrup from waiter for partners pancake as they all seemed to be hiding in the kitchen! I was just annoyed at that point and wanted out! Went to check out and then they there was a charge from the bar to our room which we did not make - they did not charge me for it but it was just the annoying cherry on top of an overall disappointing trip. Hotel has potential but staff really needs to up their game!! Which is funny I have stayed many places and usually the place is not nice but the staff save it - first place I have ever stayed where the staff have ruined the overall experience for me.",March 2017,Castle Dargan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1438856-d620876-Reviews-Castle_Dargan-Ballygawley_County_Sligo_Western_Ireland.html,"Ballygawley, Ireland",hotels,2.0,4.0
