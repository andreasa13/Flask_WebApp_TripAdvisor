Ridicilous,"I wanted to book a transfer from the Airport Innsbruck to Mayrhofen for my friend and me, in case of that we both was looking in the internet for a transfer for us my friend who was in the uk told me the price to mayrhofen it was showing to him more expensive than to me at the same time we was phoning on the phone and we was shocked how they could cheat on us about the prices to show in every country different prices so we booked on a other safe company who offered for us both the same price a local originaly airport taxi who is also on the innsbruck airport at the first tabella.
