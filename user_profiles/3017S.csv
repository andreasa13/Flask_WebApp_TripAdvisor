Iconic site,"You cannot visit Athens and not climb up to the Parthenon. It is not a difficult climb. You just need to be careful where you step in case it might be slippy. The you stand in awe at what was done so long ago. But think of the cost in human life. It must have been massive. It was all for the Gods. I see a lot of reviews advising where and when to climb it. We were there in early April, around mid-day and it was not overcrowded.

You have gotta go. Its a tourist thing.,"This area has all the usual kind thinhs you find in Tourist Trap places but this is better than most because of the gracious Greek people.

Bucket list must do,"I thought it looked better from the Ancient Agora than when you are actually up there but I was glad I went up. Fantastic view of Athens and surrounding area. Great history. Like so much of today, Vanity, Greed, War, Destroy and start all over again. Lessons for mankind. But it stand so proudly over the city!! We are in our latter 70s and approached the climb with some worry after seeing all the advice about slipping and how difficult it might be. It is not a very difficult climb but you have to mind your step. Much wear has left areas slippery and particularly if it rains.

Great but a little boring.,"You see so much of same, one after the other. However it is all very pleasant. Well laid out. New building and great piece of modern architecture.

Best in the neighbourhood for food and value,"It seems to be mezze and do not order all the course together. That was the only mistake but it was ours.
Order one or two. Have a nice wine. Take it slowly. If order is hot/warm maybe order it on its own. They do not rush you. Its a nice building, an old school house converted. It has a big garden for outdoor eating but it was cold when we were there. Inside has a good feel to it. The food is great. I was not as pleased with the wine and there was little guidance. It was all bottled.

Good food close to Lincoln Centre.,"We had not booked and so had to share a high table to with other couples. Very nice and interesting people. The seats are a little too high for some people to mount them elegantly. The food was interesting and good.

Expensive for what you get.,"It is very well located, within 5 mins walk to city centre. The Bedroom is clean and quiet. The breakfast is very good and prepares you for the day.

Relaxing Hotel offering value for money.,This is a popular place for families. Plenty of facilities. We are in the bar and the food was great in quality and value. Pleasant walks around the hotel on the shore of a lake. Should be good for fishermen. Relaxing. Good bedrooms. Pleasant staff.

Unexpected delight,"This Restaurant is on the main drag in Ranelagh villlage, Dublin and is within 100 yars of the LUAS station.

"5 star but only 1 toilet,",Great sushi food and small good wine list. All at reasonable prices. This is a small restaurant with seating for 40 approx. But you are not crowded. Service is delightful and you will not be rushed. The food is as good as the best Dublin has to offer in sushi. The one pity is is has only one toilet cubicle for all customers regardless of gender.

Big Day Out,You need to give the time. Be there early and enjoy the talks by the zoo keepers and get to see more. I haven't been here since 1978 and it is so different. DSpend the whole day and there are lots of refuelling stops. Plenty of toilets. No more of the caged animals. They all looked relaxed and well cared for.

Good sleep in nice hotel at reasonable price,"The bedrooms is away from the bar and ballroom and this leaves them quiet. So you can have good sleep.

Worth seeking out this Hidden gem.,"Booked in to this Hotel for a few nights to attend a family wedding. Had family get together meal in the restaurant and it was very good in spite of there being a wedding meal for over 100 people being served in the Ballroom. Breakfast is self service. What you get is excellent but the choice of cooked items isn't as wide as other hotels. Our party was very happy with it.
The rooms are a good size with good beds and very clean. The staff are very friendly and obliging. It seems to be very popular for weddings and this might lead to some noise on such nights. Therefore ask in advance re weddings and seek an quiet room away for the Ballroom noise. They have plenty of quiet rooms. It is worth going out of your way to try this hotel if you are touring the midlands or going west. It has a leisure centre with swimming pool which I did not use.",March 2017,Abbey Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315887-d482153-Reviews-Abbey_Hotel-Roscommon_County_Roscommon_Western_Ireland.html,"Roscommon, Ireland",hotels,5.0,4.0

Great food and service.,"It has a nice atmosphere. We were made feel welcome. The food is great and good value. It is not pretentious. They don't tell you where every ingredient comes from, like some places. Three had fish dishes and one steak.

Could be much better,"This hotel is very reasonably priced. However it has a lonely atmosphere. The lights are on sensors in the corridors and other places which means you walk into a darkened area. The lights are quick to react but it creates the wrong atmosphere. Bar food dinner is poor. There is a very good pool, steam room and sauna but were unattended on my visit. I fould it difficult to find on a dark wet night. My Garmin didn't show it. But google maps has it. It might improve. I think it has been recently taken over from Radisson.
