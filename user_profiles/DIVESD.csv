Cameo Earrings,"We stopped at Apa 1848 while on an excursion to Pompeii. We were able to see them making cameos and they explained the process. It is very delicate work.
There was no pressure to buy anything, but I couldn't resist since I had been wanting some cameo earrings. There are a variety of items in different price ranges so they can be affordable.
I have really enjoyed wearing my earrings since I returned and have received many compliments. Jewelry is always a good souvenir because each time I wear it, it brings back fond memories of our vacation!",August 2019,Apa 1848,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1063524-d12653838-Reviews-Apa_1848-Torre_Del_Greco_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Torre Del Greco, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
A Highlight of Our Trip!,"We visited Pompeii on a cruise ship excursion. Although it was listed as strenuous, we are in our 70's and found it very doable.
I found the area fascinating. It is hard to imagine that they had running water and sewers in 79 AD.
It is poignant to see the preserved body and other artifacts from an advanced society.
Be sure to have a guide because the complex is huge and they know which areas are best. Plus he explained about interesting things we would not even have noticed on our own.
In my opinion, Pompeii is not to be missed!",August 2019,Pompeii Archaeological Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187786-d195477-Reviews-Pompeii_Archaeological_Park-Pompeii_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Pompeii, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Unbelievable Views!,"We visited Santorini and Fira on a cruise. We took a ship excursion which took us by bus up to Fira rather than by cable car. The views are stunning!
It is hard to describe how beautiful it is to look off the side of the mountain, where everything is perched, down into the caldera.
We spent our day wandering around the shopping area and enjoying the little sidewalk cafes. (Yum - gelato!) It was a very relaxing day.
We bought some jewelry made of orichalcum and lava stone from the artist- Emmanouelo in a little shop in the Fabrika. Meeting the artist, makes it a very special sourvenir.
We really enjoyed our day in Santorini and Fira.",August 2019,Three Bells of Fira,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482942-d12900632-Reviews-Three_Bells_of_Fira-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Relaxing Cruise Stop,"We visited Messina while on a Mediterranean Cruise. We decided to spend the day relaxing so we took a short walk from the ship to the Cathedral Square (Piazza Duomo).
There is a fountain and a 180 foot bell tower with the famous astronomical clock.
We enjoyed shopping in the little shops and with street vendors in the square. Don't forget to buy some lemoncello! There was even entertainment in the square!

Well Organized and Informative Tour,"We took the ""Half-Day Bus Tour in Athens, Acropolis and Acropolis Museum Tour"" with Athens Tours Greece. The price included a guide, all entry tickets and transportation from our city center hotel and back.
Everything was well organized and happened on schedule.
We started with a tour around the city to see the Panathenaic Stadium, Hadrian's Arch, and Constitution Square among other things. Then we went to the Acropolis Museum.
The Museum is beautiful. Very clean, bright and modern. Our excellent guide explained all the things we were seeing. The Museum has a great view of the Acropolis. I loved the glass floor exposing excavations below.
We then walked up the Acropolis. This is not an easy climb but doable. We are in our 70's and made it to the top. The view of the City of Athens in breathtaking. The Parthenon (a temple to the Goddess Athena) and the Porch of the Maidens are a page from the history books.

A Beautiful Museum,"The Acropolis Museum is beautiful with a modernistic design. It is bright with lots of natural light and wonderful displays.
As you enter the museum, you walk over a glass floor allowing you to view an excavation of artifacts below. There is a great view of the Acropolis from the museum.
The displays are artifacts from the temples on the Acropolis. A guide is very beneficial to explain the history of what you are seeing.

A Page From The History Books,"I loved Europe because I finally saw all the things I only studied about in books. The Acropolis is a perfect example of this. The Parthenon (the temple to the goddess Athena) on top of the Acropolis towers over the city and is visible from many locations including our hotel.
Nothing compares to actually climbing up and seeing it up close. A bonus is the spectacular view of Athens. It is not an easy climb especially in August. But we are over 70 and did it!

Nice Newer Hotel,"We stayed for the first time at the Quality Inn and Suites in Sioux Falls. We chose it because of its proximity to I-90.
The appearance is nice and the staff is welcoming.
Our room was spacious with a seating area and in very good condition. The breakfast buffet offered a good variety of items.
We took advantage of the pool and hot tub area.

Beautiful Hotel But Expensive Food,"We stayed at the InterContinental Athenaeum during our stay in Athens.
It is a very beauiful hotel with professional service. However, be prepared - food is very expensive.
We ate several meals in the Cafe Vienna. Service was excellent. Bread was served in a cute little bread box. We ate club sandwiches, chicken and rice soup etc. We drank the regular water. A club sandwich was about 20 Euro each. The soup was 12. One time we had two small bottled cokes and it was 15 Euro.
The breakfast buffet was included with our room. It was extensive with fresh fruit and meats but if it is not included with your room, the price is 38 Euro per person.
Our room was nice although our view was of an abandoned building. While we had free WiFi, we couldn't find any free TV. According to the screen, there was a charge so we didn't go further.
We enjoyed the tropical atmosphere of the outdoor swimming pool. A dip felt really refreshing after climbing the Acropolis.
While we enjoyed our stay, if we return to Athens, we will probably choose a different hotel.",September 2019,InterContinental Athenaeum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d233052-Reviews-InterContinental_Athenaeum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Nice Rooms but Confusing Layout and No Indoor Pool,"We spent two nights at the Crowne Plaza as part of a reunion event. Check-in was fine until I tried to find the elevator. I asked the desk clerk and she said turn and go down the hall. I couldn't figure out which hallway to turn into. Then I came to the elevators for the meeting rooms which did not go up to my floor. I asked three times before I finally found the elevator. A map and more signage would certainly help this situation.
Our room was nice and we had no complaints. We were disappointed there was no indoor pool or hot tub. The outdoor pool looked nice but we did not have nice weather. Considering how many months Illinois is cold, this doesn't seem like a very wise choice.
The meeting room and food were very good for our dinner and dance.
Breakfast was included with our room. Note this is not always the case. The breakfast buffet was very good with fresh fruits, scrambled eggs, bacon, etc. and we even had a waitier who brought us coffee and juice.
I expected more from a Crowne Plaza. We would probably not choose to stay here again unless it was for a meeting.",September 2019,Crowne Plaza Hotel Chicago - Northbrook,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g36464-d87923-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_Hotel_Chicago_Northbrook-Northbrook_Illinois.html,"Northbrook, Illinois",hotels,3.0,4.0
Reunion Visit,"We visited Hackney's on Lake as part of a High School Reunion. We were in a small meeting room. We were served hors d'oervres which were delicious. I particularly remember the little quesadillas.
After the snacks, we weren't very hungry so instead of ordering a meal, we ordered the blooming onion. It was not very good.

Irish Comfort Food,"We ate at the Dublin Bay Irish Pub while visiting a friend in Ames. It was a beautiful fall evening so we ate on the patio.
We started with Strawberry Lemonade Sangria.Then there is no better comfort food than a deliciious Shepherd's Pie. Don't pass up the yummy Bailey's Pie for dessert. It was big enough to share. Attached is part of the menu with some of the other options available.

Nice New Hotel But No Hot Tub,"We stayed at the Comfort Inn ISU while traveling through Iowa. We were surprised to find it was a brand new hotel. Everything sparkled!
Check-in was fast and friendly. Our room was huge. I had inadvertently booked an accessible room and I think that is why it was so large. The bathroom was almost as big as some motel rooms. I was surprised it had a bathtub since it appeared to be a handicapped room with a lot of grab bars.
I assumed all Comfort Inns had hot tubs so we were disappointed after a long day of driving to find they didn't have one.
Breakfast was very good and included delicious homemade cinnamon rolls. Definitely a plus! Karina, the breakfast staff person, was very friendly, and we enjoyed visiting with her.

Breathtaking Views,"We visited Kotor on a cruise ship. The views going into the bay are just breathtaking.
We took a ship excursion which was ""lunch in a local home."" It exceeded our expectations. We first took a tour of the local market filled with fresh fruit and vegetables.

Our very talented and gracious hostess, Vlasta Mandic, welcomed us into her charming home. She entertained us by playing the piano and demonstrated making gnocchi. We had a lovely lunch of antipasto, gnocchi with beef and gravy, and a creamy layered dessert. It was completed with locally made wines.

After our lunch, we walked around the charming old town area of Kotor.

Very Enjoyable Lunch,"We always enjoy a stop in Keystone. We love walking around looking at the gift shops.
We stopped at the Ruby House Restaurant for lunch. It has a fun old west atmosphere. Service was fast and friendly.
We really enjoyed our chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. We shared an unusual berry (I can't remember the name) ice cream. Only $1.99 and it was delicious. We thought the prices were very reasonable for a tourist area.

I WANT TO DO IT AGAIN!,"We were in the Black Hills and wanted to do something new. So we went on a helicopter ride with Black Hills Aerial Adventures.

They have three different locations and we left from Keystone. The staff was very friendly and efficiently took care of everyone. They even offered to take our picture at the end of the tour.

I was concerned it might be scary or I might get airsick. Even though I was in the front seat with a glass window to the floor, I wasn't. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Keystone, Mt. Rushmore and Horse Thief Lake from a different perspective.

We felt the cost was reasonable at $105 per person in comparison to other rides we have priced. They have different tours with different prices.

SERVICE WITH A SMILE,"Obviously we love Secrets Aura in Cozumel. We look forward to seeing the wonderful staff every year. Many of them we have known for the eleven years that we have been visiting. Thanks Nelly Bass for your first-rate service. It is always a joy to see Fernando Yam’s huge smile “welcoming us home”. The “other” concierge express Fernando is always sociable too. Milly Oss our Preferred Pool Concierge brightened our days. Jesus is an outstanding bartender.

We stayed in Ocean Front Preferred suite – 914. Our room was perfect (except for no towel animals) including plenty of hot water and cold air conditioning. The convenience and view of an Ocean Front room can’t be beat.

We love the leisurely dining in the unlimited, no reservation specialty restaurants. We really missed breakfast at Oceana because it did not open until 8:30 this year. We are early risers so we ate at the buffet (which opens at 7:00) every morning except once when we simply had to have the Eggs Benedict and waffles with chocolate mousse.
We discovered the lunch menu had also changed considerably at Oceana. Most dishes were a seafood mixture. I need to know exactly what seafood it is so we avoided those dishes. Also the ribs (my favorite) were no longer on the menu however they are available at times in the Buffet and on the room service menu. Antonio provided exceptional service at Oceana.

We ate most breakfasts and lunches at the Market Café Buffet. Margarito, a superb waiter, made sure I had all the ribs I wanted. The very personable Yuritza will brighten your day as she seats you. Marcos always provides tremendous service. We also enjoyed great service by Adrian and Erick.

At dinner in Oceana, Capitan Luis does a fantastic job. One evening he found us some ice cream when we just wanted a little snack. Unfortunately my favorite dishes - crab cakes and coconut shrimp were no longer available. I ordered the Surf and Turf which was supposed to be coconut shrimp but it wasn’t. I never saw the flaming Mayan Coffee this year. I know it takes quite a bit of the waiter’s time but it is the special touches that makes a vacation memorable.

At Bordeaux, we love the French onion soup and filet mignon. We really miss the special dishes made at the table like the melted cheese and flaming Bananas Foster. A highlight of our week was the private dinner at La Cava (the wine cellar next to Bordeaux.) Our private waiter was Capitan Extraordinaire Joseph. Joseph is a true asset to Secrets Aura.

In the evening, Market Café now becomes a steakhouse. The steak was excellent and came with a choice of toppings such as mushrooms or peppers and service by Jose Antonio was delightful. This is a great idea!

We ate at Windows in order to have Angel as our fabulous waiter even though the food was not our favorite.

We discovered quite by accident that Coco Café has ice cream. So if you are looking for some, now you know!

We never tire of returning home to Secrets Aura. We treasure the relaxing atmosphere and the beautiful setting, but mainly the staff who have become friends.

¡Hasta el próximo año!

Great for Early / Late Flights!,"We recently stayed at the AeroStay Motel connected to the Sioux Falls Airport. We were very pleased with our nice well maintained room overlooking the runway. We enjoyed watching the planes but thankfully we couldn’t hear them.
We were really glad we were staying there because we had a 6:00 a.m. flight and the return flight arrived at 11:30 p.m. Add the snow and ice that occurred while we were gone and we were even happier with the decision.
To get to the airport, you wheel your luggage through the lobby door into the airport. No need to go outside. It’s a short distance and very easy. There were also a couple of restaurants (Marlins and Subway) outside of security for meals if you don’t want to drive somewhere.
They also have a park and fly package that saves you a little on the long term parking. If you are gone longer than the seven days, you just pay the airport directly for the additional days.
Be aware that the hotel is quite bare bones. The room does not have a bathtub, refrigerator, closet or safe. There is no swimming pool, hot tub or included breakfast.
Be sure to ask for a receipt at checkout. There was a discrepancy between the confirmation and the amount we were being charged. The hotel did remedy the situation.
We will definitely stay here again when flying out of Sioux Falls.",April 2019,AeroStay Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g54805-d7949575-Reviews-AeroStay_Hotel-Sioux_Falls_South_Dakota.html,"Sioux Falls, South Dakota",hotels,4.0,4.5
They Thought of Everything!,"From the moment we entered the Comfort Inn & Suites, we were impressed. The lobby is very attractive and we were greeted by the very friendly desk clerk. Check-In was quick and she described all the hotel amenities and even recommended a restaurant for dinner. (Which was close and very good.) We have never received a slip of paper before with all the details such as the hours for the pool and breakfast plus the free breakfast menu.

We were offered snacks and our name was on the board because of our status with Choice hotels. Besides the welcome cookies and ice water (with lemon), we were surprised they offered chicken noodle soup in the lobby.

Our room was large with a room divider and a sofa and comfy chair. Everything was very up to date. There was a microwave, refrigerator & coffee pot. We enjoyed the large shower with a modern glass door. We also took advantage of the pool area and hot tub. Nowhere did I notice any maintenance issues.

The Free Breakfast was excellent. My favorites were the waffles with strawberries and whipped cream and the biscuits and gravy. There were also scrambled eggs and sausage plus a variety of healthy options.

Also a first for us, was receiving a ""thank you for your stay"" letter. Since we were using points and our night was free, there was no bill but they reiterated that we didn't need to do anything but turn our keys in.

A very nice touch! They really did think of everything.",March 2019,Comfort Inn & Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g54805-d6107115-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Suites-Sioux_Falls_South_Dakota.html,"Sioux Falls, South Dakota",hotels,5.0,4.5
More Than A Bar & Grill,"We ate at Krav'n upon the recommendation of our hotel clerk. We were a little skeptical about a Bar & Grill but were pleasantly surprised with the variety offered on their menu.

It was a tough decision but we chose the Prime Rib Sandwiches. I had the potato salad as a side. The Prime Rib was sliced thin but was very good. It was about $11.99. Then we splurged and had Fried Ice Cream. It was delicious and was accompanied by churros. It was $6.00 and there was plenty to share.

We received excellent service from Terrell. He was very friendly and helpful. He checked back often and filled our water glasses several times.

To get to the beach, you walk through the shopping area and then turn right or left.

We had read to avoid the crowds to go right. However we found the surge quite strong as we tried to enter the water especially as we were trying to navigate over the rocks. We were wearing water shoes which I think are a must.

It looked like it was better on the other side since we saw a lot of people standing in the water. The ship may have blocked some of the surge.

WOW! JUST WOW!,"I can only describe our experience at the Basilica of the Sagrada Familia as amazing. You will be saying Wow too!

The Basilica is unlike any other church you will ever see. Everywhere you look is something different. Up close you see all the carvings. It is very helpful to have a guide to explain the stories of the numerous sculptures.

Do not miss the inside. It is one of kind also. We booked our tour before arriving and I was very glad we did. We were on a cruise and other people arriving when we did were unable to get tickets for the day of arrival or the next day.

Not Much of a View if it is Foggy,"Our tour was early in the morning and it was very foggy. So we missed seeing the view. Later in the morning it started to clear off so that would probably be a better time. At least we didn't have a wait to get on the cable car.

The ride is very short which is a good thing because we were packed in like sardines!",August 2018,Gibraltar Cable Car,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187510-d4308557-Reviews-Gibraltar_Cable_Car-Gibraltar.html,Gibraltar,attractions,4.0,4.0
Great Historical Site!,"The Great Siege Tunnels are very interesting and have great historical value. It is very beneficial to have a guide.

Be aware that if you have mobility issues, it is a very steep and sometimes slippery descent and a very steep climb back up.

Interesting Historical Site!,"We started our tour of the Rock of Gibraltar by taking the Cable Car. Unfortunately it was very foggy so our view was non-existent. We saw the famous monkeys but we were not as thrilled with them as some people after we saw one jump on a ladies back. We gave them lots of room after that.

We toured the Great Siege tunnels. They are amazing and it is difficult to imagine how they were able to excavate more than 30 miles of tunnels. Not to mention what it must have been like to have to live in them.

Be aware this tour involves a lot of strenous walking. We walked around the area of the snack bar/gift shop and it had a lot of stairs. Then our bus left us off at the bottom of a steep hill we had to climb. Then in the tunnels it is a steep walk down and a very steep walk back up. We are older and we were able to do it but it was not easy. There was a lady with a cane on our tour and she made it too.

Definitely worth a visit!",August 2018,The Rock of Gibraltar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187510-d232389-Reviews-The_Rock_of_Gibraltar-Gibraltar.html,Gibraltar,attractions,5.0,4.5
More Beautiful Than We Expected!,"Of course, we had seen pictures of the Torre di Pisa but they don't really show how beautiful it is. All the individual columns and decorative elements in marble are really spectacular. It is so interesting to see how far it has sunk into the ground. Our guide told us about repairs that have been done in order to preserve it.

If you plan to climb the tower, be sure to allow plenty of time, The line was very long.

We also enjoyed shopping in the little shops surrounding the tower. We bought leather goods, a decorative mask, and a shawl at what we felt were very good prices.

Some people say the tower is not worth the time to visit, but we were very glad we did.",August 2018,Leaning Tower of Pisa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187899-d195452-Reviews-Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa-Pisa_Province_of_Pisa_Tuscany.html,"Pisa, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Italian Pizza!,"While we were at the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II in the Piazza Venezia, we wanted to eat a late lunch. We saw their display of pizzas beside the front door.

A very friendly waiter explained some of the choices. He got a table for us outside so we could enjoy the beautiful day and the view of the Monument.

We ordered a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms, basil, boiled eggs,and black olives. It was very good and about 10 Euros.

We Think it is Beautiful!,"Yes, Yes we know that the Romans consider the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II a terrible eye sore but we thought it was very impressive and beautiful!

We were near the monument several times as we walked and drove around Rome. We had to stop and look every time. There is so much detail. It also includes the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. You realize how big it is when you can hardly see the honor guard they are so tiny.

Miss the Crowds Here!,"We were walking around the area of our hotel and came across the Baths of Diocletian. It happened to be the 1st Sunday of the month so admission was free. It was the first place we visited in Rome where there were no crowds.
It is beautiful and relaxing walking around the facility. There are many sculptures and sarcophagi that you can see up close. I wanted to take the huge bathtub home.

Impressive!,"We took a Princess excursion to Avignon. We spent time inside the historic city and saw the Palais des Papes. It is a truly impressive sight.

We did not go inside but enjoyed looking at the detail on the ouside. I really felt like I was in France with the cobblestone streets and narrow alleys. We had a snack at the sidewalk café in the square in front of the Palace allowing us lots of time to study the detail.

There are lots of little shops in the area for shopping also.

A Bucket List Item Completed,"We visited the Pont du Gard aqueduct on a Princess Excursion. We have been fascinated by aqueducts since studying them in school so we were excited about the opportunity to see one close up.
Our guide gave us a lot of background on aqueducts which was very helpful. It is one of the highest and best preserved aqueducts. It is awesome to stand at the base and look up and marvel at how they were able to get those huge stones so high up. Not to mention being able to construct a bridge that has survived for 2000 years.

Great Pre-Cruise Hotel,"We booked the Hotel Hesperia Presidente through Princess Cruise Lines as part of our cruise package. Although our flight arrived at 9:00 a.m., we were able to check into our room when we arrived on our Princess transfer. After flying all night, that was wonderful!

We had contacted the concierge at the hotel prior to our arrival about arranging a tour to La Sagrada Familia Church. They replied promptly and booked it for us. Although there was a little confusion at check-in since the concierge was no longer there, it was soon sorted out and confirmed. We were very glad we had done that because people who waited to book with Princess were unable to get tickets.

Our room was very nice and modern. We were on the 14th floor with amazing views. We walked around the area and did some sightseeing and felt very safe.

An excellent breakfast buffet was included with our room. It had a wide variety of choices and the best croissants ever!

Our Favorite Tour,"The Colosseum is definitely a site not to be missed in Rome. We were fortunate to tour it at night. The lights make it so beautiful and the atmosphere is serene and eerie.
Because we went at night, there was only one other tour group so it was like we were the only ones there. After all the crowds at other attractions, we thoroughly enjoyed the quiet.
It was easy to stand there and imagine what it must have been like at the time of the gladiators. Because the floor that covered the tunnels is gone, you can see how intricately built it was.

Fabulous Tour,"We took the Colosseum and Ancient Rome Tour by night. It was fabulous. We first walked around Palatine Hill and the Forums. By then night had fallen and we entered the Colosseum.

It is difficult to express the feeling as we entered. It was dark and quiet - almost eerie. There was only one other tour group so we felt like we were the only people there.

"Great Staff, Great Rooms, Great Location","We stayed at the Best Western Premier Hotel Royal Santina during a recent stay in Rome. We booked through Princess Cruises as part of our cruise package. We were very pleased when we arrived late morning and our room was ready.
It is centrally located and near Termini Station. Walk to the nearby Diocletian Bath Museum for a very relaxed and uncrowded experience.
Our room was very modern and beautiful. I particularly liked the lights around the refrigerator and closet. You can even choose your own color. We really appreciated the free WIFI and there was even a phone in the room for free calling but we didn't use that.
We had contacted the hotel before arrival about scheduling a tour to the Vatican. They replied promptly and made reservations for us.
The front desk staff especially Iolanda was very helpful. We had asked her where to meet our tour and when they didn't arrive exactly on time, she noticed and called to verify. She always greeted us and asked about our day.
An excellent breakfast with a large variety of choices was included with our room. Water was available and sometimes snacks at the bar which we really appreciated after a long day of touring. However sometimes it was not restocked in a timely fashion.
One evening we were going to have a drink at the bar but no one was around. The next evening there was a young lady who was also the waitress for the restaurant. We waited 10-15 minutes for the drinks we had ordered.

Convenient Location,"We have stayed at the Quality Inn & Suites in Rapid City twice recently. We have been very happy with our stays. It was hot and I really appreciated the ice water in the lobby. Another pleasant surprise was complimentary water and granola bars in the room.
The 1st stay was during the summer and they were unable to give me a room with an elevator. The last time we were given a free upgrade to a suite with elevator access. If steps are a problem for you, be sure to arrange ahead of time for a room with an elevator.
We saw no maintenace issues. The pool area was nice. The breakfast had a very nice variety of choices.

Good Lunch,"Our family ate at the Overtime Steakhouse and Sports Bar for lunch. It is rather dark and dingy like a bar but the kids with us did not seem out of place. and in fact they have a children's menu.
There were 8 of us and our waitress handled our orders and food with efficiency. We ate mostly French Dip and Prime Rib Sandwiches. Our food came out quickly and piping hot. My Prime Rib Sandwich was very thinly sliced but there was lots of very flavorful meat. The prices seemed fair. The Prime Rib Sandwich was $10.99 and the French Dip about $8.99.

Cute Woodsy Decor,"We enjoyed our first trip to Mackenzie River. The décor is cute imitating the woods. I especially enjoyed the trees and the river scene.
Our waitress, Michaela was excellent. When I asked for recommendations, she was very helpful. I was concerned about how spicy the spicy chicken sandwich was. She offered to have it prepared without the Cajun seasoning. The pineapple salsa was yummy and the bacon completed it. The French Fries were a little too salty for my taste.
I don't normally review the restroom but it really bothered me that I could see fingerprints all over the walls of the stall. I don't know whether it is the type of finish or it is not being cleaned regularly. It is an issue that I believe should be addressed.

tried the Ultimate Chicken Alfredo. It was delicious. I loved the addition of broccoli, bacon and mushrooms to a traditional dish. The meal also came with breadsticks. The breadsticks were a little heavy on garlic but otherwise very good.

You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. They also bus the tables. A young man took my dirty dishes before I even left which I appreciated.
