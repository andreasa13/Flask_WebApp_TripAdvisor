Must See to Check the Box... However....,"The Black Hills is a very beautiful place and if you are in the area, heading to Mt Rushmore is a must see. However, this group tour in a very large and OLD bus was not one of our best tours. The tour company knew what they were doing but this was average at best when considering the entire experience. I would recommend just renting a car if you feel adventurous, instead of riding along with this tour.

Don't get me wrong. You can't go ""wrong"" with this tour company but perhaps there are better ways to head into the Black Hills.",September 2020,Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills Tour from Rapid City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g54774-d15681815-Mount_Rushmore_and_the_Black_Hills_Tour_from_Rapid_City-Rapid_City_South_Dakota.html,"Rapid City, South Dakota",activities,3.0,4.5
Pretty Good Pizza,"Son (15 yrs old) got a pepperoni, mushroom and anchovy pizza and ate off it for a couple of days while we were in Big Sky. He rather enjoyed it.

A Blast!!,First time whitewater rafters. Concerned about the trip’s description being a class 3 or 4 but we went in Sept with the lower water levels. They say that it is really just a 2 or 3 that time of year. It was one of the funniest things done on the trip for my 15 year old son. He and my wife both had a blast and Montana Whitewater were friendly and very organized. Would definitely recommend to also get the photo package (an additional $40 to $50 for the full package for all the action photos).,September 2020,Montana Whitewater,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45082-d1722749-Reviews-Montana_Whitewater-Big_Sky_Montana.html,"Big Sky, Montana",attractions,5.0,5.0

Very Fascinating,"This was an extra stop on our trip down from Big Sky to West Yellowstone. It was just a little bit out of the way (20 min each way). It was certainly a tragic event that took many lives during that 1959 earthquake. It was amazing to learn the history and see the power of nature.

Just OK,"We found that West Yellowstone is one of those “low service” and “over priced” places. Yes, the west entrance to Yellowstone was a convenient location and this hotel was very close to that.

First Time Fly Fishers,"Took an all day walk and wade fly fishing trip on the Gallatin River (2 adults and 1 teenager). Marcus, our guide, had a spirit of a teacher and helped us first time newbies.

"If you like history, yes go...","We were visiting relatives in the Fort Worth area and thought we would go to a museum while in town. We were surprised when we found out that there was a Civil War Museum right there in Fort Worth. Hence, we went and were glad we did. Yes, the intro movie is a bit out of date and the display halls are not grand, but man, the museum had a lot of artifacts and story boards to tell the history from both the North and South's perspectives.

Family Fun (older kids that know of Elvis),"We (family of 3) were in town visiting some friends and decided to go to Graceland for the first time. I would we say we are just ""normal"" fans of Elvis. Appreciate his music legacy (i.e. not ""mega"" fans). With that said, we had a great time at Graceland. The mansion was the least enjoyable part of the trip (but still nice). They only allowed you to walk around the first floor and basement (not upstairs). But the grounds were fun to see with his racquetball court building, stables, grave site, etc... Even more interesting was the ""Disney style"" square that they built across the street from the house. It was a series of several museums which were great to walk through the history of his music, his cars and his music legacy and then tour his airplane and then also his manager's airplane.

I would say it was a surprise local ""gem"" for us. While there, we saw that they had cave ""crawling"" tours as well (has to be scheduled in advance).

Must Go But Protect Your Belongings,"One tour guide told us that 1/2 of the people at the fountain are tourist and then the other 1/2 that look like tourist are looking to pick your pockets.

"Of Course, A Must See","This is of course a ""must see"" to visit the Colosseum when scheduling a trip to Rome. What I would add is to go ahead and arrange an official tour to skip the lines and also arrange the tour for seeing the ""underground"" of the Colosseum as well.

Add to Must See While In Rome,"While doing a walking tour to see Trevi Fountain and other areas, make sure your tour also stops at the Pantheon. Very interesting to learn about its history such as the method of construction and then its history from a pagan temple to a church. It is one of the oldest complete structures in Rome.

"Yes, What They Say Is True...","They say that Rome taxi drivers are some of the most dishonest in any major city. We found this to be true. Most will only insist on cash only (to hide profits). Got to be careful that the meter is started when getting in the taxi (not preset to too much and not not running). I have ""heard"" that you call out the cash that you give them because some will ask for ""more"" because they would claim that you didn't give them the right cash (I didn't have this issue, but I also am a rather large guy and proactively raised my voice to state the cash I was handing them). The taxis (and public transportation) were also going on ""strike"" on one of the days that we were in Rome to cripple the city (ended up not going on strike). Uber Black does work in Rome but there are not many drivers which often puts wait times typically unpractical. Overall, it was a mental and physical ""pain"" to use taxis in Rome (we walked a lot).

These three days were awesome. Warmpenguin did a great job with arranging and executing the tours. We kept the same driver for all three days and he was great input during the car travel. We also used local guides for each of the sites. I would highly recommend this because the driver is not allowed to enter the sites. We had ""Betty"" for two of the sites (Athens & Peloponnese). The amount of information that she shared was staggering and very much appreciated. We had ""Penny"" for the Delfi site. She was very much excited to share the information and engaged our 14 year old wonderfully. Overall, this was an awesome experience with the tours and the experience with WarmPengium. Would highly recommend both the tour company and the tours!!!",November 2019,"Peloponnese Highlights: Corinth Canal, Corinth, Mycenae, Nafplio, and Epidaurus",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11471515-Peloponnese_Highlights_Corinth_Canal_Corinth_Mycenae_Nafplio_and_Epidaurus-Athens_.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
"Wow, now that was great!!","Took this tour in Nov 2019 (family of 3). They mentioned that they had only been in business for about 6 months but you could not tell from the tour. The driver was great (very safe and professional). The tour guide was one of the best we had. He said call him ""ET"" if we could not say his first name. He was very knowledgeable and kept things moving. The pure number of things we saw / experienced was amazing. This was a very well planned and executed tour by a professional team. I would highly recommend!!!",November 2019,Jerusalem Boutique Tour from Tel Aviv,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g293984-d15616051-Jerusalem_Boutique_Tour_from_Tel_Aviv-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html,"Tel Aviv, Israel",activities,5.0,5.0
"Perhaps ""Young"" Startup Tour Company?","Took this tour in Nov 2019 (family of 3). The tour experience was not very ""professional"". The tour guides wore random t'shirts (not for an example a company polo or something like that). The driver was very ""aggressive"" on the roads. I actually thought we were going to run into the back of some cars (but we thankfully did not). During the trip, they were not very good on the ""schedule"". We were suppose to have 2 full hours at the Dead Sea and then it got compressed to 1 hr and 15 min and then it turned out that people were 30 min late getting back to the bus anyway. Needless to say, the ""schedule"" was not very well executed. Overall, we are very happy to have the experience but I would think like twice about booking this tour again. One positive was the one of the tour guides (bald guy, sorry that I don't recall his name). He was very nice and knowledgeable. He enjoyed his input during the tour (he didn't go to the Dead Sea part of the tour).",November 2019,Bethlehem & Dead Sea Full-Day Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g293983-d15845468-Bethlehem_Dead_Sea_Full_Day_Tour-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",activities,3.0,5.0
Tour Guide John was Awesome,"Took this tour in Oct 2019 (family of 3). We took a 3 week tour of southern Europe and John our tour guide was right up there as one of the best tour guides we had. We booked the underground Colosseum tour with the Palatine Hill and Roman Forum. The Colosseum was a must see but the background and perspective that John provided for the other stops made ""history come alive"". What a great experience and would highly recommend this tour company and ""John"" (don't think that was his actual name...)... :)",October 2019,"Ultimate Colosseum Tour, Roman Forum & Palatine Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187791-d11485315-Ultimate_Colosseum_Tour_Roman_Forum_Palatine_Hill-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",activities,5.0,5.0
Great Flexibility,Took this tour in Oct 2019 (family of 3). This was a private tour and had the flexibility to schedule it around other tours we had that day. David was the (owner / manager) who arranged the tickets and Lupe was our site tour guide. David was able to get the Sagrada Tower tour tickets which we would highly recommend in addition to the tour. And Lupe was the guide we met. She was awesome. Very interested in sharing her knowledge and patient to answer questions from our 14 year old. Would highly recommend this tour and tour company (great experience)...,October 2019,Sagrada Familia Skip-the-Line Private Tour with Guide,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187497-d16666894-Sagrada_Familia_Skip_the_Line_Private_Tour_with_Guide-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",activities,5.0,5.0
"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent...",Took this tour in Oct 2019 (family of 3). This was a 5 star experience for sure. Adrian was our tour guide and driver. He was a very good driver as well as a great tour host and guide. He worked hard to make sure that all the things my wife wanted to see were accomplished. Great experience!!

Sites & History was Awesome,"Took this tour in Oct 2019 (family of 3). I thought the main part of this trip was ""Andorra"" but we very much also enjoyed the stop in ""Baga"" and ""Axes Les Thermes"" to learn about the history of both of those locations. Andorra had great scenery. Only perhaps feedback was the ""shopping"" time in Andorra. We are more learning / history people than shopping. Our guide, Jordi, was nice and a good & even disposition...

"Long Day But Yes, Worth It","Took this tour in Oct 2019 (family of 3). There was a total of 5 people on the tour. Both the driver and tour guide were great. Our tour guide was actually from Scotland. She was very nice and accommodating (my wife is hard of hearing and would regularly make sure to turn around in the car to look at her so that she could read lips). Yes, it is a long day but wow, we very thankful to make the trip.

Local Tour Great; Bus Tour Guide Average,"Took this tour in Oct 2019. The bus tour guide (John) just did not connect with us (family of 3). As he was providing information he would ""pause"" in a way that he ""forgot"" what he was going to say next (or perhaps forget the script). It is like he was not very interested in being there. However, the local tour guide at site was very nice and helpful. Overall, we enjoyed the trip and appreciated doing it but the bus ride / tour guide was perhaps a ""3"" and the local tour was a ""5""...",October 2019,Pompeii Ruins & Mt Vesuvius Volcano Day Trip from Rome,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187791-d11449818-Pompeii_Ruins_Mt_Vesuvius_Volcano_Day_Trip_from_Rome-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",activities,4.0,4.5
Flexibility of Schedule Good; Tour Closer to Average,"Took this tour in Oct 2019. We very much appreciated the flexibility to schedule a specific time as we were arriving into the country. The tour guide in general was ""fine"" and met the tour's expectations. However, it didn't have that ""wow"" factor that you walked away and said ""now that was a good tour"" to yourself...
