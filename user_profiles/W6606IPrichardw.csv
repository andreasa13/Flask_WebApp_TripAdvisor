Probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in,"We stayed at this hotel shortly after it opened and it was amazing. The hotel used to be a palace and many of the original features have been kept. The inside of the hotel has been completed to the highest standard, the bed was very comfortable and the room was decorated very tastefully. Only problem was the downstairs bar was really quiet which made it feel a little strange.",May 2019,The One Palacio da Anunciada,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189158-d15133217-Reviews-The_One_Palacio_da_Anunciada-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",hotels,5.0,4.5

Beautiful room with a great view,Hotel was a 10min walk from the town centre and really handy for the ferry port. The room we had was on the first floor with a balcony overlooking the sea. The room itself had a 4 poster bed and an ornate high ceiling. The only thing that could have been better were the breakfasts although these were served on a great terrace overlooking the sea,October 2019,Syrou Melathron hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616163-d259732-Reviews-Syrou_Melathron_hotel-Hermoupolis_Syros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Syros, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
