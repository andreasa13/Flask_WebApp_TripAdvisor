Nice Dinner,"My colleagues and I had dinner here one night after it was recommended by our client. The service is good, you push a little bell when you want service. Staff spoke almost NO English but they did have a menu in English.
The miso soup was good. We all had the breaded, fried pork. It was tasty, but quite greasy. Prices were very reasonable. Initially we made clear with the one server who spoke English that we needed separate checks. When it was time to pay, they did not want to do this, but after some negotiation, they did. Also did not want to allow me to pay by credit card as my individual bill was less than $50. I had to insist as I did not have enough cash and they accepted it. I would recommend this place for dinner. It is a nice walk through the shopping area.",November 2019,Tonkatsu Hamakatsu Kumamoto Hamasen Baipasu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298213-d6071150-Reviews-Tonkatsu_Hamakatsu_Kumamoto_Hamasen_Baipasu-Kumamoto_Kumamoto_Prefecture_Kyushu.html,"Kumamoto, Japan",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good For Business,"I stayed here one week for business. Pros: Nice location, a lot of shopping and places to eat nearby. Breakfast was great. The room was very quiet, even when many rooms turned over and a lot of housekeeping staff on the floor. I arrived during the night and slept late. Did not hear a sound and was surprised when I left the room to see so many housekeepers working in nearby rooms. They were so quiet, much appreciated after very long flights. The room was very clean.
Cons: The bed was quite hard. Food was VERY expensive. Room service for a club sandwich and some fruit was almost $50! Two cups of tea in the lobby bar about $18. Unbelievable. This might be the reason the man in the lobby bar was very pushy that we order tea on the two evenings our team had meetings there. There is no business center and no private meeting spaces unless you pay for them. Many staff had minimal English and that posed some problems at times.
I definitely want to recognize Mr. Tsubasa Kumagawo in the lobby. This young man was very helpful to me at many times. He was kind and patient. His English was very good. This gentleman should be promoted from a bellman to a manager!",November 2019,Hotel Nikko Kumamoto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298213-d301989-Reviews-Hotel_Nikko_Kumamoto-Kumamoto_Kumamoto_Prefecture_Kyushu.html,"Kumamoto, Japan",hotels,4.0,4.5
A MA ZING,"I travel internationally for business regularly, but this was my first experience with Qatar. Wow, wow, wow. All the hype about how great this airline is, it's true. Extremely comfortable seat. Excellent food that you would be happy to pay for in a fine restaurant. The young man, Mr. Hussein who looked after me was fantastic. Very kind, friendly, attentive. He assured I was comfortable throughout this long flight. This is a first rate airline.

Quite Ordinary,"I fly internationally 4-6 times each month, always in business class. I am used to a wide range of service. Sadly, this Thai flight was quite ordinary. After a long work day, I was quite tired when the flight departed at 0130. All I wanted was a quick bite to eat and then some sleep. During the boarding process, cabin staff was totally disinterested.. After takeoff, when you might expect food service to begin, two cabin crew were comfortably seated having coffee in the galley. I had to ask for something to eat. The chicken lasagna was not very good. I don't usually have a choice about what airline I fly.

Bucket List,"If you visit Athens, you cannot miss the Acropolis. Yes, it is a bit of a walk to get to the top, but amazing when you get there.

Great Dolmadakia,"I passed by this place the day before and was a bit put off by the staff hawking to lure you in. Starving after a lot of walking, I decided to give it a try. The BEST dolmadakis EVER! I don't especially like stuffed grape leaves in the US. Clearly, the reason is we don't know how to make it. These were stuffed with meat and rice, cucumber and tomato on the side and a bit of wonderful olive oil. I nearly ordered another plate! Watching diners near me, the meat plates were huge. Don't be put off by the terribly touristy appearance.

United 53 Zurich to Dulles STINKY! DISGUSTING!,"I took this flight in late September. I connected to this flight from another very early flight so was exhausted.
Seated in Business, I put the seat down to rest even before takeoff. Immediately I smelled a horrible smell in the seat in the area you rest your head. I won't disgust you with detail, but it was horrible and the smell was pervasive, even just sitting in the seat. I complained to the cabin crew who responded that nothing could be done, Business class was full, so no other seats. It was a long and gross 8+ hour flight. United promotes their ""upgraded"" Polaris service. So disappointing! Perhaps service could start with basic cleanliness. I was not offered ANY service recovery, just a basic ""sorry"". Oh yes, and they gave me a mask to wear to avoid the smell. Sadly, it did not help at all.",September 2019,United Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729177-Reviews-United-Airlines,World,flights,3.0,3.0
Nice Hotel,"I stayed here for 6 nights for business and an additional 2 nights for holiday.
Pros: Very helpful staff. Especially want to recognize Vivi and Natali.
Room was clean, bed comfortable.
Concierge very knowledgeable.
M Lounge was acceptable, staff there very nice.
Cons: Not within walking distance of major attractions but the hotel has a free shuttle that runs to and from a central location in the city center.
Inconsistent service for refreshing the room. I had to ask for coffee to be replenished almost daily.
Breakfast was included for Titanium Elite member only in the M Lounge. Most Marriott properties invite you also to the general buffet.
I was in room 725, below the rooftop restaurant. It was not noisy except the one Saturday night I was there. I was unable to sleep until after 1 AM as there was music, chairs scraping, people talking....very loud. I mentioned this to reception staff the next morning and was told the owner had a party... sorry. Well, without choosing to do so, I had to experience the party too. Reception offered to ""buy me a drink"", what a sad comment. I had a terrible night and the service recovery is a drink? Not as expected as a Titanium Elite Member.",September 2019,Athens Marriott Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3695532-d228884-Reviews-Athens_Marriott_Hotel-Paleo_Faliro_Attica.html,"Paleo Faliro, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Brief Visits to a Number of Places,"We took this tour today. Sadly, it rained all day (surprise!) so the views were less than ideal. In any case, there are a number of stops providing a brief visit to various areas. Yes, it would have been nice to spend a bit more time in some, but it is also nice to visit different places. In Zaanse Shans, you must pay 5 Euro to actually go into the windmill, and you can watch the wheel and mechanism, and go outside on the top. We went in the first windmill (because of the rain). This windmill ground material to make color dyes for fabric and other things. It was TRULY fascinating watching the machinery, hearing the creaking sounds of it, and understanding how the windmill works as an engine. You can take photos. It was great. Also, nice hot chocolate on a chilly day. Our guide, Eduardo and driver Jan were pleasant, informative and did all possible to make the tour enjoyable. I recommend this tour. The price is also better than others. Please, give the guide and the driver a gratuity to express your appreciation. They work hard.

Freedom First Hand,"Dam Square is a vibrant area....well worth just sitting for a while. Yes, as others have said, it is congested, can be a bit trashy and there are tacky street performers. But if you look around, it doesn't take long to realize this is the City Center of a city, in a country of freedom. You see people from so many countries and cultures. It is likely some of these folks have never been in a place where people are free to express divergent ideas. You can protest, complain, speak up no matter your views about government, religion, sexual orientation or an unlimited number of opinions and causes.

Well Presented,"The history and story of the Frank family and friends was well presented and realistic. It is a bit crowded, a minor inconvenience. The Frank family felt a bit crowded as well. The 30 minute orientation program before starting is well worth the 5 euros. You learn about Anne, her family and background, also within the context of events during the period.

Great Fish,"We walked by this place the first day we were here and didn't go by again for 5 days. Finally we stopped in for a bite. The fried fish was fabulous! Great tartar sauce.

Wonderful,"We walked by this restaurant one evening and from the outside, it was charming and had so much character but we had made other dinner plans. This evening we were able to find it and went without a reservation. Fortunately it was fairly early for dinner so we were able to be seated. The place was full when we left. Ambiance is very cozy, lots of character. We love split-pea soup and I make a pretty good bowl of it. We shared the split-pea soup and it was thick, hearty and delicious. Served with wonderful brown bread that is delicious and not course. We both had the stamppot. I had the Hutspot (carrots, potatoes and meat) my husband had the daily special (lima beans, potatoes and meat).......simple ingredients but oh so delicious. Served steaming hot, we cleaned our plates. Our server, Chantal was very very nice, helpful and so polite as it seems most Dutch people are. Thank you for helping us enjoy a great dinner Chantal. There were a lot of tourists there, but really, this time of year, there are a lot of tourists everywhere in Amsterdam.

Good Business Hotel,"I stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel for one week with my team in August. Overall, a good business hotel. Pros: Very helpful staff, comfortable room, fast and reliable internet. Easy walking distance to many shops including the Shangri-La Mall, right next door. Nice selection at the breakfast buffet. Cons: Expensive at nearly $400 USD per night which did include breakfast. No private meeting space for three people, you have to pay for a conference room. Ridiculous. The dinner buffet was very nice. However, it appears that countless local families come for dinner every night. Understandable, but kids run around screaming and it is not a pleasant environment. Also, because there were SO many people eating every night, the food frequently ran out and it would take a long time, if ever, for things to be replenished.",August 2019,"Shangri-La Hotel, Ulaanbaatar",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293956-d7799662-Reviews-Shangri_La_Hotel_Ulaanbaatar-Ulaanbaatar.html,"Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Not worth the price,"We went here for dinner on the recommendation of our hotel concierge. Very disappointing and not worth the cost. Yes, the ambiance of the old houses is lovely and cozy. That is the only good thing. The food was mediocre. Our server was completely inattentive. Except for delivering our food, he came to our table only once, to deliver another 5 euro bottle of water. Did not bring additional rolls after one each. Did not check to see if everything was OK. In addition, my husband ordered a salad which he never got. It was not on the bill either, the server simply missed it completely. There are so many fabulous places to eat in Amsterdam.

Not Overrated,"When you read such outstanding reviews on TA, your expectations are high. We were fortunate on a Friday to get reservations. Just a 15 minute walk from the Tram, Graham's Kitchen is not overrated. Don't lower your expectations! The environment is cozy, service exceptional and food is amazing. I won't bore you with the details of what we ate. Every dish was a great treat. As we say in the colonies, we just wanted to lick the plates. Graham is a welcoming host who speaks with all of the guests. In a cosmopolitan city like Amsterdam with thousands of great places to eat, Graham's is a stand out. Not to be missed.

"Great Food, mediocre service","My colleague and I went to Le Chocolat near the Rotana (not downtown). We had lunch twice and dinner once. The food was really good. I had the chicken sandwich. Great, yummy fries and a nice little salad. Another time had margharita pizza, also delicious and very Italian. One of our servers, Paulo was very friendly and pleasant. The problem overall with the service is that they were unattentive. Rarely checked back with you for anything and had to get their attention for anything. I would go back for the food, but not the service. Also, terribly disappointed with the red velvet cake.

"Great Hotel, avoid Jules","I am a Titanium Marriott member so I was delighted to visit this property for the first time. My two colleagues (all female) and I stayed one night during transit through Dubai. We arrived about 5 PM and very much enjoyed the afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge which was fabulous and great service. The room was wonderful and I would love to stay there for work. We walked through the property to decide where to have dinner and settled on Jules, a Mexican place. We arrived about 8:15. The service was great, food delicious. Sadly, everything took a sour turn about 8:45. We began to notice a number of ladies congregating in the bar area, just adjacent to our table. The music started at 9 and more and more ladies arrived. They were dressed for work shall we say and all just sort of hung out and posed in the bar. Clearly these girls were working. I have traveled the world for work, staying in many countries. Rarely have I seen such a flagrant display of ""escorts"". It was really quite disgusting. I'm not a prude, but such obvious and vulgar behavior, well, we could not leave fast enough. The hotel website says about Jules that it has left ""an indelible mark on the city's nightlife scene"".....well, that is certainly true. I won't return....very disappointing Marriott. I would give this rating NO stars if possible.",June 2019,Le Meridien Dubai Hotel & Conference Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d301562-Reviews-Le_Meridien_Dubai_Hotel_Conference_Centre-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,1.0,4.5
Overall Good,"I stayed here one week for business. As a Marriott Titanium Member, I have stayed at many properties across the globe. Pros: Very nice Executive Lounge, good variety of food and beverages. Great staff in the lounge, especially want to recognize Johena and Christina who were always pleasant and helpful, even during very busy times. Breakfast buffet was awesome. Especially want to recognize Annisa who was fabulous. I appreciate staff remembering my name. The spa was lovely, and especially with a 40% discount on service. My massage therapist, Ashi was great for a relaxing 90 minute massage. My room was comfortable, bed/pillows nice. Great housekeeping service. Cons: There are insufficient electrical outlets in the room. The outlet near the desk was on the floor. Not very convenient, and my adapter would not fit. Also, no outlet for the hair dryer. I did ask for and was given an extension cord, but what a hassle, all week I had to juggle the extension cord to charge devices, dry my hair, etc. Have never quite seen this before.",May 2019,"Marriott Hotel Al Forsan, Abu Dhabi",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294013-d12185530-Reviews-Marriott_Hotel_Al_Forsan_Abu_Dhabi-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,4.5
Excellent Business Hotel,"My colleagues and I stayed here for one week of business. The hotel was excellent in many ways and I would definitely return. Staff was always friendly and helpful, nearly every one, except in the casino ( more later). Room was clean, bed and pillows comfortable. Housekeeping staff were meticulous, and always did everything the same every day. I want to recognize Ms. Noreen at Registration, we had a nice discussion and she helped give me some insight as this was my first time working in Cairo. Also REALLY want to recognize Ms. Modanna, Concierge. She helped arrange a last minute (and I mean last minute) driver and guide to the pyramids. There are numerous restaurants, I ate at Raj, Leonardos and the French rest. I enjoyed Leonardoes so much I went three times. Especially want to recognize Mr. Sammy who tends to all guests as if they were the only guest, and to server Fahemy. Breakfast buffet at Fuze was great. The gym was adequate and I had a nice massage and facial at the spa.
What I didn't like: 1. The handicapped bathroom near Fuze was filthy ( I used it twice). Sink dirty, faucet sprays all over, really gross. 2. The Executive Lounge is rather a joke. It looks like a nasty old cigar lounge. Ugly orange furniture, food terribly mediocre. The staff was nice but my colleague said they repeatedly asked him his room number during each visit, and acted like he didn't belong. and 3. The casino. I walked down there my last evening just to take a look. They wanted my passport which I did not have with me. I provided a photocopy of my passport and the lady indicated that would be fine, but it took forever and I nearly left. Finally she let me in. They only accept US dollars. I played video poker and quit when I had won $23. It took forever to collect my enormous $23. On the way out the man rudely said ""next time you need your passport"".

Nice Property,"My colleagues and I stayed here for one week for business, so we really weren't involved as vacationers. I did spend some time walking around the gardens, very nice. The beach was pretty pathetic with ugly construction on both sides. I would have been disappointed if on holiday. The breakfast buffet was good, otherwise had room service in the evening. Food was good and always pretty fast, and served hot. Hotel staff all very helpful. I am especially grateful to Mr. Aja who was both the first and last person I interacted with during my stay. I saw him often and he always had a huge smile. I did have a massage. The therapist was lovely and massage nice. The massage room is rather make-shift and you can hear people playing squash just next to the room. Not very relaxing. Overall I would return if my business takes me to Ruwais again.

I had a massage and facial at the spa with therapist Jenne. The spa is beautiful and tranquil...as a spa should be. The treatment room was comfortable and relaxing. Jenne was a great therapist. She was expert at finding tightness in my back and worked to help the muscles relax. The Exec. Lounge was great, my team of 7 had breakfast and dinner there every night. It is comfortable. A nice variety of food. There is a nice meeting room in the lounge that we reserved and used every evening. In addition to Jenne, I want to recognize Annie and Kay in the lounge.

Fabulous !,"We have visited many Caribbean islands and this was our first time to Curacao and it is now our favorite. Unlike Aruba, Curacao retains its Dutch charm and somehow manages to feel less touristy. Our 6 night stay at the Renaissance was wonderful. I am a Marriott platinum elite so we were upgraded to an ocean view room. The property is located within walking distance to countless restaurants, both very nearby and a short walk across the pontoon bridge. A treat that parking was free and just across the street.
Everything was very clean. We did the continental buffet (cold) breakfast and it was very adequate to start the day. The doughnuts with chocolate were divine! Service at breakfast was often slow, we sat outside and routinely had to go inside to ask for more coffee or something. The exception was a server named Jewella who was very attentive and has a beautiful smile. We are very grateful to the Naviagators Shakina and Reangelo (sorry if I misspelled your names). One or both of them was always available and we spoke to them nearly every day. They were very helpful in making restaurant recommendations and also made reservations for us. These two staff have perfected the guest service branded by Marriott. A suggestion for the hotel would be to keep a book of some of the restaurant menus to look at.
While on Curacao you should try to visit Cas Aboe beach. I have reviewed it seperately here on TA. When you go to Cas Aboe, schedule a massage at Sensi Spa. It is amazing-read the TA reviews for this also. Finally, there are many great places to eat and some barely mediocre and over-priced. Read the TA reviews and plan ahead as reservations are often necessary. We recommend Degaz for gelato (within walking distance) and Mosa for dinner (a few kilometer drive across the bridge. There is a nice little restaurant off the beaten path, Purunchi. Fish was great, there is no menu, they just tell you what fresh fish is available that day. Good food, but ask the price in advance. Our bill was $45 US for two fish plates and two beers. Surely they saw us coming as we later learned this is nowhere near what the locals pay.
Highly recommend the Renaissance, I know we will return.",September 2018,Renaissance Curacao Resort & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147278-d1201318-Reviews-Renaissance_Curacao_Resort_Casino-Willemstad_Curacao.html,Curaçao,hotels,5.0,4.5
Nice Evening,"We stumbled upon Fort Nassau one day while driving around lost. We walked around, the views are nice in the daytime too. When recommended by our concierge, we returned for dinner. My husband had the summer tasting menu and enjoyed it very much. I had the shrimp in garlic. Shrimp cooked properly but not much flavor, certainly not much garlic. Service very good. Great views as everyone says and nice breeze. We shared the dutch apple pie for desert and it was disappointing. Just an average piece of pie, way overpriced at $17.00.",September 2018,Fort Nassau,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147278-d1046222-Reviews-Fort_Nassau-Willemstad_Curacao.html,Curaçao,restaurants,4.0,4.5
A Nice Evening,"We did the Friday sunset cruise. Captain and staff very pleasant and entertaining. The open bar was nice. Food was very meager, don't expect ""dinner"". Food was comprised of barbeque sliders and chicken skewers. Disappointing after so many positive comments on TA about food. It was good, just not much of it, underwhelmed for $65 per person. My only other complaint was information about where to park and where to catch the boat.

Fabulous !,"We visited Mosa the last evening of our vacation. The only bad news is that we didn't go sooner, as we would have returned.
First, it is a bit difficult to find so suggest if you are driving, print a map with detail of the neighboring streets. Many of them are one-way. Second, make a reservation. We visited early on a Sunday night and by 7:30 all tables were taken. Our main server, Claudinne was fabulous. Very helpful in making selections. All staff were attentive, stopping by frequently to see if we needed anything. When you sit down you are served some pita chips and basal ailoi. Delicious, we practically licked the bowl. I had the fish civache. I love civache and order it frequently in many different restaurants. This was the BEST I've ever had. It is paired with a mango sauce that is not too sweet but a lovely complement to the fish. My husband had the tuna tartar, also very good. We then had the scallops with risotto. Again, only because we were in public, we didn't lick the plate. Scallops perfectly cooked, risotto with just the right amount of cheese. Finally we had the pork belly. It is flavored with a soy/hoison sauce, a bit too much flavor of that for me, but my husband loved it. Mosa serves truly imaginative, interesting gourmet food. The blends of flavor and texture are amazing. Presentation of all dishes was beautiful.We visited fine dining restaurants each of the six nights we were on Curacao. This far exceeded the others. Can't wait to return.",September 2018,Mosa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147278-d10260318-Reviews-Mosa-Willemstad_Curacao.html,Curaçao,restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Day,"Cas Aboe is a very beautiful beach. Entry was $3 per person, they do accept US dollars. Chair rental also $3 each. Lots of broken coral at water's edge so water booties will make it easier to get in and out of the water.

Unforgettable!,"I travel internationally for my work and get a message whenever possible. After reading such good reviews on TA, I was able to make an appointment for a body scrub and massage. Corine was wonderful. She does everything possible to assure you are comfortable. One reviewer commented on the lack of privacy, that is rediculous. Yes, there are people nearby, the sides of the hut are screened. Further, you are wearing a bathing suit and Corine assured I was never exposed. All you hear is the beautiful ocean and birds singing. You could be on a deserted island! I have chronic back muscle pain. Corine was expert at finding the tight spots and working them to relax. The pricing is very reasonable, less than at my hotel's spa. There is a reason Sensi Spa is truly the #1 in Curacao and among the BEST I have visited anywhere.

Overall Very Good,"Concierge at the Renaissance suggested this restaurant. Happy hour is half price drinks in the bar, I believe the time was 5-6 PM. Make a reservation if you want to sit on the terrace. Generally good service, a bit slow at times. For appetizers we had shrimp two ways-fantastic, and chicken salad-also very good. I had the special fish entree, tuna-nicely grilled and good flavor. My husband had trio of fish with shrimp, mahi mahi and another fish (can't recall what it was). All good except the ""other"" fish which was terribly over-cooked. The view is lovely, it is fun to watch the pontoon bridge open and close.

Best Gelato Outside Italy,"I have been to Italy many times and it isn't hard to have authentic gelato every day. I travel a lot and many times have tried ""gelato"" in many other places, always to be disappointed because I've never found gelato as good as that in Italy. Until yesterday! Walking around Willemsted, we came across Dagaz. Having just had lunch, we were ready for desert. I had no expectations for anything other than perhaps an ice cream cone. After sampling a few flavors, I settled on the Bailey's. One lick, closed my eyes and was transported to Tuscany. My husband had peanut flavor, I'm not a great fan of peanuts, and sounds weird for gelato, but it too was delicious. I was tempted to have another cone! If I hadn't been full from lunch, I would have. Glad we are here another day and will go back! Many TA reviews say this is the best gelato on Curacao. NO!!!! It is the BEST gelato outside of Italy.

Unbelievably BAD,"Pros: We went to Dal Toro for dinner. The view was awesome and nice to see and hear the waves. Cons: Pretty much everything else. The restaurant was not busy when we were there. Maybe 12 tables with diners, and there are probably 50 tables. When we first entered, a server walked right past us like we weren't there. No, someone will be with you, no welcome....nothing. Very atypical for restaurants on Curacao where the friendliness and service is usually excellent. We were seated and it was quite a while till a server took drink orders. More than 10 minutes pass, no drinks, no water, totally being ignored, we decided this was not the place for us. I spoke to the bartender telling him we were leaving and another staff member said our drinks would be right out and please stay. Our drinks finally came, and the woman brought us a basket with two cold, undertoasted, tasteless pieces of bread. Server never introduced himself and took our order. Woman came back to ask how is the bread. I said really, not very good. By the time I spoke, she was already looking away, said ok and left. She asks our opinion, but clearly is not engaged. Appetizers: bruschetta neopolitana, undercooked, boring for $12 US. Tuna tartar-fishy taste and no seasoning. Seafood pasta with aurara (pink) sauce. What can I say? The seafood in the dish (clams, muscles, squid and shrimp) were overcooked. The sauce-very sweet, and worse: it was a thick, gooey, clumpy mess. Spaghetti Bolognese- sauce in a jar at the grocery store is better. Cost without trip: $105 USD. There are unlimited restaurants in this area. My suggestion: go to Dal Toro for the view, have a drink, then go anywhere else for food. Sorry, I hate to be so critical, but I do not recommend this place,",September 2018,Dal Toro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147278-d2346360-Reviews-Dal_Toro-Willemstad_Curacao.html,Curaçao,restaurants,1.0,4.0

The food was average, below average for the price. The Puruvian civeche was the only great dish. Calamari overcooked and rubbery. Seafood combination overcooked and rubbery.

Off The Beaten Tourist Path,"Found this place on TA and also recommended by the Navigator at the Renaissance. First, it is hard to find. Find the water tanks, it is behind them on a little cove. We made a reservation for noon and it was a good thing as the place quickly filled with local people. Outdoor seating for about 15 and you definitely want to sit outdoors. I have never had fresher fish, caught that morning and watched the man clean it. Very interesting to watch his skill. I had the lionfish. Breaded and fried it was fabulous. Not greasy, perfectly cooked, fell off the bone. My husband had barracuda, also excellent. Staff is friendly and work to assure you enjoy your meal.

Fabulous,"I'm almost hesitant to write the review as I don't want this place to become so popular you can't get a table. We visited for the first time a few weeks ago. I never write a good or bad review after only one visit, so last weekend we returned with two friends.
The environment is comfortable and diners are not so close to each other you bump into people as in some restaurants. Authentic Italian cuisine. Calamari and veal marsala are among the best I've had, and I've been to Italy many times. Mushroom and sausage risotto was fabulous. Linguini with clams fabulous. Everything we had was delicious. Good selection of wines that won't make your credit card scream. Service could be a little more attentive and we had to ask for a few things more than once. Would also suggest regular Italian bread rather than the focaccia that is served. I called and made a reservation the week before, but there was no record of it. Fortunately we arrived early in the evening and were able to have a table.

A Pleasant Week,"I stayed here for business for one week. I completely agree with some TA comments about poor service. From the front desk to the housekeepers, I was always greeted with a smile and staff were willing to do whatever possible to make my stay comfortable. There were many tourists at the hotel the week I was there and breakfast was usually VERY busy. Staff worked hard to clean tables, refill coffee, and see if you needed anything. I especially want to recognize reception staff: Rachel who always had a beautiful smile, Brian, always polite and Mingky very helpful. All did what they could to meet my requests. In the restaurant, Regina was always friendly and welcoming. My only suggestions: 1. There were ants in the bathroom. They sprayed one day and there were fewer ants, but still annoying. 2. The slippers were ridiculous. Your feet extend beyond the toe and they don't stay on your feet. A waste of time to try to wear them. 3. The pillows are enormous and very hard. There are no other pillow options.

Unbelievably BAD,"It is hard to imagine the reviews on TA are actually the same place I visited today, but it is. Perhaps I should have left immediately when, after using the toilet, there was no toilet paper and no soap, not even a sink to wash your hands. My feet were washed in a bowl where I could see the grime. I thought, ok, they are just feet. Then to the message table...in cubicles with curtains and men and women next to each other. You could not see, but you could hear as the person was 10 feet away. Seriously, I don't want a massage listening to some sweaty guy moaning and groaning next to me. The minute I sat on the table I smelled an unpleasant, moldy smell. Of course, putting my head in the ""hole"" in the table intensified the nasty smell and was present through the entire massage. And the whole was like putting your face on a piece of wood. No padding and it wasn't long before that was very uncomfortable. The massage itself was below average. Really more like hard rubbing of the skin with oil. Therapist spoke no English so no way to communicate. You can't complain about the price.....about $20 for two hours. That's right- 20 and believe me, I got what I paid for. I know these are hard working people, but this place is the pits and I would NEVER return or recommend. Finally, after charging my credit card, the receptionist wanted to take a photo of my credit card! Why? Absolutely not, I told her no and she didn't.",July 2018,Tikala Shiatsu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297721-d8322266-Reviews-Tikala_Shiatsu-Manado_North_Sulawesi_Sulawesi.html,"Manado, Indonesia",attractions,1.0,4.0

Breakfast buffet was great with a large selection and very diverse. Just 10 minutes from the airport but you do not hear the planes in your room. Very important as they fly all night.

Not for a Business Traveler,"I stayed here one week for business. I stayed only because this is where my client put me. I travel internationally for business on a regular basis and know what a good hotel experience is. It is not at this place! I arrived late in the evening. The room I was given was the last room in the new wing. So VERY far to walk. I said I wanted to move closer to the lobby and was told the hotel was full but I could move the next day. So I am on the ground floor. I check out the terrace and when I went back in the room I could not lock the terrace door. I called reception. I had locked the chain on the room door. When I went to open the door, the chain was stuck and I could not get out of the room! Called reception again. It took 20 minutes for someone to come. He couldn't get the door open either. Finally, I pulled the door hard and broke the chain. I said I am not staying in this room. I waited an hour and got a new room. Lots of apologies but no service recovery. Another hotel would have sent flowers, or wine or something as an apology.
The breakfast and dinner buffets were nice but SO crowded in the evening you could hardly find a table. Of course, this is a vacation hotel so lots of families. They just let their kids run all over the place yelling. Kids picking food off the buffet and then returning it. So gross.
Room service was prompt. Pizza was awful, spaghetti good.
Our client reserved the rooms, and they were to be upgraded. When my colleague checked in they told him it was not a nice room and for $15 a night they could upgrade him! My other colleague-on Saturday, our free day, plumbers were working in his bathroom for 4 hours!
I had a massage in the hotel spa. It was also terrible. The technician used some stinky oil that smelled like medicine, like camphor. And SO much oil. Disgusting. She did not use any pressure in the massage. When I asked her for more pressure she did so for about 2 minutes. What a waste of money.

Simply Awful,"We used to enjoy McMahons but haven't been in about 5 years. Four of us went for dinner and it was simply awful. Environmentally it looks like a place that nobody cares about. Dirty windows, dirty light fixtures, ugly curtains that do not screen the empty parts of the dining room where chairs are stacked on tables, making the place seem closed. Even worse, the food. OMG. One of us had the steak stew. It looked like dog food in a pastry puff. Horrible taste and way over-salted. Corned beef and cabbage (a ""specialty"") was inedible. Literally my Dad ate one bite and no more. Fish and chips-soggy, no taste. Service also lacking. Never came back to check after food was delivered. Had to go to the bar to ask for the check. And the server didn't think it was odd that we had nearly full plates paying the check and DIDN't want to go boxes. Never inquired if the meal was OK. I wanted to complain but my husband stopped me. What's the use? We simply will never go back. The Guiness was good. Otherwise $70 wasted.

A Wee Bit Disappointing,"First of all, it is not easy to make advance reservations online. In the US, weeks in advance I tried. My credit card that I use internationally o a regular basis was rejected for no apparent reason. Then I was referred to a booking agent who told me they don't accept reservations for parties less than 8, which is totally not true. My colleague was finally able to book the reservation and we were excited. The Pro's: The story teller, Helena was engaging and delightful. The food was good, but certainly not any better than you could find at most any pub in Dublin, and for much less money. The building is interesting and it is cool to be in a pub that old. The Con's: They pack, and I mean pack the tables and chairs so close you can barely move. The meal comes in courses and the storytelling comes in between. While you are eating there is no story telling. Rather, the room is SO crowded, once people start talking the sound is deafening and you can barely have a conversation with the person next to you. You sit at tables family style so the three of us were at a table with strangers. Not a problem. But if you have drinks, the server brings your check. Our checks got all mixed up with the other people's and it was quite a challenge to sort out. If you want to put this on your ""been there/done that"" list, give it a try.

The good: Bloody Mary's average. Clam chowder good. Fried clam strips appetizer like frozen in the grocery store.
The bad: Decor is childish. As others have noted, the chairs are like for elementary school. Our server was pleasant but had no idea what she was doing. We had to ask 3 times for a straw and finally were given swizzle sticks! Appetizers came to the table and in less than 2 minutes, entrees arrived. I mentioned this to the server who said, the kitchen is working really fast tonight. Well that's good....but not the point of an appetizer. Entrees-soft-shell crabs, cooked perfectly but NO taste. Fried oysters essentially the same. There is a lot of restaurant competition in this area today. I will be surprised if this place lasts through the end of the year.
