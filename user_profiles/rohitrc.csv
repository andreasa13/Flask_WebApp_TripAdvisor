Good for a leisurely lunch,"We went for lunch on a weekend. There was parking available. The restaurant is on the 4th floor. The place was less than half filled. We decided to go for the buffet lunch on table option.
The menu is available below in the pictures. The spread is good, for both veg and non-veg options. There’s the soup, three starters, three curries in the main, all roti/ naan options, biryanis, noodles, etc and lastly three desserts.
The food was tasty in general. The quantity is good and you might just stick to the first serving unless you really like a particular dish. Amongst starters the fish was good. The only dish I was disappointed with was the mutton rogan josh. It was bad. If I had go for the a la carte then I wouldn’t risk the mutton dishes.
The people are good but keep in mind that service is slow, hence the leisurely lunch!",February 2020,Indian Foodies Hub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297586-d15067036-Reviews-Indian_Foodies_Hub-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html,"Hyderabad, India",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Intricate carvings and architecture!!,"The Sun temple is a must visit if you’re in Bhubaneswar/ Puri / Chilika zone.
It’s a monument and not a functioning temple.
There were three structures out of which the largest has almost completely broken down so the middle one can be seen, and it is quite a huge structure at 100 feet. It was higher than that at some point of time when it was built in the 13th century.
The entry ticket is Rs 40 and it takes about an hour if you want to do a quick round of the ruins. It is advisable to hire a guide for about Rs 250 to see the main points and understand the intricate carvings, architecture and history.
There’s a Yatri Nivas a couple hundred meters from the site, where you can park your car, refresh and walk to the temple. That’s almost where all vehicles need to stop and you need to proceed by walk.
TIP: The Yatri Nivas can help give a pass for vehicles if you have someone who cannot walk.
It’s sad to see the stone carvings slowly eroding.

"Good food, accommodation & ambience!!","We were there for a night while visiting Puri and Konark.

The room was big with a sofa cum bed big enough for a third guest/kid/adult. The room were very neat clean and well maintained. The bathroom was good, hot water etc. Wifi is available on payment.
The dinner was at their restaurant which serves buffet and alacarte. We went in for the buffet as it was a very impressive spread of largely Indian and a few Chinese/ Italian dishes. The breakfast was also at the same place and the spread was equally good. South /North Indian spread plus live counter for dosa, eggs etc.

Loved the pasta al forno!!,"This place is at the end of the lane adjacent Neerus near Madhapur. There’s valet service. We went for dinner on a weekday.

We were a family and friends group of 6. Ordered a couple of pizzas, pastas and lasagne.
The pizzas are 10” - 8 slice ones. We Iiked the chicken pizza - Straniera, and the vegetarian- pizza margherita. Thin crust, with good amount of cheese and cottage cheese cubes. Tasted good!

Sizzling joint for sizzlers!,"At 9 pm on a weekday the place was reasonably full. Families, couples, friends seemed to be enjoying the sizzlers.

The ambience is good, warm. The service is good, warm and reasonably fast.
Both the sizzlers were very good, meeting expectations! You can opt for noodles or rice. The veg paneer sizzler was the Chinese style. The mixed grill comes with a fried egg. No frills.

The chicken curry and urad daal were excellent. Not spicy. But you can get onions and mirchi complementary. The portions are big. One curry and naan or rice is good for two people. Naan comes in four pieces.
