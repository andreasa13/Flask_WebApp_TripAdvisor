Bedern Hall Garden,"We were very excited to visit again once outdoor dining was allowed and booked a table in the Bedern Hall garden that Ambiente are using at the moment to provide outdoor seating. Such a pretty location, nice and quiet, tables well spaced. The staff were very welcoming and I has contacted them earlier in the day for help meeting some dietary requirements which were accommodated with no fuss. We brought our 13 year old son and our daughter celebrating her 11th birthday - both had been asking when we could go back! It's a restricted but well balanced menu. Bit of a wait for food as they were bringing it from the Goodramgate kitchen but we have to understand the challenges businesses are currently facing. They had a little kitchen where they're serving drinks from (again q limited selection but enough choice) and our suggestion would be to perhaps serve olives, bread etc from there to put people on while waiting for other food. The food was excellent and we had a lovely evening. We will be back soon.",April 2021,Ambiente Tapas Goodramgate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186346-d1056603-Reviews-Ambiente_Tapas_Goodramgate-York_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"York, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Lovely family meal,"We were in Penrith just before the recent tier change to help vulnerable relatives and as our hotel was not serving food needed somewhere to eat. A quick trip advisor check located this place that looked like all 4 members of our family (including a teen, tween and gluten free me!) would be able to eat something we enjoyed. It really exceeded our expectations and we had a lovely evening. A warm welcome, by the book covid measures and excellent food, including clearly identified gluten free options. We all enjoyed our pizzas, which we could see being made fresh to order in the open kitchen and pizza oven. There was a far greater selection of gluten free desserts than is normal too. We hope to visit again with our wider family when we are able to do so.",December 2020,Woodstone Pizza & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186328-d14990813-Reviews-Woodstone_Pizza_Grill-Penrith_Eden_District_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Penrith, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Gorgeous Boxing Day Walk,"By the time I thought on to book tickets for a Boxing Day treat, there were only slots after 3pm left but I thought it would be nice to see the Abbey at dusk and was hopeful it would be lit up. I was not disappointed! The weather forecast wasn't great with a storm brewing but we decided to chance it. It was quite light when we arrived on the dot of 3pm so we had a beautiful winter walk on the well made paths. We've been before but if you haven't, the route finding is very easy. On the way back towards the Abbey and car park it got properly dark and we were able to enjoy the stunning lights and piped choral Christmas carols inside the ruins. Absolutely stunning. Cafes and loos were all open as was the shop, and lots of friendly staff around. Highly recommend.",December 2020,Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal Water Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g209973-d211827-Reviews-Fountains_Abbey_and_Studley_Royal_Water_Garden-Ripon_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Ripon, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Excellent, a little corner of Sicily","Adding our voice to the other reviewers who loved this place. We spotted it on a wander round Swanage the dat after we arrived and messaged to book a table for a few days later. The staff were lovely and welcoming. The ambience - reminded us so much of places we've eaten in Italy, Greece and Portugal. Small, intimate, Italian music. We started with a fabulous sharing board of meats, cheeses, olives and salad then moved onto pastas and pizzas. I'm gluten free and loved the lentil pasta option and choice of authentic sicillian sauces, a bit different to the norm. Husband and I shared an excellent bottle of nero d'avola and we all finished up with various flavours of excellent gelato. We felt the bill was very reasonable for the quality of both food and overall experience - £95 for 3 courses for 4 people and wine/fresh fruit juice. I wish we were here longer and could go again!",October 2020,Peppina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186266-d17705268-Reviews-Peppina-Swanage_Isle_of_Purbeck_Dorset_England.html,"Swanage, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Beautiful,"This was just beautiful! It was one of the main reasons I wanted to visit this area. We drove past it on our way to our accommodation in Swanage and I was very excited having booked tickets for the following morning. We are NT members so no additional charge. We had opening time tickets at 10am and having read the reviews arrived a little early for the walk round, which took about 15 minutes. Easy to park at that time, car park full by lunchtime in half term though. The walk was lovely, by a river round the bottom of the castle, and gave a sense of anticipation as we approached. Really friendly staff at the gate, explained everything to us and pointed out kids activities. We thoroughly enjoyed a scramble around the ruins with airy views over the Isle of Purbeck to Poole Harbour. Nice and quiet as we were first up. Quite a lot of people heading up as we headed down again. Some good info boards near the entrance. The visit took about an hour, perfect timing for a coffee and cake in the tearoom just outside then a quick nosey round the village and a walk onto a small hill next to the castle with fabulous views, see pictures.",October 2020,Corfe Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551710-d261348-Reviews-Corfe_Castle-Corfe_Castle_Isle_of_Purbeck_Dorset_England.html,"Corfe Castle, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Lovely half day walk,"We really enjoyed our visit today. We parked at Durdle Door and walked down to the beach there, then back up and along to Lulworth cove, back to the car park via a path set back from the cliff that wasn't as steep and was very quiet. Parking was easy and we didn't object to the fees. £5 for 4 hours is plenty of time. We didn't find any part of the walk in the least bit strenuous and neither did our 10 and 13 year old. Lots of cute little kids in wellies seemed to be fine too! The path is wide and well maintained so as long as you have footwear with decent grip - good trainers or boots, or trek sandals - you'd be fine. We did see one guy in flip flops! Not advisable but he seemed ok... An earlier review commented on the steps being dangerous which they aren't at all. It's obviously busy - if you visit there you are contributing to that and can't really complain! And it's obvious why so many visit, it's stunning and makes a very pleasant half day excursion. We ate our picnic on the beach at Lulworth Cove and enjoyed an ice cream before walking back. If you go with the right expectations you'll be just fine - it's a coastal walk, not a slick tourist attraction/theme park, dress accordingly, pace yourself a bit if you need to, expect to see a number of other people, and mostly just enjoy it!",October 2020,Lulworth Cove and Durdle Door,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1420384-d546417-Reviews-Lulworth_Cove_and_Durdle_Door-West_Lulworth_Dorset_England.html,"West Lulworth, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fascinating stop off,"Like many people we stopped off here on our way to the south west. We're National Trust members so we're able to get in ""free"" as part of our membership, happy days. We booked the earliest slot, 9.30am, and it was lovely and quiet, hardly anyone there! We enjoyed the walk over to the stones, nice to get some fresh air, and there was a lovely sense of anticipation. We decided to head straight there and look at the visitor centre after, to enjoy the stones in relative quiet before more people arrived. The stones themselves are incredible and we felt we could get close enough. It was very wet and our daughter was cold by the time we'd done that so we hopped on the shuttle bus back to the visitor centre which was not busy and had a nice chap making sure social distance was maintained - in fact all the staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful, and most of them were getting wet! We popped in the cafe for hot drinks, again not too busy, then looked at the exhibition which we thought was excellent and really helped us make sense of what we'd seen. Car park was full by the time we left around 12.30 so glad we got there early!",October 2020,Stonehenge Family Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g528762-d13232302-Stonehenge_Family_Ticket-Amesbury_Wiltshire_England.html,"Amesbury, United Kingdom",activities,5.0,4.5
Favourite day out,"My son and I have visited regularly for a few years now and love our days out there. It started when he was younger just watching the planes, having a run around and playing in the playground. He has caught the plane spotting bug and we visited today with his new video camera and tripod to film some of his favourite aircraft. Pouring with rain but we hunkered under our brolly and made the best of it! I thankfully had the foresight to book a technical tour of Concorde which was fantastic and kept us dry for 90 minutes - which felt like 10! We love the cafe too though my son refuses to go in as it keeps him away from the planes so we got sandwiches to take out. Staff always friendly.",October 2020,The Runway Visitor Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g9783973-d2170121-Reviews-The_Runway_Visitor_Park-Ringway_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Ringway, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
Quick drink!,"My brother and I popped in for a quick drink on the way from Preston Park area to the station. It wasn't busy, test and trace book and sanitiser out on a table (though no one enforcing use!) Tables well separated and one person per group at the bar. Brother was paying so he took their recommendation for a glass of white wine for me which was very good, sauv blanc I think, and he had a pint of a local beer. Very pleasant.",September 2020,Hare and Hounds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d6522330-Reviews-Hare_and_Hounds-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html,"Brighton, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.0
"Perfect, thank you!","Just got back to my hotel after my meal at Tinto Taperia. There's a little story ;) we visited as a family back in February before the lockdown when we were in town to visit my grandmother. We loved it, and sadly my grandmother passed away a couple of weeks ago so when I returned to Brighton on my own today for her funeral it was an obvious choice. Due to covid restrictions my husband and kids couldn't come with me and we couldn't have a family gathering afterwards. I hadn't felt like eating earlier in the day so I was ravenous. I was made welcome and did not feel at all uncomfortable on my own. I demolished gambas pilpil, tortilla and espinicas followed by tarta de Santiago all washed down with a glass of temperanillo rosado and it was just what the doctor ordered. I'm gluten free and it's still fairly unusual to be able to enjoy such an extensive menu, and especially a dessert that doesn't feel like an afterthought. We will be back in Brighton soon and will be sure to eat here. Thank you so much.",September 2020,Tinto Taperia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d14173496-Reviews-Tinto_Taperia-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html,"Brighton, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Overstretched staff doing their best...,"A difficult one to decide between 3 and 4 stars. I decided to err on the side of generosity. The staff were lovely and the food was good. We were warned service may be a little slow. It took about 20 mins to take our order and after 45 mins our drinks hadn't arrived. We'd ordered G&Ts and aperol spritz to drink as an aperitif while waiting for our mains and a bottle of red to go with our steak. The manager noticed our drinks hadn't come and kindly offered 20% off our bill which was welcome but frustrating - for the sake of bringing us a quick drink we'd have been much more relaxed about waiting for our food and would have saved a dent in their profits. The aperitifs, wine and food all arrived at the same time! We decided to drink our wine with the main and save the other drinks for with dessert and that worked well! Our steak was beautifully cooked and I appreciated being able to swap my chips for veggies. Blackcurrant mousse cake for dessert was delicious. By the time we left at 9.30 the place was empty so service improved for getting dessert. The young woman who served us was lovely and clearly completely overstretched. They just need to look at staffing levels for the number of bookings they're taking and this would have been excellent.",September 2020,The Katarina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d1490722-Reviews-The_Katarina-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html,"Brighton, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.0
A garden of one's own...,"Wow. I assumed we were, as at many places, booking a restricted numbers timed slot to visit the gardens (House closed at present). We arrived, no one there... I started to panic that we were in the wrong place... a chap came out and showed us to the walled garden area explaining that what we had in fact booked was to have this gorgeous garden completely to ourselves for 2 hours! An unexpected treat and a real highlight of our short break in Sussex. When we'd finished we walked up onto Firle beacon then back down into the village.

Lovely Nymans,"Ahh Nymans. One of our favourite places. We always call in when visiting family in the area. Often we don't have long and really appreciate an hour or so leg stretch and a cuppa. This time we had longer so after ambling around the covid-friendly one way system, enjoying an ice cream from a little van part way round, we headed out the side of the overflow car park and followed a waymarked woodland walk, absolutely lovely.",September 2020,Nymans Gardens and House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g504221-d2641575-Reviews-Nymans_Gardens_and_House-Haywards_Heath_West_Sussex_England.html,"Haywards Heath, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Exceeded expectations,"We booked our entry time for 11am thinking we would have a wander and a picnic, maybe spending a couple of hours here but in the end didn't leave until 5 hours later! There are 2 separate garden areas, at the moment with a one way system. A fabulous area where kids are encouraged to play at den making etc- my 10 and 12 year old spent a good half hour on that! We then followed one of the marked walks around the estate, followed by ice cream in the pretty outside seating area at the cafe. When we passed earlier in the day there was quite a long queue to enter the house (ground floor only now open) but later on it was empty so we popped in, absolutely stunning and some fascinating snippets of info from the volunteers in each room. Husband bought plants in the shop which always makes him happy! A great day out for us all, would highly recommend.",September 2020,Standen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g499616-d2236601-Reviews-Standen-East_Grinstead_West_Sussex_England.html,"East Grinstead, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Too busy,"We are RHS members but live near Harlow Carr so we like to call in at Wisley when visiting family on the south coast. It's a beautiful garden and we enjoy seeing it in different seasons. A few new things since we were last here 2 years ago, interesting to see. We visited on Bank Holiday Monday and I have to say for the present circumstances it was far too busy. We expected it to be quieter than usual but it really wasn't. Social distancing was impossible in some areas and very difficult in others though it is possible to get away from people in quieter areas. We were standing 2m behind the people in front in the entry queue (on markers on the floor) and a couple just wandered into the space and pushed in the queue in front of us which was annoying and they clearly had no regard for the requirements, the queue could do with staff keeping an eye on it and likewise in the more popular areas of the garden such as near the lakes, rose garden, tropical garden... Overall though still a very enjoyable visit and we will of course be back.

Top tapas,"Our family of four visited here on a Sunday evening. Definitley book ahead, it's small and very popular. We enjoyed a really good selection of tapas that made us feel like we were on holiday in Spain despite Storm Dennis battering Brighton outside! The portions are generous, we ordered a couple of dishes too many, but they were all so good it was ok with us as it meant we got to try more things. Highly recommended.",February 2020,Tinto Taperia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d14173496-Reviews-Tinto_Taperia-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html,"Brighton, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Really good family meal,"We ummed and ahhed a bit about going here based on some of the reviews (especially about rude staff!) but we rightly decided to look at the majority of reviews that were very positive. Perhaps because of Storm Dennis, we were able to walk in on a Saturday evening around 7pm and be seated straight away, though it did get very busy from then. It's noisy, bustling and definitely not a place for a romantic dinner for two, but great for a family meal with kids and there were lots of big parties in there, family groups, birthday parties etc. We all had a pizza (I was delighted to be able to get a gluten free base, they also do gluten free pasta), three desserts between the four of us, fruit juices for the kids and a bottle of wine for my husband and I. The bill came to about £70 including service (added to the bill, which we found to be common practice in Brighton, 10%) which isn't much more than it costs the four of us to go to McDonald's by the time the kids have eaten two of everything, and was much nicer experience! All the members of staff we dealt with were polite and efficient.

Attractive but busy...,"I wasn't sure how to rate this, as obviously the site itself is spectacular, the location is stunning and the views are to die for. The Gaudi architecture is fascinating, our kids loved it, it's like a fantasy land. We stopped for coffee and snacks at the café down near the gate lodges and the staff there were fabulous, efficient, lively. The Bus Guell was a great way to get there and back from Alfons X metro, absolutely no hassle, no queue, no waiting around; we arrived about 15 mins early for our ticketed time but were allowed to enter the ticketed area right away, very friendly welcoming staff. What takes it down a notch is that it is far too busy, in some areas you could hardly move. In addition to that, the place is full of people taking selfies and photos for Instagram, walking backwards, trying umpteen times for the perfect shot during which time they expect you to wait before walking by, stopping in the middle of the path to touch up make up so they are picture perfect, hanging off and sitting on the various decorative columns and ornamental features. They are totally in the way and not interested in capturing memories, only in how many likes and follows they will get, presumably in some cases for commercial purposes. We found it quite depressing and it made us reflect more on our trip to Athens earlier this year. At most major sites there you're not allowed to take selfies, take photos of people next to statues and other artefacts, or pose for photos. This is strictly enforced by people with whistles and at the time we thought it was a bit OTT but our experience here made us revise that, something needs to be done so that people can still take photos to enjoy their holiday memories without affecting the enjoyment of others. Overall though this is a must-visit especially if it's your first time in Barcelona (we'd been before but the kids haven't) and it was lovely to be outdoors taking in the views on a glorious sunny day.",January 2020,Parc Guell,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190624-Reviews-Parc_Guell-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great family meal,"We're a family of 4 with kids aged 9 and 12, and were staying on the next street to this restaurant. Despite being in Spain, Italian food works well for us as a family as there is always something the kids, especially the youngest, will enjoy, so having checked the reviews this combination of food and location seemed perfect. I also read on another review that you could have ""everything gluten free"" which appealed as I am GF - I really think this restaurant could make more of that. The menu said to let them know if you had dietary requirements but didn't specifically mention they had GF options. I asked for a steak as that's usually a safe bet but was told they'd sold out so that was when I asked for help to choose something suitable and was told any pata or pizza was available gluten free - happy days! The lovely waitress suggested the pizza of the day, which was perfect, and also helped my husband and I choose a very good bottle of wine (we weren't sure whether to go Spanish or Italian). We shared starters - mozzarella and tomato salad and carpaccio of beef with parmesan and rocket; the kids each had pasta dishes and my husband and I had pizzas. The kids obviously wanted dessert, and as they didn't have what my daughter wanted they offered a chocolate cake with ice cream free of charge. Overall the food and service were excellent. Not the cheapest option (E110 for the 4 of us, 2 starters, 4 mains, 3 desserts, 2 apple juices and a bottle of good wine) but we were happy with the price:quality ratio and had a lovely evening. Would recommend making a trip here if you are gluten free.",January 2020,Tuscania Food and Wine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d4004735-Reviews-Tuscania_Food_and_Wine-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
We loved it,"We booked fairly late so there were only 2 apartments remaining, the apartment suite in the main building, or apartment 6 which is the only one in a neighbouring building (all the others are in the same building). We opted for apartment 6, which is on floor 4 and was perfect for us. This building has a lift which the main building doesn't, we were really grateful for this after a lot of walking around the city. The roof terrace is on the top of the other building, but this didn't bother us as we had a fabulous view from our apartment anyway and in January there was less need to sit outside. It was nice though to open our patio door with view onto Sagrada Familia. As we are a family of 4 with 2 kids, we really appreciated the space - 2 bedrooms, one double one twin, and lots of comfy living space. The view meant we could relax at the apartment and eat in while still feeling we were very much in the city. There are good restaurants, bars and cafes nearby - we ate a good meal at Tuscania restuarant, Italian food being great for the kids although in Spain! Carrefour supermarket a couple of mins walk away had everything we needed for breakfast and lunch and a couple of evening meals in as well. Metro stop also 2 mins walk, so easy to get from the airport to the apartment and travel around the town but the area was quiet and being a few floors up from the hustle and bustle felt like a nice escape after visiting busier sites.

So good we went twice!,"This is a gorgeous family run taverna in a pretty little village that just so happened to be walking distance from our villa, and was recommended by the owners. We were lucky with the weather, last week of October, so were able to take advantage of the tables on the terrace among the trees. The menu is on a blackboard, English version available, and the owner and staff speak fluent English. We selected a few things from the menu, and both times had more than we could eat for around E50 for a family of 4 including drinks (fresh orange for the kids, house wine for the adults). Dishes we sampled included a lovely fresh Greek salad, giant beans in tomato sauce, stuffed courgette flowers, pork with rosemary, a traditional pork stew, large grilled shrimps and local sausages. My daughter loved the custard pie and the rest of us had a scoop of ice cream - it was nice to be able to just have a little something sweet at the end of the meal. Beware the free raki that comes after the meal - the first night we had extra wine but the second time we refrained in anticipation! The raki comes with a lovely plate of Turkish delight.

Great experience,"Well, we usually fly with budget airlines such as Ryanair and Jet2, so this was a real treat! The only things slightly annoying: we were asked to check our hand luggage at the gate - I spent a lot of time making sure it was the correct weight etc - but as the cabin was full they were looking for cases to book in. Hey ho. It then took quite a while for them to emerge at Manchester which was a bit tedious but not the end of the world. Then the wifi on board didn't really work which was a shame. On board however - great experience! We boarded first due to travelling with children - they are 9 and 12 so we really don't expect (or usually get!) this any more but it was good to get them settled in earlier. Crew really welcoming. Leg room! Half as much again as we are used to on our usual flights. Delicious breakfast - omlette, fruit, bread/jam and biscuits, great coffee and my son appreciated the fresh orange juice. I pre-ordered gluten free, special meals were brought first and they knew where to bring them, no fuss. Really appreciated. A couple of extra services for drinks as well. Little video screens showing where we were, I love to know where I am! We took off a little late but arrived more or less on time. I would proactively look to fly with this airline again.

Exceeded expectations,"After reading the reviews I was a bit worried about this, but we had a really good experience. We checked in 4 bags (one each) and skipped onto the plane with our small handbags. Boarding was easy, crew were friendly. Plane took off a little late - maybe 20 mins? But landed more or less on time. Crew scooted up and down serving water, juice, coffee and biscuits. Didn't wait too long for our bags in Athens - maybe 30 mins from landing, just had time to have a quick look in the shops and pick up a bottle of prosecco to enjoy when we arrived at our hotel.

Relaxed lunch away from crowds,"A friend recommended this place for lunch on a day trip into Chania last week. We were glad we asked for a recommendation as the restaurants by the harbour were quite touristy, with people trying to get you to go in, so it was good to have somewhere to aim for. Tamam has a few tables on the narrow winding old town street, then on one side of the road in the old Turkish bath house and a more modern part on the other side. We opted to sit outside as it was a glorious day. We were first to arrive at 12.30pm but the outdoor tables soon filled up. Service was relaxed and friendly. We chose a couple of starters to share (2 adults, 2 kids) then a main each which was a perfect quantity. The white wine was so nice I ordered a second glass not aware there would be complimentary raki alongside the complimentary desert (halva - delicious!) so I was a bit tipsy when we left! My fussy 9 year old daughter loved her pasta in tomato sauce and ate all of it even though it was a huge portion! I had sea bass, my son calamari and husband boureki. All were excellent I'm coming back to the area with friends net year and wouldn't hesitate to return here, and in the meantime I have a copy of their recipe book to see me through the dark British winter!",October 2019,Tamam Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d1104362-Reviews-Tamam_Restaurant-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
