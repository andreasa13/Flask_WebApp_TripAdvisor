"Such authentic dishes from Bali, Indonesia, Vietnam & more","For our first trip to Barcelona after many months, we wanted lunch in El Ravel to celebrate & were attracted by the great reviews. We sat outside in the sunshine and loved our choice of menu. There is not a huge choice but each one was so tasty and yes, we asked for the piquant option which is still quite mild for those not too keen on chilli.

Great lunch stop for delicious grilled meat,"Choose from a great choice of dishes here cooked well on the grill, including lots of speciality sausages. There's lots of outside space, although when we visited it was on the chilly side and we huddled around the wood burning stove. I am sure it will be excellent in the Summer.

Fine dining with a South American twist on the Costa Brava,"I have been following this restaurant since it opened, living close to Palamos, but never having the time to visit. The sad reduction in tourist visitors this summer meant that there was a chance for locals to enjoy this wonderful experience on a Sunday in August! Thoroughly enjoyed the combination of two cultures and the maitre d was welcoming and informative.

A beautiful gallery space but the erotic nude exhibition was not to my taste,"I have never complained about an exhibition before, but I did when visiting the Frissiras Museum. I love modern art and certainly am not averse to the adult female nude but there were several exhibits in the Love is a Dog from Hell exhibition that I believe should have been censored where young teenage girls were presented as sexual objects.

Once in a lifetime experienc to see big cats in the wild,"My friends and I stayed 3 days in the area and went on a total of 5 safaris, two of them on the water and 3 by jeep. It should be stressed to those visiting just once, that animals are in the wild, not tagged in anyway, so it is very much down to luck what and how many animals and birds you see. The guides talk to each other by radio when there is an important sighting, but then there is a big jumble of jeeps and buses rush to the area so visibility is reduced. The length of time the enthusiastic amateur photographers require to take the perfect shot is also frustrating.

Service was eratic to say the least, probably because the staff did not always understand English but also because the food arrived in any order and in any combination.

Many of the staff are extremely friendly, the night watchman was a lovely man and took me on a walk to the nearby tea plantation, but others can barely speak English and it is a bit of a lottery if you get what you asked for at the time you asked for it!

I enjoyed a walk around this whole area of the city.",January 2020,Hawa Mahal - Palace of Wind,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304555-d317345-Reviews-Hawa_Mahal_Palace_of_Wind-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jaipur, India",attractions,5.0,4.0
The best hotel we stayed in India,"The rooms are so beautifully decorated, the restaurant is excellent and the staff are all so helpful and friendly. I unfortunately was ill when I arrived here and they kindly arranged for me to move to a quiet room where they kept an eye on me to make sure all was well. I would recommend to anyone visiting Jaipur",January 2020,Umaid Bhawan Heritage House Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d472632-Reviews-Umaid_Bhawan_Heritage_House_Hotel-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jaipur, India",hotels,5.0,4.5
Grand proportions & open gardens make this a relaxing oasis,"This garden tomb precedes the Taj Mahal and although is not as lush with decoration, a visit is important as an early example of this type of Murghal architecture.

Wonderful place to start our journey in India,There was a lovely welcome waiting for us with drinks and flowers and the rooms were very comfortable.

So much to see here before you visit the Taj,"Sadly the Agra Fort and its palaces does not have huge write ups in guide books as everyone rushes to the Taj Mahal, but on the opposite bank of the river Yamuna, there is so much to see. Take your first view of the Taj from the palace where its builder Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his son so that he could look to his wife's tomb each day! There are palaces, barracks and lots of monkeys.",January 2020,Agra Fort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297683-d319695-Reviews-Agra_Fort-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,"Agra, India",attractions,5.0,4.5
this marble perfection brought tears to my eyes,"This is a stunning building and don't believe all you read that you must be there for sunrise to see a pink hue on the building! I went on a very cold, wintry day and silver light made the visit quite etheral. Of course the cold also meant there were far less visitors than normal so we were able to enjoy all the parts of the site in comforatable splendour. Just beautiful.",January 2020,Taj Mahal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297683-d317329-Reviews-Taj_Mahal-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,"Agra, India",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Friendly, helpful staff and a food choice of dishes","We were a little nervous as we descended into a celler area with an abanadoned restaurant above, but once inside we were given a warm welcome and the place was attractive. The staff were friendly and efficient, most importantly the food tasted very fresh and fragrant. The different naan breads were excellent.",January 2020,Haveli Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297683-d6407152-Reviews-Haveli_Restaurant-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,"Agra, India",restaurants,5.0,3.5
A comfortable restaurant with great food,"On the day we visited for an excellent lunch there seemed to be an excessive number of staff, with several managers dictating from the side lines. It was a little overwhelming, but none the less a good choice of excellent dishes served quickly which was appreciated as we were on a tour.",January 2020,Culinary Junction By Udupi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297683-d15183170-Reviews-Culinary_Junction_By_Udupi-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,"Agra, India",restaurants,4.0,5.0
"Great seafood, easy to park midweek and right by the sea","After picking someone up at the airport, I called in at Port Olympic for a little R&R by the seaside before making my way home. A great mojito whilst waiting for the table on a busy holiday Monday. My calamari was excellent hence the rating, but the children's pasta was very disappointing, sweet and gluey. I told the waiter, kids like good food too!

"peaceful way to spend an afternoon exploring independent shops, eateries and beautiful buildings","I can't believe it has taken me 20 years to get to the Gracia district of Barcelona! It has the peaceful atmosphere of a small town with lots of interesting independent shops, bars and restaurants to explore. A slow walk down Carrer de Verdi is a must, Casa Vicens is amazing and look to the roof tops for many more beautiful Modernist buildings.",December 2019,Barri de Gracia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d271008-Reviews-Barri_de_Gracia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5
What a joy to find authentic Vietnamese style food in Gracia,We loved the weekend lunch menu at this Asian restaurant which was great value at 13.50€. After a recent trip to Vietnam it was wonderful to find tasty authentic spring rolls and pho with fresh herbs zinging through. My daughter loved the pork dumplings and satay chicken noodles. The staff were efficient and friendly and service very fast which was great as we had a guided tour at Casa Vicens nearby booked at 2.30pm. The restaurant is tiny and I quite understand them being unable to cater for buggies and high chairs as there simply would not be good access to serve customers or exit in an emergency.,December 2019,El Oso Panda,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d997611-Reviews-El_Oso_Panda-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Prefer the aerobus connection to the airport from Sants station rather than train,"There is a short ten minute walk from Sants train station to Placa Espagna bus stop, so not ideal if your cases are heavy, but I love the little cafe by the bus stop, a walk in the sunshine and then being taken directly to T1 or T2 depending on the bus you take. Very frequest and reliable.",November 2019,Aerobus Barcelona City Center to Airport Shuttle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187497-d19651390-Aerobus_Barcelona_City_Center_to_Airport_Shuttle-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",activities,5.0,4.5
