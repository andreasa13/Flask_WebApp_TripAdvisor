Amazing.,"Booked into the hotel on Sunday 27th Sept, we were greeted with a friendly welcome and a glass of Bubbly. The Hotel is beautiful and offers breath taking views of the ocean and lighthouse. The rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean. Amenities and towels are great as well. The staff are magnificent and attend to your every need. The protocols taken by the hotel due to covid restrictions were absolutely brilliant, From upon check in - to the breakfast buffet proper santization is ensured as well as regular temperature checks. This makes guests feel safe yet they can still enjoy all their facilities. The breakfast was scrumptious and a large variety was available. The only negative comment that I have would be that the curtains and balcony need maintainance.",September 2020,Beverly Hills,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312608-d316928-Reviews-Beverly_Hills-Umhlanga_Rocks_KwaZulu_Natal.html,"Umhlanga Rocks, South Africa",hotels,5.0,4.5
This hotel has huge potential.,"The staff employed at this Hotel are of excellence in hospitality, we were met by a lovely lady at reception and every staff member that I had an encounter with were thereafter were friendly and met our needs timeously and efficiently. The hotel has a great location and was easily accessible. The rooms had great views of the ocean and surrounding attractions. This hotel has been upgraded recently and although the rooms are really nice and spacious, the towels and linen were clean and good quality, the room amenities are great, the bottles of water were replenished daily and the turn down chocolates were a lovely treat. However the cleanliness is below std. The carpets were not washed or cleaned by upon
arrival nor during the two night stay. The bathroom mat had mould on it. The lounge area were also not wiped or cleaned. The shower water does not drain well and the tub had not been washed. I had addressed these with the house keeping lady however returned to the room exactly the same. The breakfast was plentiful and good.",December 2019,Blue Waters,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312595-d2279963-Reviews-Blue_Waters-Durban_KwaZulu_Natal.html,"Durban, South Africa",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Turned away for being alone.,"I had visited the Wimpy at Mall of Africa for a quick bite and coffee before attending a meeting, to my disappointment I was turned away from a ""normal"" table because the waiter had said I was alone. I could understand if the store was busy however there were not many people at the restaurant. Poor service.

Little Greece in Jhb,"This restaurant is fabulous. The decor, the veiw, the host and waiters are friendly making this restaurant a little gem. Authentic Greek food with a modern twist. The food is delicious and abundant so you wont go hungry. The cocktails are a tad expensive however are great anyway. The lamb chops are braai greek style. The yiros and souvlakis are amazing. The hummus could be abit better but still edible non the less. Will be back here time and again.",October 2019,Nikos Modderfontein,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3167721-d15541867-Reviews-Nikos_Modderfontein-Modderfontein_Greater_Johannesburg_Gauteng.html,"Modderfontein, South Africa",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Fantastic,"PAPPAS is always great. Their service is excellent and food always exceeds expectations. Their prawns are the best in JHB, while the lamb chops are good but could do with a little extra seasoning. The starters are great, the Haloumi with pita and hummus is superb. Thank you for always being consistent, with your hospitality and great standard of food.",October 2019,Pappas on the Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312586-d2332137-Reviews-Pappas_on_the_Square-Sandton_Greater_Johannesburg_Gauteng.html,"Sandton, South Africa",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Poor,"We had visited this restaurant to celebrate my grand mother's birthday, what was suppose to be a good evening out turned out quiete the opposite. Although our waiter was really good nothing else was up to std. The food is pre cooked and heated. Tasteless and unappetizing. 3 of our diahes got sent back, the veg palau was burnt, and had to be sent back. The paneer is of low quality, lacked flavour and had excessive salt. This you could see was reheated as it was watery and gross.
The fresh juices were served warm. The Dosa was good but the chutneys were all lacking in flavour. Not worth the money. Find alternative vegetarian options.",November 2019,Saravana Bhavan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312586-d8784781-Reviews-Saravana_Bhavan-Sandton_Greater_Johannesburg_Gauteng.html,"Sandton, South Africa",restaurants,1.0,4.0
My weekly hangout,"The food is always impeccable. Being a usual at this restaurant, the service is always great. The variety of options on the menu cater for vast variety of taste buds. My favorites are the tacos and the pastas. The Ginger Green juice are good for non cheat days. The cakes are simply out of this world, I have two favorites the custard coconut and the bar one cheese cake.

Disgusting food,This restaurant came highly recommended by a few friends and I decided to try it out. Ordered a take away of the chicken noodles and some sushi. The sushi was average and the chicken noodles were completely burnt. Waste of time and money.

Always Amazing,"The staff and management are so friendly and welcoming. The service is indredible and quick even though it was really busy. The food is of high quality, freshest ingredients and tasty. We had the haloumi and Greek salad starters, mains were peri peri prawns, the lamb chops, and souvlaki. The cocktails are great as well.

Average,"I have been to this restaurant when it first opened, and I was surprised to have such tasty Greek food in SA on that day the food was a definite 8/10. I have been back a few times since the opening and it looks as if the standard had dropped, the yiros are now dry and bland, and the lamb portions smaller.

High Tea,It was sensational. The 5 cause paired high tea was so incredible. It was literally 5hours of eating all the wonderful fresh food. The service was excellent we had two waitors Letty and Jerry and they were on the ball. Each course came exactly on time and was paired excellently with the food.

Just an average meal,"There was such a hype around this place the first time I visited Paris but I didn't have the time to check them out, so on my next visit this was on my bucket list of things to do. However, I was hugely disappointed, even though they claim to have famous Celebraties dine at their restaurant, their food is average, lacks flavor and the cleanliness is poor. The oily floors and tables are a complete put off. The service is really good though. They get 10 points for that.

All the room amenities that one would require are available and replaced daily. The hotel is located central to Roma termini and the city center.

"Overated,Overpriced, not worth your Rands.","The pictures and site reviews sell you aspects that look fantastic ...5star luxury as they claim. This place doesnt even have certification to prove that they 5star. I had requested this and the reception staff could not even provide me with it . The reception area is untidy with a guest toilet that is dirty and stained. They have no reception area aircondioning, the pool is a small splash pool that isnt great for swimming and which isnt the cleanest. The view from the hotel is incredible, the breakfast provided to our room patio and the breakfast staff are fantastic , these aspects gets a solid 8.5/10. The location is perfect within walking distance from the town and bus station. However what grades this place down for me personally, was that the rooms need upgrading, I do understand the authentic greek theme in the rooms,however since they claim 5 star they should provide 5star towels, bed linen, and general room amenities which they do not. The bathroom had abit of mould around the shower. The housekeeping services would not even wash out the cups provided for drinking. Upon check out at 2am the man ( not even worthy of being called a gentleman) at the reception desk was beyond rude to my husband and I, which resulted in a screaming match over a pack of Pringles which we did not even consume. After almost half n hour of arguing we had no appology from him nor a reply from the hotel regarding his rachet behaviour. Is that how they treat guests?! There is no ""5star"" hotel in the world that would treat people the way they do. My advise, there are proper 5star rated hotels in Santorini you would get value for money elsewhere.",August 2018,Aigialos Luxury Traditional Settlement,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d235725-Reviews-Aigialos_Luxury_Traditional_Settlement-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,2.0,4.5
Delicious with Value for money,We Tried out Lucky's based on TripAdvisor reviews and this place did not disappoint. Delicious food at an affordable price.

Really Good,"Tried Oblelix out on our first day in Santorini , and it was really good. They use a chilli sprinkle which is really gives it a great flavour.

Spectacular views and sunsets,"The view is magnificent and the sunset is incredible from this restaurant. However the waiters are unfriendly. Stumbled upon this place while taking a walk through the town, the amazing view is what captured the attention so we decided on going there for drinks and dessert, the cocktails are good whilst the baklava is terrible.

The bedsheets do not fit properly. The bathrooms are in terrible condition. There is mould and grime on tiles and shower. The taps are broken. Towels do not get changed and the cups and glasses do not get washed. The telephone did not work and there was black tape around the door to hold up the electronic disc.
