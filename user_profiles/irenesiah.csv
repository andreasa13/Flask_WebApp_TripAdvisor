Clean & Beautiful Interior,Stayed just a night at Essence Hanoi before heading to Sapa and Halong Bay after - hotel staff were friendly and rooms were all intricately designed; and they look exactly like the photos posted online.,August 2018,Aira Boutique Hanoi Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293924-d2298266-Reviews-Aira_Boutique_Hanoi_Hotel_Spa-Hanoi.html,"Hanoi, Vietnam",hotels,5.0,5.0
Deliciousness even in delivery,"Been in-store for their ice-cream and decided to do a delivery for their mains. Love the Vongole Linguine, and I'm quite amazed how their chicken wings were still crisp in every bite despite the long distance delivery from the cafe to my place. Also ordered their Tom Yum Thin Crust Pizza and cream mushroom soups - both were flavourful and very appetising in general. Would definitely love to dine in here once the circuit breaker measures are lifted in Singapore.",April 2020,Ice Edge Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d3730111-Reviews-Ice_Edge_Cafe-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Great Hospitality As Always,"Had a great flight with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Tokyo. Still love the hot towels provided each time we come on board, and the in-flight entertainment was updated with a wide range of movies and TV shows. We were hungry in the midst of the flight (even after inflight meal was served) and the air stewardess gave us a variety of cookies as snacks to fill our tummy. She even asked if we would like to opt for a cup noodle, which we were quite surprised. Very hospitable, definitely looking forward to flying again with Singapore Airlines when travel is back to normal again.",January 2020,Singapore Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729151-Reviews-Singapore-Airlines,World,flights,5.0,4.5
Skewers Paradise,"This is a paradise for all swekers lovers. Mostly prepared by the kitchen and cooked beforehand, the tray box is literally just for keeping thr skewers warm. Most skewers will be seasoned with their signature mala powder, if you don't wish to this spice you may opt out (just got to tell the staff). Visited this place with non-local friends and they love it too. Cheap and tasty!

Cute 3D Latte Art,"Came here cos we're around Changi area, hanging around before heading to Pulau Ubin. You've got to mention to the staff that you'd like a 3D foam art (if not they'd assume you won't) and it's applicable only to ice lattes. Rather pricey for the drink but you've got to give it for the barrista's craftsmanship. Hot latte also came in a flat 2D cute design. There's free Wi-Fi available too.

Tasty but Pricey,"Bearable queue and waiting, took about 30 min in total before we got to enjoy the burgers. Got two burgers and a portion of their cheese fries. Definitely tasty but not sure if it was worth the price to revisit often as a fast-food option.

Good for Quick Meal,"Went to the Vivo City basement branch. Ordered the chicken rice that is just S$4.80 each, its simple and fuss free. Portion might be small to some but it's just enough for us.

AMAZING Coconut Shake,"Went to the branch at Jewel Changi Airport basement. Was told that their coconut shake is a must-try so we chose the Coconut Avocado Shake with 0% sugar, and we added a scoop of coconut ice-cream. It was THE BEST shake we've had. Cos we chose 0%, I was surprised the shake still turned out super delicious! The natural sweetness of the coconut is sweet enough, and we love the coconut bites on every sip we had.

"Tasty, Decent Portion but Pricey Nasi Lemak","I won't say this is the best nasi lemak I've had because I definitely had better ones in Singapore that are half the price of what The Coconut Club charges. No doubt their chicken leg portions are great, love the chilli but for the price, I won't necessarily come back again unless I've got a friend in town who wants to try it. They're quite strict on the queue too, so make sure all your friends turn up and queue altogether since they'd only alloe you to enter when everyone turns up.",March 2020,The Coconut Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d11851140-Reviews-The_Coconut_Club-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Authentic Greek Cuisine,"Was looking for a local restaurant to wrap up our trip to Greece and chanced upon Ta Karamanlidika. We were lucky that we came in slightly before the peak dinner time, hence we were given a seat right away. Since the menu was entirely in Greek, we asked for recommendations by the staff. We enjoyed every single dish, including the complimentary dessert.

Only Convent in Meteora,"Smaller in scale as compared to our first monastery visit at Varlaam. Good views from the small deck, and there are significantly lesser steps to climb as compared to the rest. Definitely good for people who can't too much climb stairs. Beautiful little garden courtyards at the back of the church too.",August 2019,Agios Stefanos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315843-d243297-Reviews-Agios_Stefanos-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Beautiful Spacious Monastery,The first monastery we visited in Meteora and we were one of the first tour groups to arrive. Do take note of strict dress codes to all monasteries in Meteora. Long skirts and sleeved tops/dresses are required to enter. Females in jeans/slacks and males in berms are required were all given a skirt (free rental) to wrap over before you can enter.

Average for 1 Night Stay,"Hotel was arranged by Key Tours as part of our 2D1N Delphi Meteora Tour. It was decent for just 1 night, don't expect too much and you'd be good. Food was OK.

Part of the Delphi Archaeological Site,It's part of the entrance into the Delphi Archaeological Site. Walk further up and you'd find the ruins of the Temple of Apollo.

Delphi-nitely Worth It,"Came here as the first pit stop of our 2D1N Delphi Meteora Tour. Sun was scorching hot, there aren't any shelters since its the ruins of an archaeological site.

Scenic Boat Ride,"Was looking for an activity to do in Santorini and our hotel staff recommended going on a Volcano boat tour. Definitely a great way to go around different islands. Departed from the old port of Fira, you can choose to walk down like we did (or you can choose to take the poor horses, or take the cableway from the top). There is also a small hike at the first volcano pit stop. Good to wear proper shoes. 3 hour was just sufficient for the tour. We didn't bother to jump into the 'hotspring' water cos we've read reviews on how it's not that fantastic. We did not regret to choose to stay onboard. Overall a good experience and recommended for anyone finding activities to do in Santorini.",August 2019,Santorini Volcano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d288470-Reviews-Santorini_Volcano-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Decent Restaurant by the Jetty,"Had an hour stopover at Thirassia Island during our Oia Santorini Volcano Tour and we honestly weren't sure which restaurant to enter.

Lovely Local Restaurant,"Love the interior of this restaurant, it's spacious and well-ventilated during the hot summer season. Really affordable local food (love the fish!) and generous portions.

Highly recommended to anyone visiting Athens.",August 2019,To 24oro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4591125-Reviews-To_24oro-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Sunset Views & Ambiance,"My fiancé made a reservation a couple weeks prior to our trip in order to get a good seat of the sunset view.

Certainly a great meal with great ambiance!",August 2019,Remvi Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635607-d2478475-Reviews-Remvi_Restaurant-Firostefani_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0

BEST Sunset View in Santorini!,"Was recommended this restaurant by our hotel staff since it's just a 5-min walk. We were hesitant at first as we thought why should we have Mexican food when we came all the way to Greece. Nonetheless, we went ahead and boy we did not regret! Despite having no reservations, we were lucky that we got the best sea-facing seat ever for that spectacular sunset view. Food portions here were generous, and the homemade sangria was probably the best I've ever had! Felt almost like a hidden gem and we were so glad we came. Skip that crowded touristy Oia sunset and visit here instead!",August 2019,Senor Zorba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1097549-d1867523-Reviews-Senor_Zorba-Pyrgos_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Food & Most Passionate Owner,"Was intrigued by this restaurant cos most reviews mentioned about the owner Irene. We decided to make a booking at this restaurant in downtown Fira and we were so glad we did! It was possibly the most homely dinner we had in Santorini. Food was amazing and Irene explained to us every dish, how her husband goes to the market early to get the freshest ingredients. To our surprise, she even gave every guests a complimentary dessert. Love Irene's passion and enthusiasm with both her restaurant and her guests. Definitely recommend!",August 2019,Salt & Pepper,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d2056888-Reviews-Salt_Pepper-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Immersive History Lesson,"Backpacks are not allowed, hence it'd have to be checked at the side counter. A good place to hide from the scorching hot sun, it is recommended to visit here in the afternoon (when it's the hottest outside). Learnt great lessons on the history of Greece, especially the new outdoor excavation exhibition located in the basement. The excavation was probably the most amazing exhibits, there is even a video documenting the process of this excavation.

Marvelling Cultural Experience,Definitely a must-see when you're in Athens! Felt like a travel back in time when you are immersed in the scenes of the ruins.

"Clean, Affordable & Amazing Hospitality","Most hotels in downtown Fira or even Oia are not only expensive but you may end up paying so much with tourists peeping into yr hotel. Located just 2-3min away from downtown Fira, the hotel offers free shuttle to/fro downtown that you can easily request anytime. Love the architecture, the amazing breakfast spread, the pool with complimentary big float, and most importantly, the friendliness of the hotel staff. There is a Mexican restaurant recommended by the staff, which is just 5min walk from the hotel and it has the best sunset views we've seen while in Santorini.

Small portions for the price,"Decent taste, similar to back in Korea but the portions are just alot smaller than what you'll in Korea.

Known for their generous thick slices of sashimi in their chirashi don, they didn't disappoint as expected. Tried their soft shell crab maki hand roll and it's amazing for it's price.

Not quite a place for you to sit down long for chats since it's mostly bar tools in the small cafe.
