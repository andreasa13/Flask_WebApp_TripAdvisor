So happy to have made it back to Ammos in 2020,"This is a review I’ve been putting off writing - Ammos is such a wonderful place that I didn’t want everybody else to find out about it (!) This hotel is always full just by word of mouth - its success is totally down to how brilliant it is and although it’s been featured among recommendations in the Sunday Times and other newspapers and magazines over the years, I don’t think Nikos (the owner) has sought the publicity…

But 2020 is different, people feel nervous travelling and long-held reservations are being cancelled, so if you are thinking about booking I really want to encourage you to do so.

We’ve just returned from Ammos for the 12th consecutive year and all the great things in these reviews are totally true. When we first found Ammos our children were young (3 and 5) and we wanted a small hotel that could accommodate our family comfortably, a safe sandy beach, a pool and a decent restaurant (not buffet). Ammos delivered on all of that, but what keeps us coming back is the customer-focussed approach. The level of service is exceptional, not in an overbearing obsequious way, but in a natural and friendly way that means that you totally relax as soon as you arrive at this place. Service at Ammos is very much a team effort - the same core team has been there for at least the last 12 years and they are all absolutely amazing (without realising how good they are!).

The food is also exceptional. Last year we stopped in Athens for a few days en route home and it was only then that we fully appreciated the consistency and quality of the food at Ammos. This isn’t Michelin star cooking but it is decent honest Greek food, often with a modern twist – in addition to the standard menu, there are daily specials and all the dishes are thoughtfully put together and lovingly prepared, showcasing the best local produce. Nikos is a foodie (as are we) and he’s constantly tweaking and improving things all the time - new this year is a pastry chef making the most delicious breakfast pastries and yummy new desserts.

For 2020 Ammos is Covid-safe, with social distancing between tables and loungers, all the staff in masks and an even more thorough cleaning regime. The hotel was full in August and yet it was easy to socially distance everywhere in the hotel and on the beach. Nearly everybody was a repeat visitor, which says so much about the confidence people have that they’d feel safe in the Ammos “bubble” at this unsettling time. We certainly did and we feel blessed to have had another wonderful and totally relaxing holiday at Ammos this year.",August 2020,Ammos Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1574391-d288931-Reviews-Ammos_Hotel-Agii_Apostoli_Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Private Tour with Nadia Pavlikaki,"The Acropolis Museum really is a “must see” in Athens. We decided to book a private tour of the museum with a licensed guide, Nadia Pavlikaki, which was excellent and had the added benefit of “skip the line” access. Nadia met us at the entrance to the Acropolis Museum and really brought the museum to life for us, skilfully guiding us around the displays and explaining the historical and mythical context as we went. The whole design of this modern museum is conceived to show off the treasures of the Acropolis in the most effective way. The upper floor has the same dimensions as the Parthenon and the exhibits really enable you to visualise the scale of the structure and the amazing statutes that adorned it. Nadia is warm and friendly and most importantly, extremely knowledgeable and engaging. Our teenage daughters (aged 13 and 15) enjoyed the tour of the Acropolis Museum with Nadia as much as we did.",August 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Private guide Nadia Pavlikaki brings Acropolis to life,"Having visited the Acropolis Museum during the afternoon, we went up to the Acropolis around 5.30pm, taking advantage of the cooling breeze at the end of a hot day at the end of August. We had pre-booked a licensed guide, Nadia Pavlikaki, who was able to get us “skip the line” tickets. Having just visited the museum with Nadia, she was able to bring the ruins to life for us so that we really understood the significance of what we were seeing and visualise how these monuments would have been many centuries before. So much better than just wandering around without really having much idea about it all, as many other people seemed to be doing! A word of caution, you really do need to wear sensible shoes up there as the surface is very uneven and slippery in places (even when the weather is dry as it usually is). We have used private tour guides in other cities and we agreed that Nadia was exceptional – so knowledgeable and engaging. We highly recommend her to anybody who really wants to make the most of their precious time in Athens.",August 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Almost perfect lunch,"It was with some trepidation that we approached our lunch booking at Restaurant Story. The last couple of reviews we’d read on TripAdvisor had been disappointing and with so much choice in London for a special venue for lunch, were we going to be disappointed with our choice? Happily, we were not. We enjoyed the £80 lunch with matched drinks (additional £60 per person) and the whole experience was wonderful – exactly as we’d hoped in terms of an eating journey full of exquisite and inventive combinations of flavours and textures, thoughtfully matched with the paired drinks, most of which worked extremely well. The service was spot on – friendly yet efficient. The pace of the meal was perfect. The setting was also fine – having read the reviews about the situation of the restaurant on a traffic island, the view was much better than I was expecting (some nice planting in the foreground and The Shard in the background) and the restaurant was a stone’s throw from City Hall. We so wanted to give this place a five star review, but unfortunately the main course beef was a bit chewy – it looked melt-in-the-mouth delicious and it had been cooked sous-vide, so it should have been exactly that, but for some reason both of us experienced the same chewiness – hopefully this isn’t representative and will be easily rectified. We have read reviews comparing this place to The Fat Duck, and whilst I can see the comparison, I don’t think it’s necessarily a valid one – Heston’s Fat Duck menu is much more of an immersive experience for all 5 senses and I don’t think Heston would have served the mash potato dish – there was definitely scope to include something even more interesting at this point in the meal (but then again, it tasted delicious and we didn’t pay Fat Duck prices here). Also, whilst I would always recommend anybody to go for the matched drinks to complement the food when having this type of meal, we did feel that the drinks, albeit for the most part excellent with the food, weren’t as good value as the pairings we’d enjoyed elsewhere (and as wine lovers, we’d have preferred another glass of wine, possibly with the scallop course). All that said, overall we really did enjoy our lunch and would highly recommend Restaurant Story to anyone who appreciates a fine dining experience and something just that little bit different.",January 2017,Restaurant Story,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d4086680-Reviews-Restaurant_Story-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Outstanding value Saturday lunch with champagne and cocktails,"This was our first time at Sake no Hana and we loved it! We had the Umai Sushi Saturday menu which was 7 delicious courses with a cocktail and half a bottle of Louise Roederer champagne included for £49. The meal was excellent value for money - really fantastic flavours and quality - the beef main course was melt in the mouth tender as were all the fish sushi dishes and the Bamboo dessert was a visual treat. The cocktails were exquisite (excellent selection, beautifully mixed and thoughtfully presented) and the champagne flowed. The service was excellent and the ambience was buzzing - just right for a Saturday lunch - highly recommended and we will definitely return.",January 2017,Sake no Hana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d928581-Reviews-Sake_no_Hana-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Exquisite 7 course degustation menu with wine flight,"This was our second visit to the Bathers Pavillion restaurant at Balmoral beach and it lived up to our high expectations based on our memories of fine dining with a wonderful view of the sea. We thoroughly enjoyed the 7 course degustation menu with matching wines, so many delicious flavours complemented by efficient service from friendly waiting staff. A wonderful place for a special meal and top of our list for when we're next in Sydney.",December 2016,Bathers' Pavilion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g552107-d755281-Reviews-Bathers_Pavilion-Mosman_Greater_Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Mosman, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Tapas near Waterloo,"We were looking for a place to enjoy tapas close to Waterloo and this fitted the bill. The restaurant felt like a little piece of Spain with a large horseshoe bar surrounded by high stools (there plenty of other tables too), tiled walls and Spanish-speaking staff. There was a chap playing Spanish guitar which enhanced the ambience (I'd been worried this would be a bit ""naff""). The service was friendly, the prices were reasonable, the food was good though I think it depends on what you order - the jamon iberico was ""melt-in-the-mouth"" delicious and the stuffed aubergine was yummy but the gambas al ajillo was a little disappointing - not served bubbling in oil with fresh garlic & chilli as we've had so often in Spain and the chorizo in the spicy potatoes was a bit bland. That said, overall we enjoyed our ""little bit of Spain"" on a miserable January evening and would return.",January 2017,Meson Don Felipe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1017410-Reviews-Meson_Don_Felipe-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Excellent 5 night stay,"We recently booked 2 rooms (a deluxe queen and a deluxe twin) for 5 nights over the New Year period for our family of four (2 adults and two children aged 10 and 12). I’m happy to confirm all the positive reviews I’d read before I booked this hotel almost a year ago now – the beds are comfortable, the bathroom is clean and everything works, there’s free Wi-Fi, a free mini bar, a coffee machine (mineral water & Nespresso capsules replenished daily) – the rooms have everything you could want including a full length mirror and an ironing board too (not that ironing is “my thing” on holiday!). My only concern prior to arrival was the small size of the rooms and whether we’d find enough space for our large suitcases and I’m happy to report that, once we’d taken delivery of a few extra coat hangers, we were able to unpack our large suitcases and stow them away under the desk no problem (2 in one room). The hotel is an easy walk to Circular Quay, the botanical gardens (where we celebrated New Year’s Eve), Darling Harbour and the shopping district. This is our 6th year visiting Sydney and over the years we’ve stayed in the Four Seasons, the Marriott, the Radisson, the Intercontinental and the Holiday Inn…we’ve also walked up the hill to have cocktails at the Shangri La a couple of times too. From a comfort, location and practical point of view (having 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms for our family) we wouldn’t hesitate to book the Tank Stream again next time we’re in Sydney.",December 2016,The Tank Stream Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255060-d8488014-Reviews-The_Tank_Stream_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",hotels,5.0,4.0
Awe-inspiring views,Our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children) spent a night in a corner view suite at this small hotel which boasts the most amazing views. We’d previously stayed at Lilianfels and were delighted to be able to make the most of the facilities there (including dining in Darley’s restaurant and swimming in the outdoor pool) as well as being able to take in the views at every opportunity from our room (look out for the clouds hanging in the valley first thing in the morning – we couldn’t believe our eyes!).

Relaxing stay among the vines,"We stayed in a Premier Suite at Hermitage Lodge for two nights just before Christmas 2016. The accommodation was exactly as we were expecting and perfect for our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children aged 10 and 12), beautifully located among the vines, spotless, well-appointed with everything we needed and extremely comfortable. We enjoyed the spa tub, the generous continental breakfast (provided in the fridge in our suite accompanied by proper coffee from the bean-to-cup coffee machine) and the delicious Italian food and friendly service in the restaurant on both nights. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this lovely place.",December 2016,Hermitage Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255328-d456700-Reviews-Hermitage_Lodge-Pokolbin_Cessnock_Greater_Newcastle_New_South_Wales.html,"Pokolbin, Australia",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Wonderful wine, delicious food, fun & friendly hosts","We spent a very enjoyable day on the Two Fat Blokes’ Hunter Gatherer tour in December 2016. What a treat! Andrew our host escorted us to 5 wineries and a brewery and the day included cheese & wine, chocolate and wine and a wonderful deli style lunch with amazing vineyard views. We really love our wine and are real foodies too and the day more than met our expectations – we learned a lot about the Hunter Valley’s wines and winemaking history and were delighted to meet so many friendly and knowledgeable hosts. That said, the tour was perfectly pitched to be enjoyed by wine buffs & novices alike and even our children (poor things had to come along for the ride!) enjoyed their day out in the wine country.",December 2016,Uncork the Hunter Full Day Wine Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g3947990-d11483997-Uncork_the_Hunter_Full_Day_Wine_Tour-Hunter_Valley_New_South_Wales.html,"Hunter Valley, Australia",activities,5.0,5.0
2 amazing days in St Petersburg - I'd recommend Best Guides to anyone.,"We had a 2 day stopover in St Petersburg as part of our cruise on Cunard’s Queen Elizabeth in August 2016. As a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children aged 10 and 12), the cost of booking two days of tours with Cunard was going to be extremely high and, from my research, it seemed that a private tour with a St Petersburg tour company would be a better option because we’d get a more bespoke tour tailored to our needs.

Having researched the options well in advance, in May I decided to contact Best Guides because of the positive reviews on Trip Advisor backed up with all the information on their website – they looked as though they used the best guides and drivers and really understood how to deliver good tours.

My initial contact was with Kira, who came back very quickly with all the information I needed, including an outline itinerary and costs. The information provided was extremely comprehensive and answered all the questions I had in my mind (including visas – no need for us to organise anything in advance, payment – no up-front payment needed we could pay with our credit card when we were in Russia and tips – 10% for the guide, 5% for the driver payable in cash (dollars, euros or roubles). I asked for the itinerary to be tweaked (although then ended up booking the first option)… I found the email communication with Kira extremely straightforward – she responded quickly and was very professional.

We made the booking. That said, there is always a bit of trepidation when you’re booking in advance, without paying a penny and, after all, it’s Russia! I emailed a couple of days before our tour date, just to reconfirm and received an email by return to reassure me that our guide would meet us in the cruise terminal at the allotted time.

We allowed plenty of time to get through Russian immigration at the cruise terminal, armed only with our passports and Best Guides tour tickets. There was no queue at all (possibly because we weren’t going through as part of a bigger tour group from the ship) and our passports were duly stamped and we went through without a problem.

Although we arrived earlier than expected, our guide Elena was there to meet us. She took us to our waiting car and driver, Andrew (sorry if I’ve spelt this wrong!). We were amazed to see a Mercedes car/minivan and we each had our own seat with armrests – very comfortable. We were also provided with bottles of water and there were rain ponchos just in case. The car was equipped with a microphone and speakers so that we could all hear what Elena was saying without any problem. We were also given a family tree of the Russian royal family (really useful to put all this history into context) and a map of the city so that we could orientate ourselves (not that we really needed to!). We hadn’t even left the cruise terminal and we were impressed!

Our tour started with a drive around the city and the chance to stop off and take photos. Elena was absolutely amazing – extremely friendly and knowledgeable with such a wonderful understanding of the history of St Petersburg and all the buildings and sights. She did her first degree in languages and her second in history, so she was able to tell us all about it in beautifully fluent English. Andrew didn’t speak much English but he was really friendly and we felt safe in his hands. Importantly, he was always exactly where he was meant to be at every stop over the 2 day period and negotiated the St Petersburg traffic with ease.

Our tour on the first day included Peterhof (timed to arrive when the fountains are switched on accompanied by music at 11am) and Catherine’s Palace. We had a fabulous lunch in a restaurant outside in the sun at Peterhof. One of the questions I’d had was whether we’d be better to take the hydrofoil to Peterhof rather than drive and I have to say that the drive was really interesting (just to be driving through the different parts of St Petersburg and hearing about the siege of St Petersburg during WW2 and what it’s like to live in Russia in more recent times).

On the second day, we went on the metro, visited a food market and got an early entrance into the Hermitage (9.55 I think it was). This was great – Elena whisked us around so that we were ahead of the crowds and we saw so many things that I’m sure we just wouldn’t have seen up close had we gone in later with the crowds. Elena took us to a shop with toilets & coffee before we went into the Hermitage – there was no pressure to buy anything and it was absolutely brilliant to use the facilities rather than face the queues in the museum!

After a light lunch in a typical Russian pancake “fast food” restaurant (yummy!), we went on to St Isaac’s Cathedral, Church on Spilled Blood and the Peter & Paul Cathedral.

Elena was absolutely fantastic at getting us in to all the sights without queuing (and on the one occasion we had to wait for 5 minutes or so at St Catherine’s Palace, we were in before everybody else waiting, and so it was really no problem.

Just to allay any fears on the money and visas, you definitely do not need a Russian visa if you book a tour with Best Guides. We didn’t really need roubles, but we got some from the cash point in the cruise terminal on the second day (mainly because I wanted to buy a souvenir fridge magnet!). Also, we paid for our tour on credit card on the second day without any problem and we were absolutely delighted to tip Elena and Andrew in cash (paying a mixture of roubles & dollars).

At various points we encountered the Cunard tour parties and we were just so happy that we were on our own, just the four of us, with Elena. We had so much information and the opportunity to ask questions and, whilst we ended up exhausted after 2 days of tours, we really felt that we’d made the most of our time in St Petersburg and had seen everything at a pace that suited our family. And of course, this was a much cheaper option than the Cunard tours. Thank you Elena – you are a total star and it was a delight to spend two days in your company. I would recommend booking a tour with Best Guides to anyone.",August 2016,"Best of the Best 2-day Tour Including St Petersburg, Peterhof, Catherine's Palace",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g298507-d14880224-Best_of_the_Best_2_day_Tour_Including_St_Petersburg_Peterhof_Catherine_s_Palace-St.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",activities,5.0,5.0
"Warm welcome, comfortable rooms, fantastic breakfast","We received a warm welcome when we stayed as a family at Castleton House for one night last weekend. Castleton House is located just off the A303 in the centre of the village of Mere and is particularly well situated for pubs and restaurants. My husband felt safe parking his (“pride & joy”) car on the road right outside the front door and we weren’t disturbed by any traffic noise at all. We were in the double room (which has a 5ft UK king size bed) and our children (aged 8 and 10) shared the twin room. The rooms were nicely furnished and well-equipped, exactly as shown on the website. We found the beds extremely comfortable and the bathrooms clean and in good working order (we greatly appreciated the powerful flow of warm water in the shower). We didn't get a chance to use the guest sitting room but it looked warm and inviting. Nor did we avail ourselves of the “hospitality trays” in our rooms, but we appreciated the thoughtful touch of providing fresh milk in a little fridge in each room. Our short stay ended with a delicious breakfast including homemade and locally sourced produce – our children are still talking about the scrummy apple juice and the “full English” was of the highest quality (and I have to confess that I’m particularly fussy about these things!) with eggs and toast made to order. Thank you Gail – we are very happy to recommend Castleton House and would return without hesitation.",January 2015,Castleton House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616276-d648542-Reviews-Castleton_House-Mere_Wiltshire_England.html,"Mere, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,5.0
