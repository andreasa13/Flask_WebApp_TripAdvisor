Dinner with my Partner,"My partner booked a table for 6:30 for Tuesday 25th August which, unfortunately, was not in the book, but this did not prove a problem for the staff who quickly found us a table and I am so delighted they did. The restaurant is far from pretentious but the food is truly outstanding. So much so that I am going to go back again very soon and will be taking friends and family there when they visit us. The owner (Hassan) was wonderful and chatted to us at length but was not intrusive. The other staff were excellent and the whole evening was a truly delightful experience. If you have not eaten here please do so, you will not be disappointed.",August 2020,Ocean Fish Platter,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190725-d17397500-Reviews-Ocean_Fish_Platter-Ipswich_Suffolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Lunch with Friends,May partner and I live just outside Ipswich and we visit Hornchurch occasionally which we did yesterday to meet up with some friends for the first time since lockdown. We booked a table for a late lunch but the food was far below the standard we had experienced there previously. We had 2 fish and chip meals which were not properly cooked and quite tasteless and my own meal (Chargrilled chicked) was only what I would describe as adequate. My friends wife had Pasta which was very nice and I wish I had chosen that meal myself. For dessert my partner had treacle sponge which was very gooey and not very hot. We enjoyed the afternoon due to the company but the meal was extremely disappointing and I am not sure I would go there again.,August 2020,The Ardleigh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503784-d1955073-Reviews-The_Ardleigh-Hornchurch_Greater_London_England.html,"Hornchurch, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Acropolis visit,"We stopped off at the Acropolis during our Hop On - Hop Off bus tour of Athens. It was dreadful. The pavements were uneven and slippery and my partner had a bad fall. The place was crowded (of course) but worse than this was the traffic making negotiation of pathways difficult due to crowds and parked taxis. The Acropolis is, of course, an amazing site to view, but actually getting there is truly awful!!!",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,1.0,4.5
Baggage Transfer,"When we docked at Piraeus on 19th October, we had a problem - what do we do with our luggage during the 9 hours before we could check in at the airport for our 9pm flight. The answer was use Baggagement. This superb company collected our 2 large suitcases at the port and delivered to them to our check in desk at the aiport. They were professional in every respect. Contact, timings, security, reliability and efficiency as well a great value for money - just 20 euros to pick up and deliver the bags. We were then free to take the Athens tour at our leisure and enjoy our day. I cannot recommend them highly enough and would urge anyone using Athens airport or port that need luggage stored and delivered to not consider any alternative to Baggagement - They are brilliant!!!",October 2019,My Athens Transfers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d9846275-Reviews-My_Athens_Transfers-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Birthday dinner,The meal we had and the whole experience at the Last Anchor was quite simply superb. The food was first class and the service excellent. We had sufficient time between courses to chat and to simply allow our food to digest before the next course was served. The menu choice was excellent and the value for money outstanding. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys wonderful food served in an atmosphere which is relaxed and comfortable. I shall definitely go back when the weather is hopefully a bit better.,January 2018,The Last Anchor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190725-d802915-Reviews-The_Last_Anchor-Ipswich_Suffolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great Night Out,Had a fabulous night in La Herradura on 16th October 2015. Was in a party of 8 with 4 American friends who thought the whole experience totally terrific. The Flamenco ladies were excellent and the food very good too. I will definitely go back and would recommend it to friends as well.,October 2015,La Herradura Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1918425-d2481967-Reviews-La_Herradura_Restaurant-Los_Montesinos_Province_of_Alicante_Valencian_Country.html,"Los Montesinos, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Sunday Lunch,"Had a very pleasant Sunday lunch here, having been on several occasions previously, but was a bit disappointed that both Mains on the Special menu had been crossed off - our lunch table was booked for 2.15 so not very late. In addition there was no Roast Lamb either. The carrots served were very undercooked and I had to ask 3 different members of staff for 2 glasses of tap water to go with our main course. By the time we got the water we had finished our meal. Jury is very much out as to whether we will go back.",October 2015,George & Dragon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503773-d2442830-Reviews-George_Dragon-Brentwood_Borough_of_Brentwood_Essex_England.html,"Brentwood, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
