Best of Athens,"I was a tiny bit disappointed in the food we had in Athens - nothing really struck me as that one memorable meal. Then, on our last meal in Greece, we found Rosalia. This place was so good. The food was great and the prices were very reasonable. It is a short walk from the National Archeological Museum, which will take you through an... interesting... neighborhood. No one gave us any trouble, the food is worth it.",February 2020,Rozalia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d814501-Reviews-Rozalia-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Something different - so much fun,"I am not sure I learned much about cooking, but it was a really memorable experience. The process of working together to prepare a meal got people talking and interacting. By the time we sat down to eat the dinner conversation flowed naturally. Sophia (our teacher) really had a knack for getting people involved, then letting interactions develope naturally. This is not your same old tour, I really recommend you give it a try.",February 2020,Athens Cooking Day Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d3602683-Reviews-Athens_Cooking_Day_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Experience the rest of Athens,"Our guide Georgia, was fantastic. She took us away from the tourist mainstays, for a look at how the city appears to Athenians. She was energetic and clearly passionate about her city. We saw (and tasted) things we would have otherwise missed. Time is valuable on a vacation, but this tour is definitely worth the half day.",February 2020,Athens Food Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d3198860-Reviews-Athens_Food_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
A nice but unremarkable restaurant,"The food was good and the servers were friendly, but it was noisy.

Must see,"I don't know if it is really necessary to write this review. I can't imagine anyone travelling to Athens and not seeing the Acropolis, but if you are considering skipping it - don't.

Best castle ever,"In all fairness, I have only been in a half dozen castles so I am probably not qualified to present the “Best Castle Ever” award.

Lunch deal was amazing,"This place was recommended by the concierge, so I hadn’t checked the reviews on trip advisor before eating there. The meal was fantastic. When I found it here to write this review I was surprised to se it ranked 84th - I thought it would have been much higher. I read through the bad reviews and they did not match our experience at all. Servers were friendly and the food was delicious. Definitely try this place for lunch (before 4:00) since the prices are lower but the portions are still large. The venison pie is a must try and the muscles are worth the £1 up charge.",September 2019,Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186534-d12421745-Reviews-Ardnamurchan_Scottish_Restaurant_Bar-Glasgow_Scotland.html,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Learn a lot in a short time,"I really liked this place. There is not a lot of depth to the information given; but, it is a great overview. It gives you a little bit of context to think about the economy, history and people of Iceland as you see the country. Every video was well made.

Of course, as mentioned by so many others, there is free coffee.",September 2019,Tales from Iceland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189970-d12846551-Reviews-Tales_from_Iceland-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great seafood,"The food here was really top notch. The flavor and presentation were both impressive. The serving size wasn’t huge, but was reasonable and the price seemed completely fair. It is hard for me to comment on service. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, but we were eating at an odd time and were one of two tables - not a real test.",September 2019,Reykjavík Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d14156798-Reviews-Reykjavik_Kitchen-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,5.0
A lot of small disappointments,"There was no one thing I can point to on why I would not return this hotel. The room was clean and the staff was reasonably friendly. Unfortunately, there were multiple things that all added up to an unpleasant experience so I will just list the main ones:

-the room had no fan and the neighborhood is way too loud all night to open a window
-the mattress was very hard and uncomfortable
-the vent in the bathroom was stuck shut and I had to prop it open with a Q-tip (I hoped that would circulate some air, but it didn’t help.)
-There is no safe to store valuables in the room.
-since there was no safe, we left the “do not disturb” sign out all day but the cleaners entered anyway and did their room service (nothing was stolen or gone through, but still that was not ok.)
-by 7:00 there was enough loud noises to wake us up one day (the other day was quieter, so this could have been singular incident.)

I feel like this hotel made a half-hearted effort to be higher end. The facade and lobby are nice enough, but once you enter the elevators it feels a lot mor budget.",August 2018,Fitzwilton Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186638-d622902-Reviews-Fitzwilton_Hotel-Waterford_County_Waterford.html,"Waterford, Ireland",hotels,2.0,4.0
This is what a hotel should be,"If you check my other reviews you will see I don’t give hotels 5 stars very often, but this one earned it.

If I am ever in Dublin again, this is the hotel I will stay at.",August 2018,Ashling Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186605-d212690-Reviews-Ashling_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great for self-guided tour,"This is a fantastic museum. It gives a walkthrough of Irish history with plenty of placards and videos to put everything into context. We had only planned an hour here, but ended up doubling that. Even then we only left because we had a scheduled tour. If you love history this is a half day attraction as you read and inspect all the exhibits. Even if you are not that interested in history, the bog-mummies alone are worth the time.",August 2018,National Museum of Ireland - Archaeology,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d274489-Reviews-National_Museum_of_Ireland_Archaeology-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Just like Italy,"I try to stick to local cuisine when traveling (why come to Ireland to eat Italian food?), but we made an exception based for Emiliano’s based on reviews. I am glad we did. The food, the atmosphere, everything reminded me how much I loved eating in Italy. My cod was really good, but my wife’s beef linguini was fantastic.",August 2018,Emiliano's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186638-d2317809-Reviews-Emiliano_s-Waterford_County_Waterford.html,"Waterford, Ireland",restaurants,5.0,5.0

Small room but very nice,"The small room didn’t bother me, but might matter to some. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. The location was great - the neighborhood is walkable with plenty of pubs and restaurants. You will have to pay to park. There are two garages, one is cheap but may not be appropriate for large vehicles while the other is quite expensive.

"Meh, just a pub","The food was mediocre and the service was lackluster. To be fair they did have a “help wanted” sign in the window and an extra server or two might have helped on that side of things. There was nothing wrong with the food, but neither was it memorable. I had a cod and scampi gratin, really the only flavor it had was the lemon juice and salt that I added. The potatoes were plain and the vegetables tasted straight out of the freezer isle. My wife said the fish and chips were typical.

The restoration makes this castle interesting,"There are a lot of castles in Ireland; however this one has been restored to show its Victorian state.

Much more than expected,"When we decided to travel to Ireland it was for castles and scenic countryside. I never thought it would be a “food trip”, but wow! When I saw the prices (around €15 per entree) I assumed a mid-range quality; however, this place was better than a lot of more expensive restaurants is Italy.

Cathedral was impressive; but the cemetery was the attraction,"It is free to enter the grounds and doesn’t take long to see. If you are in the area, there is no reason not to stop and look.

"Very nice, but close to I-90","This was a great hotel. Very clean, staff was great and the room was comfortable. My only concern was how close it was to the interstate.

"Good tour, but not must-see","If you have the time while in Florence, this is a good trip to take; however, with travel time it will pretty much use up an entire day. If you are only going to be there for a couple of days and need to cut things out of your itinerary, don't feel too bad about missing out on this. The architecture is impressive, but really this boils down to a famous photo-op.

If you do go here are a couple of thoughts:
1) Get your tickets to climb the tower in advance. Entrance to the tower is limited and you may not be able to get them there.
2) Get instructions on how to get to the departure point before you go.

Very good for longer stays,"This place was nice. You could tell it was getting a bit older, new paint and carpet would have helped our unit a lot; however, it was clean and the staff was friendly. The kitchen and washer/dryer are a big plus for reducing meal cost and luggage if you are going to be on the island for more than a few days. There really isn't much of a beach on the property and nothing is within walking distance, so you need to rent a car, but that is something you probably want to do on the big island anyway. Parking was adequate for us, but I don't know what it would be like during peak tourist seasons.

Harry Potter World was nicely done (even my fan-girl wife approved) and there were plenty of rides. The only downside was a lack of shows and performers, but there was still plenty to do.",January 2012,Universal's Islands of Adventure,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d258685-Reviews-Universal_s_Islands_of_Adventure-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.5
I wish I could give this 6 stars,"I have seen the Blue Man Group here and in Vegas. The show is simply amazing. It is funny and family friendly. I strongly recommend you see them at least once, and Orlando has a very nice theater for them.",January 2012,Blue Man Group,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d660555-Reviews-Blue_Man_Group-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best part of any theme park,"They did such a great job with this, it was better than anything else I saw in Universal or Disney World.

Great place for longer stay with family,"The property was beautiful, the suite was huge and very clean, it had a kitchen and there were free laundry rooms. It would be a great place to spend a week. There was lake with a beach, 2 pools, golf, mini-golf, and all that space. Not as fancy as the Grand Cypress, but in my opinion a better value.",January 2012,Holiday Inn Club Vacations At Orange Lake Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34352-d120242-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Club_Vacations_At_Orange_Lake_Resort-Kissimmee_Florida.html,"Kissimmee, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.0
Nice but nothing special,"It was a nice hotel, but for the price it was not that great. I know Boca Raton is an expensive area, but this hotel does not justify the price tag. There was nothing wrong with it, but it was not terribly impressive.

What you would expect from Holiday Inn,"The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. It is very easy to get to from the Interstate. There was nothing special about this, it is similar to other Holiday Inns I have stayed in (meaning nice but slightly on the expensive side).",January 2012,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites - Ocala Conference Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34496-d640126-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Hotel_Suites_Ocala_Conference_Center-Ocala_Florida.html,"Ocala, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.0
Nice hotel,"I had never stayed in a Country Inn before, but was pleased. The lobby was nice. The hallway on our floor smelled strange (almost like strong body odor), but the room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. The front desk staff was friendly. The location was ok, there was not much in the immediate area. Overall good, but not great.",January 2012,"Country Inn & Suites By Radisson, Gainesville",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34242-d576899-Reviews-Country_Inn_Suites_By_Radisson_Gainesville-Gainesville_Florida.html,"Gainesville, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.5
"no frills, but clean","The room was tiny and the motel older, but it was very clean. The walls are pretty thin, I could hear the TV next door clearly. There was no one at the front desk when I went to check out, so I left my key on the table in the room and a note at the lobby entrance. I only stayed one night, I could see how the room might not be appropriate for a longer stay (due to the size). If I am ever in Herber City again, I will probably stay here due to the price.",September 2011,Mac's Motel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g57009-d1485602-Reviews-Mac_s_Motel-Heber_City_Utah.html,"Heber City, Utah",hotels,3.0,2.5
Crater diving is only a novelty,"The crater is OK for training dives and as a novelty, but not really worth it as a destination. There is not much to see. Even 1 medium size group of divers made it overly crowded. If you find yourself in Midway with nothing else to do, maybe. It cost over $20 just to be in the water for a couple of hours (that did not include any rental gear).",September 2011,The Homestead Crater,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57063-d2285763-Reviews-The_Homestead_Crater-Midway_Utah.html,"Midway, Utah",attractions,2.0,4.0
"Nice hotel, pet friendly, reasonably priced","We always stay here when we go to Denver. It is clean, allows dogs at no additional charge (there may be a refundable deposit - I don't remember), and has a great location. It is a very short drive to a shopping center that has theaters, restaurants, bars and a Dave & Busters. It is a great weekend destination in itself. It is also easy to get to Flat Irons mall from here.",January 2011,Quality Inn & Suites Westminster - Broomfield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33691-d119994-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Suites_Westminster_Broomfield-Westminster_Colorado.html,"Westminster, Colorado",hotels,4.0,3.5

Outstanding diving and chartered cruises,"The two dive/tour cruises we went on with Aqua Marine were the best two days of our trip to ST Thomas. They had a nice boat, good equipment and a great crew. It was a little more expensive than some places, but well worth the money. I would highly recommend them to anyone.",June 2011,Aqua Marine Dive Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147404-d1774832-Reviews-Aqua_Marine_Dive_Center-St_Thomas_U_S_Virgin_Islands.html,St. Thomas,attractions,5.0,5.0
