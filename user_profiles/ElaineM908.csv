Beautiful with great service,"Had an amazing stay at this hotel. We stayed in an Acropolis View suite.
The location couldn't be beat, right in the heart of Plaka and close to all the attractions.
The service was excellent and the view from our large balcony was breathtaking.
Breakfast buffet had a great selection. The pool was a bit cold and crowded, but lovely none the less.
Would definitely stay here again",October 2019,Electra Palace Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228901-Reviews-Electra_Palace_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
