A really nice Lodge - a step above the rest in Chitwan - They treat you like Royalty,We had a great time and were treated like royalty in the KGH hotel - The food was wonderful and the serve was amazing - We spend a few day in the resort just as the rest of the world were headed home (Covid-19) . Ask for bungalow room (separate units). Like all KGH hotels this place is cleaner than any other hotel I have stayed at in Nepal. Great reputation and really friendly staff. All of the activities they arranged for us were also above what I saw other hotels offering - We had a personal guide for 2 days.

3/10 based on what I would expect flight to Everest,Very late departure and staff and bus driver did not seem to know where the plane was - 1.5 hours waiting after flight time in the hot muggy bus on the tarmac - Flight eventually boarded and some of us did not even get a window seat (on a sight seeing tour???) - tiny dirty obstructed windows - we did eventually get a great view of Everest and the entire range - but not ad described and the plane was not designed for sight seeing - great cramped window shots of Everest but Id do something different if I did it again,May 2019,Yeti Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8728887-Reviews-Yeti-Airlines,World,flights,3.0,3.5

A gem in the middle of Kathmandu,"This was such a pleasant surprise - I’d say a 4 star hotel with a few Asian issues (showers are always weird and somehow incomplete in all of Asia - no exception here. Take a shower and the entire bathroom floor is soaked).

Don’t use Omnia - worst hop on off experience of my life,"When in Rome do not use the Omnia card. Most unreliable and unfriendly service in town -
1) very inconvenient offices for pick up where upsell is all they do well - terrible customer service reps and no description of service
2) maps are very poor (Rome in general has lousy street signs but Omnia maps make them worse)
3) HORRIBLE schedule - with no consistency - use the “Citysightseeing” Roma busses - I counted six to every Omnia bus. On the 15 minute schedule we waited 49 mins - finally arrived and said it was the last bust (6:30pm) don’t get stranded.
4) the most rude bus attendants - a clerk and someone else in a suite - no time for answers while they text their girlfriends.
5) headsets are too quiet with useless info. No one on any of our busses could make them worthwhile.

Stay away - even the front of the line stuff is no big deal and it takes longer to figure it out than just stand in the regular line

Overall a 2 out of 10 (the actual bus is ok) but the announcements are bad quality sound - no English at all.

“Citysightseeing” sales guys everywhere - half the cost 4-6 times the busses and they go to the same places

Pic is the bus I would use instead - wait till you arrive and but the pass in front of your hotel or on any main drag.

"One of the worst Hotels I have stayed in, in Canada. Filthy and outdated","Don't be fooled by the pictures on their site. I don't know where to begin....

(1) the first thing, it took 40 minutes for the Shuttle to arrive at post 22C, out in the freezing cold. not too bad except they said they would be there in less than 10 minutes when I called.

(2) When I arrived the front desk guy asked if I had heavy bags? I said I dont need a bell hop but thanks...""its not that sir... You are on the 12th floor, and the elevator only goes to 11.)

(3)The hall and common carpets are 10 years past their usable life, incredibly dirty hotel

(4) I know there was a hockey tournament staying at the hotel, but there were pop cans and pizza boxes on floor 11 that were there on Thursday when I arrived, and Sunday eve when I left.

(5) At 11pm when I arrive, they told me the only place nearby for food was their bar. It took ages to come, was barely OK and very expensive. Next morning I see 3 nice places just outside, all open till midnight.

(6) the rooms are so outdated and the vinyl wallpaper is literally falling off the walls plus the popcorn ceiling had been repaired poorly about 6 times.

(7) broken chair in room from the 70's I'm sure. Blinds did not work, they sent a guy with a key into my room in error, TV was very slow changing channels,

showers were nice, Heat/AC worked, free wifi, and wake up calls. Pool looked OK but I did not bother.

Seriosly the best Dinner spot on Ali'i Drive,"This little place that only sounds like it is a morning coffee spot is transformed to a white table cloth bistro each night. Truly excellent food that meets any expectation of Hawaiian atmosphere and food. We went back four times in 10 days. The owner is always on hand making sure everything is perfect and there is often very nice Live Hawaiian music.

They do not have a liquor license but that's actually a bonus. They allow you to BYOB, You can walk 1/2 a block to the ABC and buy a bottle of wine or a six pack if you are so inclined. No cork fees and they even provide wine glasses or beer chillers. A very personal and local atmosphere. This owner truly understands customer service and has perfect staff for this establishment.

"A Delta Hotel by name, but needs a serious reno","This Delta is located in a fair spot near waterfront and tons of restaurants but it is really in need of work. The rooms are small, bathrooms old and dated, not super clean and some very weird swinging doors to the bathroom. Pool and gym are OK but water temp in hot tub was tepid. The major positive was the staff, they really tried to help in any way they could but many were new and did not know the city (or that there is a Starbucks in the mall upstairs). Bar in Hotel is friendly with good food and drink. Concierge service is weak. No one really knows the city except a few favourite bars etc.... slow elevators and expensive and inconvenient parking too.
