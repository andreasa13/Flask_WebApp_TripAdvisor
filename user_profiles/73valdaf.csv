In the foot steps of St Paul.,"Great driver, great tour. Just right for an 80 year old, accompanied by daughter.
The highlight was the museum. Wonderful entrance, glass floor over ancient diggings,
Great collection, and on the upper floor, a beautiful view of the Acropolis.
Our driver was very good, and showed us the best of Athens within the timeframe we had, including where St Paul preached his sermons.
Would recommend this company highly to tourists visiting Athens on a cruise, in particular.",July 2018,JG Athens Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2173384-Reviews-JG_Athens_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
