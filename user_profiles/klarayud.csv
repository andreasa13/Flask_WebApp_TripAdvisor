Great food tour,"We booked their food tour because of the great comunication we had with them before booking. I got answers and explanatios fast. We were not disapointed. Our guide was great. She learned all the names gave explanations about the food and some history too. Was very patient with all of us and walked slowly. She gave us time to explore the big church. Was very atentive to alland not in a hurry. The tour actualy lasted more than 4 hours.
It was worth every penny.",October 2019,Alternative Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d3820406-Reviews-Alternative_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
A must for tourists,I was not sure if I wanted to go up there and see ruins but I'm happy we decided to go. If you get there early when it opens you don't have a line for the tickets and it's much more enjoyable touring the site and taking photos. It's very impressive. Makes you feel so small. The views are great too. I think that it's a must to go from there to the museum to see what they found on the acropolis.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great value for your money,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The room was a shock at first. The bathroom is a part of the room, separatet by tanted glass and the sink is in the room. We got used to it fast though. To our surprise, we got toiletier that was added as we used them and the room was cleaned and the bed straitened twice a day. The first day we got a bottle of mineral water and later 2 bars of chocolate each evening. Certainly more than needed for a 3 star hotel. Breakfast is good. We were alowed to stsrt eating 15 minutes earlier one morning when we needed to get early to meet a tourguide. The stuff was great. Very helpful and always with a smile. There is even a small room to leave the bags.
In short, it's very recomended.",October 2019,Best Western Plus Amazon Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d260275-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_Amazon_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
