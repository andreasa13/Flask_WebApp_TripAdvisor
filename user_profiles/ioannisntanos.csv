Pure joy!,What gem. Vegetarian and vegan menu with lots of choices! Amazing handmade nachos and out of this world Buddha bowls. We sat outside and enjoyed an amazing service with a smile from the owner Jay and the multilingual Edvin.

Brilliant,Excellent experience overall. Great pizzas in reasonable prices and great service. Friendly and efficient. Well spoken English too (not at all common at this part of the world).

Loved it,There is no way to make a reservation online and without speaking Italian we were hesitant to call the landline number. We just showed up on a Wednesday evening and luckily we managed to get a table as the place soon became full. We loved everything about it. Food and service were abundant and fun. The wine was not the best we ever tasted but we still drank it all. Great tastes and lots of food for a 25 euros fixed per person price.,August 2020,Agriturismo Leone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g652022-d1628391-Reviews-Agriturismo_Leone-Noto_Province_of_Syracuse_Sicily.html,"Sicily, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful,"Absolutely brilliant experience in every way. From the booking, the service and the food. Nothing was trouble and we loved everything. We had the starter and pasta of the day (tartar swordfish and inked pasta), and also marinated anchovies and Sicilian pasta. We shared a second (mixed grill). We had two beers and wine. Paid 93 euros and did not regret a single cent.

Terrible service,We asked for a table at 21:30 walking-in as we saw four empty tables outside. The waitress asked the manager's opinion. He said that there were no available tables outside (although they were four with no reservation note on them) and he could offer us a table inside. His attitude was upsetting. No effort to accommodate customers at all. The restaurant was closing at eleven and we made an online reservation (through fork app) without any issue for 10 min later (which we cancelled straight afterwards as we had no mood to give their appalling behaviour any further chance). We are certain it is covid to blame (not).,August 2020,Fratelli Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187891-d18845405-Reviews-Fratelli_Restaurant-Syracuse_Province_of_Syracuse_Sicily.html,"Sicily, Italy",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Nice but not exciting,"I feel that the main reason failed to excite me is because I have visited many major art galleries in different places. This is rather small and basic permanent exhibition but with substantial diversity so that most people will find something that speaks to them. Lowry, Dali, Picasso, Rothko, Kandinsky. However the layout is not of my taste, distracting from the exhibits (why all this metallic cages??). I always find the contemporary exhibitions far more interesting.",August 2020,Tate Liverpool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186337-d213956-Reviews-Tate_Liverpool-Liverpool_Merseyside_England.html,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.0

Cozy and authentic,"We loved the hospitality and food on a cold January night! Nice people and cozy warm environment inside.

Famous steps,This is a typical touristy restaurant at a beautiful area of Athens (anafiotika steps). As expected the food and service were average.

Food Vs Service,"Visited without a reservation and were lucky to find a table. The food was really good, but the service needs a lot of work.

Hidden gem,This is an Indian restaurant well hidden but definitely worth the effort. Living in the UK we had all kind of experience with Indian food. Here we were not disappointed.

Hmmm,"Ok. First of all we have visited numerous faves all around the world. These are not something spectacular, but they are really nice. The guiding script is good (humorous) but not much geology information. The idea of switching on/off the lights is annoying and the use of colour lights is just ridiculous.

Unacceptable,"Disgraceful in many ways apart from the views. We booked a table for two to celebrated our anniversary (big mistake!). We were greeted with indifference and shown to our table where the floor was full of cigarette butts. We ordered a bottle of wine, grilled sardines, prawns, octopus vegetables and goat cheese salad. The salad was nice but the rest was barely eatable. Everything felt cooked from frozen. We sent the prawns back (not clean and not cooked properly) and did not touch the octopus (frozen, chewy and excessively salty) and the vegetables. The view was really nice, but no effort was put to that anyway!! We paid 60 euros (they did not charge the offending prawns) and felt ripped off. Avoid!

P.S.

Do not bother,Booked one night as was coming to Chester for a gig. Overpriced and noisy with an awful view (ground floor room 22).
