Excellent!,"The place was new, fresh, with all the necessary commodities. (Always happy time see air conditioners in the south!) The location is good - it’s a nice neighborhood and about 20min walk into downtown, even faster with transportation. The communication from the hosts was fast, well mannered and always ready to help with anything we needed! Special thanks to Niko!
We were also given a free upgrade, which is always a pleasant experience.
All in all, Omnia Pagrati Apartments hosted us for a week and we couldn’t be happier with our choice!",July 2020,Omnia Pagrati Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15616761-Reviews-Omnia_Pagrati_Apartments-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0

Wonderful views,"The historical monument provides with spectacular views of the city and the water.

Was I even there?,"Had higher expectations. We came to the restaurant and no one didn’t seem to notice. Had to go ‘find the staff’ to take our order. While they were perfectly polite interacting, I just felt like they didn’t care that I was there.
On the positive side, as a tourist and a vegetarian this place gave me the chance to try a national Greek dish - moussaka.",July 2020,Veganaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4213742-Reviews-Veganaki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5

Light entertainment,"I was somehow hoping for a little more than what they had, but I don’t regret going. The exhibits were nice, but mind you it’s all physics - no magic tricks involved.

Surreal,"We had an exceptional chance to see the monument at a time with very few tourists around. A beautiful place, outstanding views, so much history around you.
Only down side was the construction work which kind of messed with the authenticity, but there’s nothing you can really do about it and I wouldn’t say that you’d necessarily have to wait until they’re done to visit.

Left wanting for more!,"As a vegetarian, it is often a struggle to dine in restaurants as even if they have vegetarian options they’re fairly limited. Jut by looking at the menu I could tell I wanted half of the things on it! We ended up having a ‘curry dish’ and and ‘mushroom pasta’ (sorry they had fancy names but I cannot remember). Regardless, the food was outstanding, the staff was very nice, location is also very easily accessible if you in the center.

"Bad service, bad food!","Ordered a mushroom pasta - there we three tiny mushroom pieces in the dish and the rest was tomato sauce and cheese. Oh, and a big chunk of plain tasteless pasta.
Speaking of the tomato sauce, the waiter spilled some on my white dress while setting it on the table!!! I got a ‘sorry’, but that’s about it.
Very disappointed in the restaurant and do not recommend, I’m sure you can find better Italian food elsewhere if your truly craving it!",July 2020,Ciao Italia - Pangrati,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d8067753-Reviews-Ciao_Italia_Pangrati-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,3.5

A must for breakfast lovers!,"Went to this place whilst in Porto and came back in Lisbon! Such an amazing place for breakfast lovers! The atmosphere and the look of the place is real nice, but the food is to die for! Although for some reason not a big fan of their coffee (americano black) - maybe it’s just the blend.

YUM,"My Portuguese friend suggested the place. The ice cream was absolutely yum! They say it’s freshly made with natural ingredients and sugars and no additional preservatives. While I have no way of confirming this, the taste did seem very natural and fresh!

Fine ride,"Oddly enough, jumped on it not realizing it was THE TRAM to be on when in Lisbon, when actually just needed to get downtown from my hotel. Not much to the experience beside the ‘tourist factor’ and a lot of people use it for everyday travel. The ticket was 3€ (I was able to buy it with the driver). Only minus - it doesn’t in any way show you the stops, so while the locals know them by heart and most tourists just get on it for the ride, I was actually looking to get to a certain stop and it was a bit of a head scratcher. Tho the driver was nice enough to tell us where to get off when I asked him.",July 2019,Tram 28,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d262792-Reviews-Tram_28-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,3.0,4.0
Adored it!,"Let’s start by saying the the entire neighborhood had an amazing vibe and this place was no exception!

A maybe,"Chose this out of what I considered to be limited selection for lunch options in Peniche due to my preferences as a vegetarian. The place was nice. Menu seemed more ‘fresh’ than the food actually turned out to be. My ‘avocado toast’ ended up having salmon, cause that’s supposedly what they usually put in it. Tho, they did apologize and re-do it, it was a wait. My sister ordered a chicken wrap - got it all, but the actual chicken. Plus the banana milkshake was 1/10 banana and thus no flavor.
We got fed, it was ok, but I won’t be coming back anytime soon.",July 2019,Celeiro Café,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608952-d13533650-Reviews-Celeiro_Cafe-Peniche_Leiria_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Peniche, Portugal",restaurants,3.0,4.5
