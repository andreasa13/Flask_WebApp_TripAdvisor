Lovely place,Had a lovely time here. The view from the caravan deck to the sea was lovely. Staff went out of their way to help and provide advice which you don’t get at some of the big national chains.

Enjoyable afternoon,"Had good weather which always helps, and generally enjoyed the afternoon there, but the number of empty enclosures and indoor attractions which were closed (for obvious safety reasons) meant it felt like an expensive day out.

Enjoyable visit,"Excellent gardens which we really enjoyed walking round. The house was very good, but some rooms and areas are in desperate need of renovation.

Only annoyance was the toilet block - it smelled awful, it wasn’t properly cleaned and was also in need of renovation.

Otherwise, it was a very enjoyable visit and we’ll be returning again!",July 2018,Brodsworth Hall and Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187067-d213501-Reviews-Brodsworth_Hall_and_Gardens-Doncaster_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
