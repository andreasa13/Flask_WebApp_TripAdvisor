Value for money in a quiet street,"The Cordellats is great if you would like to step off the noise of the main streets for a little bit.

It's small and cosy and offers good food for a decent price. We ate the day menu which includes salad, paella and sangria for EUR 12.00 per pax, so it's very budget-friendly.",October 2019,Cordellats,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187529-d8328225-Reviews-Cordellats-Valencia_Province_of_Valencia_Valencian_Country.html,"Valencia, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.5
The view is worth the climb,"We underestimated the climb up - there are 120+ stairs so be prepared and bring some water.

The reward once you climb up is worth it - an astonishing 360-degree view of Valencia.

It's only EUR 2.00, so it's a little money well spent",October 2019,Miguelete,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187529-d562017-Reviews-Miguelete-Valencia_Province_of_Valencia_Valencian_Country.html,"Valencia, Spain",attractions,4.0,4.5
Must see spot in the heart of the old city,"Plaza de la Virgen is possibly the most beautiful spot in old-town Valencia - you are surrounded by picturesque buildings, a glourious fountain and cosy little cafés.

Favourite vacation spot,"We have been staying in a caravan in Tsitreli for the years in a row. Nina ans Giannis are absolutely amazing - most of the people who stay in Tsitreli keep on returning (same as us).

The rented caravans include a fully equipped kitchenette (fridge, oven, cutlery, plates, etc.), as well as a table and 4 chairs outide the caravan. You can request a barbeque to your caravan. They provide you with sheets and towels and even offer a change every 3 days - this is something unseen as compared to other camps that make you bring your own sheets. The shared bathrooms get cleaned on daily basis.

The campsite is 50 m away from the beach and a waking distance from restaurants and cafes. The camp has its own supermarket.",May 2019,Camping Tsitreli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3236244-d4455068-Reviews-Camping_Tsitreli-Kalamitsi_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,"Kalamitsi, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Nice secluded beach,"We have been visiting this beach in late May / early June and it is a perfect secluded spot - there are no more than 10 people on the beach at a time.

Okay to visit,"The Sarafkina House is in the middle of the picturesque Gurko Str. It is an old house turned into a museums which offers and insight to 19th rich Bulgarian house.

Only two out of five floors are open to visitors. The exhibition shows a variety of everyday objects, furniture, national clothing, old photographs. It's not too grand but still a lovely place to see.

An important historical landmark,"The Tsarevets Fortress is one of the most important historical monuments in Bulgaria and of the very few castles we Bulgarians have - in this sense, it is a crutial historical landmark and a must-see.

I'd personally recommend to visit in spring due to all the blossoming trees (it looks a bit bare in winter).

You can spend a few hours just hiking the hill.",February 2019,Tsarevets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303653-d547559-Reviews-Tsarevets-Veliko_Tarnovo_Veliko_Tarnovo_Province.html,"Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria",attractions,5.0,4.5

Must-see!,"The Acropolis is a must-see historical place - it is unique with its history and has great view of the rest of the city.

The entrance for the Acropolis is EUR 20.00 which we found quite steep in comparison to the city standart. A tourist guide joked that the Greeks had to pay their external debt somehow, thus the high fee :)

You get what you (don't) pay for,"Well, you get what you pay for - if you want a cheap stay in within walking distance from everything, then this is the place for you but don't expect more than this.

It's noisy, not too clean and our bathroom was a transparent additon in the actual room, not a seperate room.

"Great location, worth the cash.","Stayokay is perfect if you would like a modest palce to stay in the heart of the city - 15 min walk from Amsterdam Centraal (direct connection to airport) and walking distance from all the main attractions.

Pros: location, clean, surprisingly quiet

Cons: disorganised - it seems that every night staff had to come and wake up people to check if they are on the correct bed (thus waking everybody up and making a hassle) which was quite annoying

Recommendation to staff: Just make sure people are on the right beds when they check in, not at 3 a.m.",September 2018,Stayokay Hostel Amsterdam Stadsdoelen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188590-d236073-Reviews-Stayokay_Hostel_Amsterdam_Stadsdoelen-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",hotels,4.0,3.5
