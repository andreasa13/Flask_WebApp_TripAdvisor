Rude staff,Been here a few times now. Were kept waiting for 25 minutes for two drinks and when we politely inquired about them they were very rude and didn’t even apologise,April 2021,B.

Great date idea,"Visited today with my boyfriend (we are 20 and 21) and absolutely loved it!! We were there for 2 hours but we spent the whole time in the natural history section; if you intend to look at everything properly definitely give yourself the whole day. We especially loved that the animals were grouped by different categories (how they hear, how they move) so you get lots of different animals next to each other, not just all the insects in one place then all the fish and so on. It was engaging and interesting all the way through, and the captions were obviously kid-friendly without being too dull for adults. Honestly love love love and would recommend for families or adults. Only one thing - needs a bigger postcard selection in the shop!!",September 2020,National Museum of Scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d2359701-Reviews-National_Museum_of_Scotland-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing,"My boyfriend and I visited last night as we were gifted a meal from a friend. He had been before but it was my first time as I’m from out of town but I was blown away by how lovely it was! Real italian pizza made to perfection and a really nice cozy atmosphere. Everyone was very friendly, especially our waiter Finley who was really welcoming and didn’t mind at all when I wanted my aperol spritz made a certain way, and even made sure we had a table by the window. Will definitely be coming again, thanks so much for a lovely evening Franco’s",August 2020,Francos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186508-d2220604-Reviews-Francos-Peebles_Scottish_Borders_Scotland.html,"Peebles, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
SCAM,"TOURISTS BEWARE: THE GREEKS WILL SCAM YOU AS MUCH AS THEY CAN. My partner and I visited the acropolis, the acropolis museum and the ancient agora today and every single one of them had different made up rules, some only accepting drivers licences, some only student cards and some only passports. One gate of the acropolis needed me to cover my shoulders and the other didn’t. They did not acknowledge the tickets we pre-paid for and forced us to buy new full price tickets. The staff at all three places were extremely rude and unhelpful. Tourists: take every possible form of ID with you, take as much to cover up with as possible and screenshot all the terms and conditions on the website as the staff will change their minds and make up rules to get as much money out of you. SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!",August 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5
Rude staff,"The sights were good and the temples were very impressive but the staff were a huge let down. They were extremely rude and wouldn’t acknowledge the pre-paid tickets my partner and I had already bought, forcing us to purchase even more at full price. They were also very rude and abrupt when telling you where to walk as the paths are not clear at all. The plaques explaining the exhibits are boring and only explain the way they were put together, nothing about what the buildings and things were used for or represented. I’m lucky my partner is an archaeologist so we weren’t at a total loss but I would definitely say to the average person to purchase a guide book as otherwise it is very boring and confusing, not laid out in an interesting way at all. Also there is construction machinery everywhere. Only worth it for the temples at the top of the hill and the views. Also don’t go in the middle of the day as there is almost no shade. If you are a tourist, be insistent and don’t let them scam you out of more money, which they will try to do.",August 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,1.0,4.5
