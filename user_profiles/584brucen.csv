Average but we enjoyed the regency club,"My wife and I stayed here for a week in March, 2020.

Pros:

(1). Well located and within walking distance of many sights or mass transit.

(2). Good Regency club with a nice view, breakfast and evening appetizers.

(3). Service at the Regency Club was very good, especially chef Nana.

(4). Housekeeping was excellent. They changed sheets daily without our asking.

Con:

(1). The suite is not a true suite; it is simply a larger room with a better bathroom. The view was nice but the balcony was unusable as it was so noisy.

(2). Bell service was not good. We arrived at 9pm and no one offered to help us with our bags when we got out f the private transport from the airport.

(3). I understand the need to be socially conscious but the large bottles of soap, shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom were difficult to use.

I am glad that the price dropped on my reservation as it was not worth $265USD per night.",March 2020,Hyatt Regency Sydney,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255060-d256541-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",hotels,3.0,4.0
My wife loved it!,"Wife and I came here and she loved the local vendors and their products. She bought an expensive leather bag, jewelry and other things while I sat and waited.

Beautiful building,"I was very impressed with the building and it’s remodel into a shopping venue. The building is beautiful, well preserved and impressive. The vendors and shops were primarily on the higher end so it was okay to look but not buy.

Good but not great,Wife and I stopped here for lunch since it’s so close to our hotel. I ordered the souvlaki and she ordered the moussaka. The lamb souvlaki was very tasty but cooked well done which I hate. It was not tender and it was difficult to cut or chew. My wife’s moussaka was very good. There was a large party next to us that was very noisy and made the dining atmosphere less than ideal,March 2020,Medusa Greek Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d1099396-Reviews-Medusa_Greek_Taverna-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Small but a It of high quality vendors,"We go to farmers markets wherever we are. We found the Carriageworks to be on the smaller side but the quality of the vendors and products were top notch. We bought figs, crumpets, meat pie and several baked goods. Everything was excellent. My only complaint is that there should be a designated covered area to sit and eat your food. The areas provided were much too small.",March 2020,Carriageworks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d2258217-Reviews-Carriageworks-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Excellent food,"Stopped here for lunch and were absolutely giddy at the quality of the food. My wife ordered the mussels (she loves them) in a marinara sauce. They were huge, plump and numerous. She was so happy. I ordered the lunch special of fish and chips for $18AUD and what the best fish and chips I have ever eaten. The cod was huge but perfectly done and moist, delicate and delicious.

Good ramen but not fantastic,"Wife and I had a late lunch here to evade the crowd. I had the shoyu ramen (which they are know for) and my wife had the miso ramen. The shoyu ramen had a lot of flavor -- a lot of fish flavor with a layer of pork, but not salty. The miso ramen had a strong miso flavor but not overly so and not salty. Both were very good but not as good as Tsujita which sadly is no longer at Yokocho.",November 2019,Baikohken,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60982-d12658692-Reviews-Baikohken-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Great value at lunch for kamaaina,"For kamaaina, it is 50% off their lunch special. The lunch special is a choice of soup or salad, and a choice of pasta (approximately 6 choices) or pizza (again, approximately 6 choices). My wife chose the squid ink pasta and I chose the tobiko pasta with calamari. Both were excellent and probably the best squid ink pasta we have ever had. They used a lot of squid ink in the pasta but it was not salty; just a tremendous amount of flavor. My tobiko pasta with calamari was also good but not as good as the squid ink pasta. Also got a comped dessert (tiramisu) because we were celebrating my birthday and that was also very tasty. All in all, a great value for an excellent lunch.",November 2019,Arancino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60982-d1825766-Reviews-Arancino-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great Happy Hour!,"Our first night in Waikiki we had a happy hour at Basalt. Had the moscow mule ($6), hamburger ($6) and french fries ($2). All were excellent and a great value.

Best Udon in Honolulu,"My wife and I had lunch here and thought it was the best udon we have had in Honolulu. Beats Marukame Udon, Jimbo or Sekiya. I had the sukiyaki udon and my wife had the nabeyaki udon with the fat udon noodles (you are given a choice of skinny or fat noodles). Both were excellent and so filling.

Good location; nice property,"Wife and I stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel was previously an office tower renovated into a hotel. They did a good job on the renovation. As a globalist, I was upgraded to a suite which was really a large room with 2 queen beds and a sofa bed. The room was spacious and roomy. The bathroom was well done -- a wet room with shower and tub, and a Toto (Japanese) toilet washlet. My only complaint was that the lighting was poor in the bathroom. Bedding was comfortable and the room was quiet. Housekeeping did a good job daily.

Breakfast was limited; there is a small buffet ($24) and no ala carte menu.

Service was exceptional. Our check in with Tiare was the best we have had at a Hyatt property and that includes Grand Hyatt and Park Hyatt. Tiare went out of her way to show us 2 different rooms for our selection. I wish all employees were as customer oriented as she was.

For our purposes, Hyatt Centric is the perfect hotel. It is so well located that it is just a short walk to many fine restaurants and shopping. We are making this our ""go to"" hotel in Waikiki.",November 2019,Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60982-d10728599-Reviews-Hyatt_Centric_Waikiki_Beach-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",hotels,5.0,4.5

Fantastic stay!,"My wife and I stayed at Park Hyatt Mendoza for 8 nights and had a great time. The hotel is beautiful and well located across the street from Independence Plaza. It is in walking distance of the best areas of Mendoza.

We had a corner suite which was very spacious. The living area of the suite had 2 sofas, side chair, a dining table with seating for 6, a desk, and a toilet and bidet. The bedroom had a king bed, lounge chair and ottoman. The bathroom had a toilet, bidet, shower and the closet. The closet was small -- they should have designed a walk in closet and taken space from the living area. Housekeeping was excellent and the suite was kept in great condition. My only complaint is that they should have a USB port on or near the nightstands in the bedroom.

We had free breakfast every morning as a globalist member. Breakfast was tasty and there was a good selection of hot dishes, cold dishes and baked goods on the buffet.

My only complaint for the hotel was check in as it took me a long time to check in. There should be a separate area for check in by elite members. There was no line management -- there should have been a line set up or hotel personnel directing the line to check in.

Shout out to Lucas Gimenez, manager of the hotel -- he went the extra mile to make our stay great. He took the time to introduce himself to us at check in and welcome us to the hotel. He later granted us an extended check out time so that we could stay in our suite until we had to leave for the airport (our flight was schedule to leave at 2AM). Greatly appreciated.",November 2019,Park Hyatt Mendoza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312781-d306559-Reviews-Park_Hyatt_Mendoza-Mendoza_Province_of_Mendoza_Cuyo.html,"Mendoza, Argentina",hotels,5.0,4.5
Wonderful dinner at a great price,"We were staying at the Park Hyatt and looking for somewhere close by for dinner. This restaurant is 1 block from the hotel and we got there at opening (7PM) and got a table in the open courtyard. We started with a carpaccio appetizer which was simple but delicious. I had the spaghetti with seafood which was different from other seafood spaghetti that I have had. This dish had 3 mussels and 1 large shrimp -- not much seafood -- but the seafood taste was all in the sauce, which was fantastic. My wife had a trio of pasta and each was equally great. With a bottle of wine, our total bill was less than $50! A great meal at a great price. This was probably our best meal in Mendoza.",November 2019,Francesco Barbera Ristorante,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312781-d1018454-Reviews-Francesco_Barbera_Ristorante-Mendoza_Province_of_Mendoza_Cuyo.html,"Mendoza, Argentina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great value,My wife and I came here for a 1 hour massage. The spa is located in an office building on the 3rd floor. The space is small but adequate. The treatment rooms were clean but sparse. The therapist was very professional and I really enjoyed my hour long massage. It was only 600 pesos ($10 USD) for the hour long massage so it was definitely a great value. We would definitely come back the next time we are in Mendoza.,November 2019,Spa Kwanying,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312781-d13901089-Reviews-Spa_Kwanying-Mendoza_Province_of_Mendoza_Cuyo.html,"Mendoza, Argentina",attractions,4.0,4.0

Disappointing Market,"We have been to many markets in Italy, Spain, France and Portugal.

Wonderful time at a great hotel,"My wife and I spent 9 nights at Park Hyatt Buenos Aires to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. The hotel is very well maintained and beautiful. It is located in Recoleta and perfectly fits the neighborhood. The hotel is within easy walking distance of many fine restaurants and bars. Our corner suite was spacious and very comfortable. Housekeeping did an excellent job daily. As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, the manager provided complimentary sparkling wine and chocolate dipped strawberries— very nice touch.

Service was efficient. Joel, who manned the doors at the Posadas entrance to the hotel, was exceptional. Joel noticed that we were upset because our tour company failed to pick us up for our dinner and tango show for the 2nd time. Joel took the initiative to determine the problem and then got the concierge involved, who contacted the tango show and got the tour company to pick us up. Very impressed with Joel and the concierge; they are exceptional employees.

As a globalist we had free breakfast and we ate in both the Gioia restaurant and Piano Nobile. Breakfast on the terrace of Piano Nobile overlooking the gardens will be something we will never forget. Food quality was excellent. In fact, even room service was excellent; had the best cheeseburger ever from room service.

The tour and Antonella were wonderful,"My wife and I had a wonderful time on the Palermo tour with Antonella. We visited 3 restaurants— first for choripan, next for empanadas and then for steak, and at each establishment, the wine flowed freely. We were joined on the tour by 3 gentlemen, and they were excellent company and conversation was easy and comfortable. In addition, German, another tour guide, joined our group because his customers did not show up for their tour. So we had 2 guides for our tour. Antonella was very personable, knowledgeable, engaging and a wonderful guide for the afternoon. My wife and I do a food tour in every international city we visit, and this is one of the best tours we have been on. What we liked about this tour besides Antonella, was the selection of restaurants. They selected neighborhood restaurants with great food that we would not have otherwise found on our own.

Great neighborhood restaurant,"My wife and I had lunch here with a local Argentine who recommended the restaurant I had the New York strip steak which was tender, tasty and a perfect medium rare.

The highlight of our trip to Argentina,"We booked an all day tour and couldn’t be happier with the entire experience. We flew on the first flight from Buenos Aires and were met at the airport by our guide, Eduardo. He gave us an overview of the national park and laid out the plans for the day. We first went to Devil’s Throat, then took the lower trail, and finally the upper trail in the park. It was a beautiful sunny day in the park but not close to being as impressive as the various waterfalls. After a long day of hiking, Eduardo took us to a nice buffet lunch for food, relaxation and recuperation. After lunch Eduardo took us back to the airport for our return flight to bueno Aires. We learned a lot and enjoyed ourselves immensely. Eduardo was a fantastic guide — engaging, thoughtful, friendly, knowledgeable and personable.

Although we did not make reservations, we were quickly seated in a booth with a nice view of the water. We split a langostino crudo with a citrus sauce and a touch of limoncello — interesting and woke our tastebuds for our entrees. My wife ordered the seafood lasagna with squid ink. It was ver good although a little light on seafood. I ordered the spaghetti del mare which had a lot of seafood and linguine. The tomato sauce was light and sweet — probably San Marzano tomatoes.

Great Location but Housekeeping was Terrible,"Stayed here for 9 nights.

PRO:

(1) Location was great. It is a 2 block walk to the subway station. There are numerous restaurants and bars within a 2 block radius for cheap and good Asian food.

(2) Pricing was reasonable when compared to other New York hotels.

(3) Free shuttle to/from LGA airport.

(4) Hotel manager was excellent in that he took personal responsibility for poor housekeeping and was very apologetic and pro-active.

CON:

(1) Housekeeping is evidently outsourced to an independent company. We were here for 9 nights and for 7 of those nights, housekeeping did something wrong. Don't they use a checklist to make sure everything has been done? One night its missing towels; 2 nights its missing toiletries; another night failed to change out the glasses and coffee mugs; 2 nights failed to clean the room.

(2) Breakfast was standard Hyatt Place fare but they over cooked the scrambled eggs every morning.

However, good value for the money.",June 2019,Hyatt Place Flushing/LaGuardia Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g47729-d5298080-Reviews-Hyatt_Place_Flushing_LaGuardia_Airport-Flushing_Queens_New_York.html,"Flushing, New York",hotels,3.0,4.5
Good hotel but not up to Grand Hyatt standards,"We stayed here for 10 nights in March. As a Globalist, I used an upgrade certificate to get a suite. The suite was spacious and well designed. There was a bathroom off of the entry way in addition to the main bathroom adjacent to the bedroom. A couch, comfortable chair, coffee table, end table, and circular dining table were in the main living area of the suite. The bathroom was large with a large walk in shower. Wine infused toiletries were very nice. As the hotel was recently renovated, everything appeared new and clean. Towels were exceptional -- fluffy, large and clean. It was very disappointing that although they had a coffee machine in the room, there was a charge per pod for coffee. Even low level Holiday Inn properties provide free coffee in-room.

Breakfast was provided every morning in the top floor restaurant. The buffet was generous but the selections never changed. We were here for 10 nights and it got very boring. One waitress, Maria, was exceptional. She was very attentive, friendly and always smiling. An exceptional employee.

We went looking for the Regency Club and found that it was a portion of the lobby bar. They separated a portion of the lobby bar for Globalists and others who have club access. Very disappointing when compared to Regency Clubs in other Grand Hyatts. The lobby area can be very noisy and not very conducive to having a peaceful drink in the evening. It would be better if they used a portion of the 10th floor restaurant (where they serve breakfast in the morning) as it would be quieter and provide a nice view. The appetizers that were served (cold cuts, nuts, cheese) were under whelming.

As noted in other reviews, the hotel is not located in the best area. It is a minimum 15 minute walk to the metro through a very sketchy area with many sex clubs. Wife and I walked one morning but she refused to walk the area thereafter. At least central Athens is a short cab ride away.

Service was spotty. Check in was very good; fast, friendly and efficient. Everything I wanted after travelling almost 24 hours to get to Athens. Room service menu was limited (there were no Greek entrees) and very expensive. Wife and I were too tired to go out for dinner the first night after 24 hours of travel so we ordered 2 pasta dishes from room service. The pasta was bland, without taste and cost us 42 Euros!

"If you like mussels, this is the place to go",Wife and I had 2 Mussels pinxto and afried baby squid. Wonderful! Lot of meaty mussels in each dish; one garlic dish and the other in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. The baby squid was perfect; lighlt battered and fried so the freshness was still highlighted. Mayonnaise and a slight hot sauce was added that made it so tasty. Place gets crowded so best to go when they open.,March 2019,La Mejillonera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187457-d2399593-Reviews-La_Mejillonera-San_Sebastian_Donostia_Province_of_Guipuzcoa_Basque_Country.html,"San Sebastian - Donostia, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.0

The BEST!,"wife and I had lunch here and tried the tripe appetizer and oxtails entree. Both were the best we have ever had (and we have had a lot of both). It’s tough to get a table without a reservation but we came 15 minutes before they opened and we’re able to score a table. We also had Pintxos on 2 separate days here and they were all excellent. Pintxo bar area can get very crowded so if you don’t like fighting the crowd, get here early.",March 2019,Gandarias Jatetxea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187457-d2148045-Reviews-Gandarias_Jatetxea-San_Sebastian_Donostia_Province_of_Guipuzcoa_Basque_Country.html,"San Sebastian - Donostia, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Quality airport hotel,"Stayed here overnight before an early morning flight. Airport shuttle is excellent— on time, clean, helpful.

Good food and value,Wife nd I had our first meal in San Sebastián at this restaurant. It was a good introduction to basque food. We had the grilled octopus and grilled rib eye steak. Both were delicious although I thought the steak could have been better salted/seasoned.

We loved the tour!,"Our guide, Kris, gave my wife and I a wonderful 3 hour Pintxos tour in the old city. We visited 3 places and had wine and 2 types of Pintxos at each stop. She ordered the best Pintxos at each stop, many of which were not on the bar and only ones that a local would know. Kris is very personable, friendly, enthusiastic and entertaining. I’m glad we took the tour early in our stay so that we can revisit the bars or explore other bars recommended by Kris.",March 2019,San Sebastian Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187457-d23132346-Reviews-San_Sebastian_Adventures-San_Sebastian_Donostia_Province_of_Guipuzcoa_Basque_Cou.html,"San Sebastian - Donostia, Spain",attractions,5.0,5.0

Excellent tour,"We did a day tour to Delphi with Key Tour. We were very happy with the tour and the value of the tour. Our tour guide, Kostas, was excellent. He was very knowledgeable as he studied archeology at the University of Athens. They gave sufficient time at each of the stops so we did not feel rushed. My only complaint is that they did not notify me what time they would pick us up at our hotel. The tour started at 8:30 and I expected to be picked up at around that time. We were very surprised when the driver arrived at 7:40 to pick us up. We hurriedly dressed and ran downstairs.

So good that we went there 3 days in a row!,"It is a neighborhood Taverna with great food and prices. Service is friendly and prompt. The restaurant was recommended to us by our tour guide and it was fabulous. We were looking for local Greek food and this place hit it out of the park! Best dish was their Moussaka — simply devine.

The tour started at 8:30am and I assumed they would pick us up sometime after that. They arrived at our hotel at 7:40 to pick us up and tKe us to the main office.

Good Malay food,"The restaurant is in the Suria KLCC shopping mall which is near the Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur where we were staying. We went to Madam Kwan's on a Monday for lunch and it was very busy with office workers and tourists which made for a very noisy atmosphere. Contrary to other reviews, service was efficient and prompt even though they were busy. We had the mixed Malaysian Satay and Hokkien fried noodles. The Satay was tender and tasty with the peanut sauce. The Hokkien fried noodles had an excellent depth of flavor without being salty. Prices were reasonable for being in a high end mall.",October 2018,Madam Kwan's KLCC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298570-d839307-Reviews-Madam_Kwan_s_KLCC-Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
WOW! Best Hyatt experience we have ever had,"We returned home yesterday from our 9-night stay at Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur and still are in awe of the GHKL, the food, the premises and most of all, its staff. We have stayed at many Hyatt properties in the world – GH Hong Kong, GH Singapore, GH Macau, GH Bangkok, GH Seoul, GH Fukuoka, Andaz Tokyo, Park Hyatt Vienna, Park Hyatt Saigon, HR Kyoto, etc. – and we can enthusiastically say that the GHKL is the best Hyatt property we have visited.

Our first impression as we entered the property was the bell persons opening the door, quickly retrieving our bags from the taxi and guiding us to the 39th floor lobby. There, we were struck by the awesome night views of the Petronas Towers from the check in area. We were efficiently checked in, then led to our suite by the assistant manager on duty. We were upgraded to a suite and when we opened the door to the suite we were awestruck by the size, layout, styling, floor to ceiling windows and views from the suite. The bathroom layout with its extra large, 2-person, circular soaking tub was spectacular. They also provided us with complimentary fresh fruit, cookies and nuts – very nice touch after a long day of travelling.

We visited the Grand Club Lounge the 2nd night of our stay and went there every night thereafter because the food, service and views were exceptional. Our compliments to chef Rolf (who we were lucky to meet) as the food was varied, excellent in taste and presentation. The food was by far the best we have ever had in a Grand Club Lounge in the world! We especially loved the sea bass which we have never had in any other Hyatt property. We enjoyed breakfast every morning at THIRTY8 where the food was equally excellent but with a larger selection. We really loved the nasi lamak, dim sum and chinese noodles offered at the breakfast buffet. We were greeted every evening by the fantastic club lounge staff. They are all friendly, customer oriented and they made my wife and I feel very much welcomed, comfortable and at ease. Kudos to Kathryna, Peggy, Hameeth, Lysia, Ash, Jing Yi, Belle and Li Yean for their excellent service!

Unfortunately, our 9-night stay came to an end but not without the club lounge staff thoughtfully giving us a going away gift. We had some of the wonderful pineapple pastries with our tea this morning at home but it made us sad that we weren't sitting in our suite at GHKL. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and it was memorable because of GHKL and the staff at GHKL.",October 2018,Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298570-d3436966-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Kuala_Lumpur-Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Very busy but good food,"We waited an hour to get seated on a busy Saturday. We have been to other branches of Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore but wanted to try them in their home country. Food was consistent with our past visits. The Xiao Long Bao was very tasty. The drunken chicken was the best we have had at any restaurant. We also tried their beef noodle soup which was tasty but not as good as what we had at Yong Kang Beef Noodle several days later. Overall, very good food but I won’t wait an hour next time.",October 2018,Din Tai Fung (101 Branch),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g13808515-d2244808-Reviews-Din_Tai_Fung_101_Branch-Xinyi_District_Taipei.html,"Xinyi District, Taipei",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Xiao long boa and hand pulled noodles were great,"The xiao long bao here is better than Din Tai Fung as the soup is tastier and the wrapper thinner than at Din Tai Fung. We also had the hand pulled noodles in their signature pork bone soup with grilled pork belly, which was at the same time rich yet light and full of flavor. The noodle texture was al dente. We were extremely happy with the food and we didn’t have to wait an hour to get seated like at Din Tai Fung.",October 2018,Paradise Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g13808515-d9566062-Reviews-Paradise_Restaurant-Xinyi_District_Taipei.html,"Xinyi District, Taipei",restaurants,5.0,4.0
