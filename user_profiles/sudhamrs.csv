Worth the long walk and climb up the hill,"Going to Acropolis in the winter was a blessing. The weather was not cold at all, just a sweater and it was perfect. We went early in the morning just before the Acropolis opened so there were no crowds. Our Tour Manager mentioned that in summer there are line up to even get in and taking pics then becomes difficult for tourists.

Also with the crowds there are lots of pickpockets in summer so we had real relief.

Even though we were told that the climb is tough and difficult which really deterred me, I decided to go with the mindset that if I could not cope with the climb, I would get back and sit in the vehicle.

Everyone who is in Athens should definitely visit the Acropolis. It may seem just like pillars if you go without a guide and do not get the background of the place but the history is very interesting and the views are what you will not get from anywhere else in the city.

Enjoy your trip with this, walk slowly and make some stops along the way and for sure you will be fine and will be able to go up the hill.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Go only if you enjoy walking - not much to see,"I was a bit disappointed with what I saw. Very large and impressive but my expectation was more along palaces in Asia and this is a different perspective. A lot of history so either you have time to read up or hire a guide to get in-depth if that is what you are interested in.

We went in the afternoon and were too tired with the long walks",November 2019,Topkapi Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293974-d294547-Reviews-Topkapi_Palace-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",attractions,4.0,4.5
Visit if you are close by,I was a bit disappointed with this one since I expected more than what I saw. I would not make special effort to drive up there but might be worth a stop and pictures if you are driving by.,November 2019,The Temple of Artemis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293976-d318896-Reviews-The_Temple_of_Artemis-Selcuk_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Selcuk, Turkey",attractions,3.0,3.5
Worth the visit if you are in the area,I am not a Catholic but I still felt welcome and some kind of peace visiting Virgin Mary's home.
