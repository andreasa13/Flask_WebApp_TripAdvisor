"sushi good (not great), take outs served before table guests","Disappointing. We were there on a reservation for a birthday dinner, party of 6. Appetizers were served quickly. Tempura veggies were bland, as was dipping broth served with them. Sushi was good but far from the best I've had. Staff seemed very disorganized. It took a ridiculously long time to get our sushi. After the third person in our group asked about the delay we were advised they had ""a lot of take out orders"". I would think the guests who are actually IN your restaurant would be your priority. Also they did nothing to recognize the birthday.",December 2019,Domo Sushi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51048-d5990419-Reviews-Domo_Sushi-Toledo_Ohio.html,"Toledo, Ohio",restaurants,3.0,4.0

good food and drink,This spot was close to our Airbnb and we liked the neighborhood feel. Food was very good although more pricey than many similar meals we had.

bad food and service,"Not sure where all of these good reviews are coming from! We ate our most expensive and worst tasting meal here. Almost everything on their grilled seafood platter was flavorless and oddly textured. The wait staff never stopped back to ask how the food was, which would have been obvious to a good waiter after seeing how much food we left on the platter.

Sunset cruise,"My sister and I enjoyed the relaxed sunset cruise. Raki and fruit were a nice treat and all of the staff we encountered were very friendly. Beautiful spot to enjoy and photograph the sunset, and lovely to see the harbor all lit up on our journey back to the dock. One large concern tho - when I asked where the life jackets were located, well into the cruise, the response I received was ""why, are you afraid?"". I realize that this was a short cruise just into the harbor, but I have NEVER been on any type of boating activity during which the crew didn't give at least a brief safety presentation.Also, never saw a life jacket!",September 2019,Manoscruises - Ferryman Boat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189415-d17591765-Reviews-Manoscruises_Ferryman_Boat-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,4.0,5.0

Unplanned delight,"On the way to the Amalia hotel pickup for a different 2 day tour my sister's passport was stolen on the metro. We are so grateful to Chat tours for rescheduling us for this tour later that day, and another to Delphi the next day! And for their assistance in obtaining a new passport. This tour was well organized, Dora our guide was lovely. We enjoyed the scenic drive along the coast and the beautifully dramatic location of the temple! We felt we had just the right amount of time to explore and absorb the history! On a side note, after reading other reviews I would definitely recommend meeting any tour at the Amalia if at all possible, rather than being picked up elsewhere. Why make the pickup rounds on the bus when you can be walking around Athens seeing other sites?

Must see!,"I can't imagine being in Athens without going here! Spectacular site, awesome views! We arrived midmorning on 21 September; crowded but not unbearably so. It was very breezy that day and we witnessed several people losing their hats! Wear sturdy shoes with good grip- some spots can be quite slippery.

Highlight of our trip to Greece,"On the way to the hotel pick up location for a 2 day tour my sister's passport was stolen on the metro so we had to cancel that tour. We are SO grateful to Chat tours for immediately rescheduling us on 2 other tours, including this one! And for their assistance with obtaining a new passport. Delphi is an amazing place to visit and our tour was made even better by our guide Effie. She shared her extensive knowledge clearly and with delightful wit, even during the bus ride there and back!

unexpected delight!,Went here on advice of hotel staff. We were a bit skeptical when we saw the generic building exterior and the laminated menu but this place was great! Very friendly waitress.

"""There's a story about that...""","My mother (78) and I(53) went on the 6 day railtour and had a great time! Don't usually go for tours but thought this would be a good way to get a feel for our first time there. The 6 day tour is actually a combination of several shorter tours, so we got to meet new travelers and guides during the trip - fun! LOVED that we saw so many BEAUTIFUL places in one trip, and we have special memories from each of them. We did need to catch up on our rest after returning home, tho! All of the guides were good, but our favorite was our guide for the first few days, Brandon. He shared so much of his knowledge, was attentive to everyone's needs, and was just an all-around pleasure! Many times as we were riding in a coach he would point something out and say ""there's a story about that...."" and proceed to share the story - always entertaining! His love for the culture and history of Ireland was evident.

"good location, TINY shower","Hotel was centrally located, so easy to get to via bus from airport and great for sightseeing in the city. Room was nice enough, small and clean but the shower was TINY. An obese person could seriously not fit into it! Expect street noise; nice that they provide ear plugs! Ask to NOT be in a room on the alley side as it sounded like beer keg bowling every morning!

very nice hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a tour package, and had booked an additional night prior to travel. Annoyingly, we were not allowed to stay in the same room for the third night, apparently because of the price difference of which I was unaware at time of booking. I asked to remain in the less expensive room for the third night and to receive partial reimbursement but this request was denied. I must say that both rooms were comfortable and clean, but the ""non-tour"" room was gorgeous! Spa luxury type bath as well!

loved the lesson on how to make a proper Irish coffee,"This was a fun evening, like visiting Dublin with a friend who knows the good places to go. This was my first food tour, so I can't compare to similar tours. I liked that we experienced what I would call ""modernized traditional"" Irish food. At our last stop we had a lesson on how to properly make (and drink!) an Irish coffee, which was great! Our guide was friendly and shared some great knowledge of Dublin city and the food scene there.

dirty towel in bathroom/charge for airport shuttle,"Room was OK but no fridge. Appeared clean until I shut the bathroom door and found a used towel hanging on the hook behind the door - yuck!

If you're advertising as an ""airport"" hotel, most folks are expecting a complimentary shuttle to the terminal. Also shuttle stopped running at 10:30pm.
