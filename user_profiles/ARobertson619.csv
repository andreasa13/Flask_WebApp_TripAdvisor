Worth seeing!,"Beautiful building, prime location, clean and modern..... 5€ entry.
Inside, as you’d expect, relic after relic of history......
Large cafe/restaurant and gift shops.....
Beware of the marble steps/walkways (as in many places in Athens!) when raining - lethal!
You could spend hours in here, if you are so inclined, or simply stroll slowly around, appreciating that these things have been found and preserved, in an otherwise ‘non ancient feeling city’.......",January 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Must see!,"We got there at 3pm on 31 Dec! Yes, there was still a queue for the ticket office (people arguing with the one sole lady there about whether they were students or not, expecting a discount, which held the queue up even longer!) but once up the hill, it was everything we dreamed of, and more, just as the sun was setting! We took amazing photos which will be treasured forever..... YES, YOU MUST SEE THIS - bucket list material, for sure.....
The rest of our stay (2 days) was disappointing to say the least - Athens is totally covered in graffiti EVERYWHERE! No real sense of an ancient city - apart from the odd ruin here and there (which looks like it just happens to be ‘blocked off’ and forgotten about)...... doing a hop on hop off bus tour on the 1st jan (as there was nothing open at all!) only depressed us to be honest - we were glad we got the highlight done in high spirits the day before!
A city easily covered in a couple of days stay, I’d say.......",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fantastic stay!,"We stayed here for 2 nights over New Year - 3 rooms booked, all with views of the Parthenon.....
Spotlessly clean,very modern style, beautifully refurbished. 10 mins walk to the sights, museum, cute souvenir shops and cafe/restaurants.....
But the highlight was the service we received here - every gentleman we met at the reception (in the boutique shop) was polite, so helpful, accommodating and cheery, at all times of the day! Well done!

Absolutely amazing stay!,"We stayed here for 3 nights as our kick off to our ‘30th anniversary trip’.....
Absolutely blown away by our welcome and the attention to detail throughout our stay....
Barbara ensured a warm welcome to every guest arriving, and following each and every gorilla trip out - welcomed back by hot towels, a cool drink, and boot cleaning service..... fantastic.....
The meals were always a delight, 3 courses both lunchtime and evening....
Personal housemaid, and waiter, who were there for any of our needs....
We had a meal served to us on our terrace, on our special day - idyllic setting in our cottage, away from everyone.......
only downside, yes, it is a steep climb up the many steps to the hotel from the car park - and Barbara did explain that they had stretchers and porters waiting for us on arrival should we really have needed that service (which we declined) but a golf buggy system would soon be in place, for future guests....
Amazing stay - were welcomed with open arms and were made to feel at home....
Simply perfect!
Couldn’t recommend this lodge more highly.....
Thank you one and all for making our special anniversary even more special.....",June 2019,Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g12120944-d951038-Reviews-Sabyinyo_Silverback_Lodge-Kinigi_Musanze_District_Northern_Province.html,"Kinigi, Rwanda",hotels,5.0,5.0
Mmmmmm.......,"We spent the night this weekend while visiting for a concert....
The only thing going for this hotel is it’s location - city centre......
Other than that - checked in by a grumpy receptionist - when we visited our room, was given a twin room - when swapped to what we asked for, a double room - again a twin room.. we gave up! Dated, really dated decor.....
morning was a delight - no hot water for a shower, and then the ‘communal breakfast’ was reminiscent of a hostel experience.....
won’t be back!

Absolute must see!,"We visited the prison recently.... and wow!
I’m not normally into doing ‘history tours’ and hate the old headphones experience, but from the get go I was captured! The whole experience left us enthralled.... from the authentic recordings of the staff involved, to the ‘smells’ of each department we walked into, culminating in the encounter with Jackie in the gift shop at the end of the tour, who then answered all our questions with great enthusiasm.... he signed his book for me, and, inspired by the whole experience, I went home and read it entirely that evening!
Wow! What a great ambassador to the prison!

Good home cooking!,"We ended up here on recommendation, once we found out that the crossroads cafe nearly has been shut down!
It didn’t disappoint! Basic, standard menu, but when the food came it was delicious!
We even made room for the Eve’s pudding and sticky toffee pudding, both with custard!

Shut down!,"Made a trip to Buckie yesterday, and on recommendation of this cafe, we sought it out....
Only to pass it on the street with ‘shut down’ signs on it!
We happened upon it with the doors open, so we hesitantly made to go in, only to be shouted at behind our back by presumably the owner stating ‘we’re closed!’.....
I asked ‘for today, or permanently?’..... ‘for good!’ Came the abrupt reply!

Worst tour I’ve ever been on!,"We booked online for this tour - as a final treat of the school holidays for an excited bus mad 8 year old boy - only to find once we arrived in inverness that the ‘red open topped bus’ broke down a week ago, and was replaced with a ‘silver mini coach with curtains!’
We went on, regardless.... only to hear the driver (who will be discussed later on) to be offering half price discounts to other hop on hop off tourists BECAUSE it wasn’t the red bus, as advertised - but he accepted our online booking when we got on, no problem, and said nothing!!
The ‘tour’ took in the front of the castle, the car park of the leaving point for Loch Ness tours, industrial estates, the back of the castle, a general sweeping statement as to where Culloden moor is situated, and an in-depth explanation about the M&Co building, which burnt down last year!!! Eh, what???
The driver... Sam his name was, on the 13.30 bus leaving the station - spent his time drawning on, in a strong Glaswegian accent barely understandable even for Scottish people on board, far less the French and American tourists.... he made frequent references to how he was the ‘happiest’ bus driver around, suggestive references to being ‘out on the razz’ and if, when a customer coughed, he could help him out as ‘he always has a bottle of whisky on him, for such emergencies’.....!!!
I do hope that the other foreigners on board really did NOT understand what was being said - as it gave the stereotypical image of a drunk loudmouth Scotsman spouting forth, and not really being funny at all!! With children on board, it was all too much to handle!
On ending the tour - which really left us with no desire to ‘hop off’ anywhere really, I asked a really nice girl about a reimbursement for the cost of our tickets, which she said was out of her hands and couldn’t do anything about it!
Surely after almost a week of the ‘red open top bus’ being out of commission, then SOMETHING should’ve been written on the website that it will be a boring small coach as a replacement - if it had been, we wouldn’t have made the effort to drive to inverness, only to let an 8 year old down terribly!",August 2018,City Sightseeing Inverness Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g186543-d11446486-City_Sightseeing_Inverness_Hop_On_Hop_Off_Bus_Tour-Inverness_Scottish_Highlands_Sc.html,"Inverness, United Kingdom",activities,1.0,3.5
"First escape room, ever! Amazing!","We did the Egyptian experience this weekend - as I said, only one out of the 4 of us had ever done one, and I personally was quite sceptical about being ‘enclosed’ and under a time clock.... but the whole experience was very enjoyable, well thought out, a lot more intense than I thought it would be and very well made! Clever, artistic sisters!
Will certainly be back to do the other rooms at some point, and won’t be afraid to accept the challenge of escape rooms again!

Mmmm... strange place!,"We were staying in the area for a 3 night break in another private apartment, and this Inn was the only place to eat nearby, so we had no choice....
Immediately on entering, I felt it was a strange set up - a gorgeous stone fireplace on one side, which sadly was not lit, with armchairs around it, but with a huge tv screen there too.... tables in between, then at the other end was a snooker table....
This gave the strange feeling of a modern sports bar all over, given the tv and snooker at either ends, and children running around- but then the menu we thought was ‘fine dining’ standards and prices.... obviously trying to impress locals perhaps to keep it an all round year business, but supplying ‘entertainment’ for holiday chalets too..... not a good combination!
Service was very slow.... we had drinks out on the picnic tables in the afternooon - when we came back at night time to eat, our glasses were still sitting there! Bad customer service, as the place wasn’t ever busy.....!

"Spotlessly clean, beautiful building!","We stayed here for a 3 night break last week...
As stated, beautiful imposing building, with great views from the top floor, and all spotlessly clean, with everything anyone could want... milk, tea and coffee supplied, with a fully fitted kitchen and utensils.... local shop within walking distance for basics if you plan cooking there - and a pub with good food too....
Only downside is the entrance way.... the driveway is right after a sharp bend where vision is restricted.... it is meant to be a 30 mph area, but we got caught scarily a couple of times coming out in our small mg from people not respecting the limit, and it being a hidden entry.... so take care!
Apart from that, excellent base for touring around a wide area....

Best French resto outside of France!,"Ate here this weekend, after being impressed reading the menu earlier on in the day!
We ordered mussels and chips, (always being a favourite when we actually lived in France) and it did not disappoint! The chips were amazing! Then crème brûlé (again, a favourite!) and it was really tasty too!
Service couldn't be faulted - staff attentive but not intrusive, and they oozed a general sense of professionalism - resulting in the restaurant being full, mostly of very rich French Lebanese - which says it all!

Mmmm... nothing special!,"We ate here 2 days ago - in fact, we were in the restaurant when the lady 2 comments down this list came in - we overheard the conversation between her and the waiter, and was appalled to hear that he wasn't happy with A- a lady on her own coming in to eat, or B- that she was taking up a table of 4 settings?!? Either way, we were shocked about how she was spoken to, and was relieved to see her finally getting up and leaving!
We were in the middle of our food, otherwise we would've left the empty restaurant too! The food was ok - served by a less than cheery waiter!

Overpriced,"Had an evening meal here this weekend - not a HUGE menu at all, and although what we got was tasty, it was very small portions!

Perfect for short city break!,"We stayed here last weekend, on a 4day/3nights break with EasyJet....
Booked it because of the close proximity to central train station coming from Malpensa airport (in the end we took the bus, but terminal is round the side of the train station!)
Staff were very helpful when we asked directions and advice... we were on bed and breakfast, so can't comment on standard of buffet style meal in evening, but breakfast was good, with a wide range available - even boiled carrots and green beans!
Modern, very clean, yes, a little 'dark' in places, and the 'funky bar' is far from comfortable if sitting for a long time, unless you bag the chairs around the walls, but certainly well worth the money we paid for the whole 'deal' - would recommend it for a short break - convenient for train/bus terminal, and metro just outside door!",November 2016,Glam Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187849-d8638714-Reviews-Glam_Hotel-Milan_Lombardy.html,"Milan, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0

Yes, we had to stand in line for a wee while - security checks on entering, but we didn't mind that at all.....it is free to enter, if you 'are going in to use it as a church' we were told, so there was a long, long queue down the right hand side of it for that, but as tickets were only 2 euros to get in (extra obviously if you want to go up to the terrace, and the archaeological site) but we were very happy to pay that to see the magnificent interior.....",November 2016,Duomo di Milano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187849-d195239-Reviews-Duomo_di_Milano-Milan_Lombardy.html,"Milan, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5

I'm sure we weren't the only ones! On arrival at ticket office, staff were fairly rude, told us to ask elsewhere - we went down the road, only to be told everything is sold out for the week! The truth is, you are only allowed 15 mins in front of the painting, so the rest of the tour is filled in with the church, vineyard, buildings etc..... however THIS is the ONLY away you get to see the painting, so, be advised, either you put up with the tour/bus trip, and gain entry, or be disappointed on arrival....!!!",November 2016,Leonardo's Last Supper Tickets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187849-d8416838-Reviews-Leonardo_s_Last_Supper_Tickets-Milan_Lombardy.html,"Milan, Italy",attractions,1.0,4.0
"Weird experience, but worth doing!","We visited here last Saturday evening on a prebooked ticket - 2 hour experience, with 'aperitifs' served from 7pm..... on arrival, our booking was checked, told very casually to just grab a dressing gown, towel flip flops, and the dressing rooms 'are on the left' - no other guide, tour etc.... the place was FULL, too full to fully enjoy everything - mostly full of young couples making out in every corner!!! 'Private party bookings' ruled out one of the 3 outside jacuzzi, and inside everything was very 'dark' and higeldy pigeldy.... however, if you're into this kind of thing, a wide range of 'treatments' available - and the highlight was indeed the aperitifs at 7pm, when the restaurant doors opened and it seemed like a couple of hundred people swamped the buffet bar!!!

Beautifully presented, small portions, yes, but by the end of the 8 courses, we could take no more - especially after the richest chocolate mousse I have ever tasted!!!

Not the nightmare I was told it would be!,"I was anxious arriving off an easyJet flight as to how easy it would be to get into the centre of Milan - advised by crew on board to take the bus, as if travelling by train the departure is from Terminal 1 only, NOT 2, so the bus would be easier....
Got outside, Malpensa express bus was sitting there, thankfully, as it was pouring of rain! 8 euros each, paid to driver directly, and it took us an hour and a quarter, even in rushour traffic 5-6pm..... we left on the Sunday morning, and was wary that the times wouldn't be quite so frequent, but were told that yes, even then it leaves every 20 mins... bus was there waiting again, at terminal stop, at the side of the train station, and this time it took only 45 mins....

"Worst burger ever, along with SHOCKING attitude of owner!","We popped in here today as a last minute decision - bad move! Our first instincts as we pulled up were not good - only 2 other cars parked at the door on a Sunday lunchtime? Not good, but my sister, being a local stated, well, it doesn't have a good reputation, but let's give it a try anyway...... Mmmmm..... Should've never entered!
Myself and my sister ordered the cheeseburger each - her young son, a kiddies meal of the same thing - and my mother a 'croque monsieur'.....
Upon arrival, I instantly didn't like the look of the burger - it was grey in colour, with a thin layer of already melted pale cheese dripping off, which was swimming in the grease lying on top! I took one bite and decide it clearly was NOT the Aberdeen Angus steak meat is said on the menu, and could eat no more! My sister tried, and couldn't even swallow one mouthful - it was full of grease and gristle.....! Of course, her son had the same burger, so she insisted he wasn't to eat it either - if she wasn't prepared to put her burger in her mouth, then no way was she inflicting it on her 6year old either! The croque Monsieur arrived - come on people!?! In NO WAY was this a croque Monsieur!!! After living in France for 15 years, THIS was a far cry from the luscious, gooey delicious cheesy treat it should have been - it was a dried up, nearly burnt ham and cheese toastie! Granted, it did say in brackets on the menu, insultingly to those of us who DID know what a croque Monsieur was, ""ham and cheese toastie"" and thus, should've been all the explanation it needed! Soooo not worth the price!
We all have had bad meals in the past, but this was the first one I actually decided I wasn't going to pay for, as it was SOOOO bad...... But my mother was sooo hungry after travelling all the way from Inverness, and she decided to eat her 'toastie' anyway.....
It wasn't until that had gone did the waitress think to check in on us to ask if everything was OK..... Only to be met by 3 full meals still sitting in front of us, and the request for the bill please.....?!?? We were willing to pay for what we had eaten - 4 drinks, the toastie, and a small bowl of chips (ordered because the awful burger didn't even COME with fries, at £8.50 if my memory serves me well!?!) shocking!
Eventually, while paying the bill with the deductions, the owner dared show her face and asked us about the burgers which were sent back.... No apology, no suggestion of offering us anything else, just stated we were the first to complain about the burger, and that they use a reputable butcher....! When we said well, sadly, we heard the restaurant didn't have a good reputation locally anyway, but we were willing to give it a try, to see for ourselves, she literally smiled and smirked 'oh, the LOCALS....? Of COURSE they're going to give us a bad reputation...!!"" Clearly we were not the first to complain!!!
ERH? What????? So that's ok then???? Surely if you're running a business, of any kind, it's your LOCALS who are your bread and butter off season, and its they you SHOULD be trying to provide a service for, no?????
I rarely complain in restaurants, but we came away feeling shocked that the owner actually said that! I hope the only other couple in the restaurant weren't indeed locals and who would've heard our discussion!

The technology involved in the reinactment of the battle was very interesting, and even for a wife who listens to husband going on and on about history, and not being very interested most of the time, I was captivated here, as were our guests! Bit pricey to get in, but worth it, as with time spent visiting the battlefield, the lovely coffee shop and tasteful gift shop, you could easily spend an afternoon here, totally absorbing the atmosphere and history........ Well done!",August 2016,Culloden Battlefield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g4600483-d191384-Reviews-Culloden_Battlefield-Culloden_Moor_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Culloden Moor, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Sadly, very disappointing...","Had lunch there today - choosing to go, as, in the past, we have had a really good meal there.... Well, not today, sadly..... The waiter was 'blunt' and unsociable both when he showed us to our table, then when he FINALLY came back to take our order - the waitress just simply ignored us when clearly we had made our choice... We ordered the Glenmorangie chicken - obviously very little whisky was used in the sauce, just tasted like a normal cream sauce... The potatoes were stone cold, and the veg and rice were barely warm..... The above mentioned staff both asked us at the end how our meal was, which we commented 'well, could have been hotter??', being polite, to which they both chose to ignore us, then finally while paying the bill, I actually said to the barman when he asked the same question, 'Well, it could've been a lot better!' - he too, ignored my comment - and he, being a local, unlike the other two who might use this as an excuse, clearly would've understood me!!!!!
Sadly, due to service more than the bad food, we won't be back! There are plenty more lovely restaurants in Inverness where the staff are at least cheery and welcoming!!!",July 2016,Ash,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186543-d1408883-Reviews-Ash-Inverness_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Inverness, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,3.0
