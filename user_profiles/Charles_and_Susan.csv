An enjoyable visit - relaxing,"There are some of the paths and areas closed at the moment - there's still plenty to wander around.

Following a one-way path along the stream to the Load Mill then takes you through the Winter Gardens which had clearly been well looked after. We took a walk through the woods and to the wildlife area too.

On the way back are some hidden gardens. Although the Rose garden will be a while before it's in flower we did find the ""in""formal garden filled with beds of tulips - a riot of colour.

There are two takeaways for the usual NT drinks and snacks. I expect that the House may be open after the 17th May",May 2021,Anglesey Abbey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g11839748-d215325-Reviews-Anglesey_Abbey-Lode_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Lode, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Traditional Pier with views,"We always enjoy a walk along a pier and this was no exception. It was a cold day but it was refreshing to get into the sea air for a blow. The cafe at the shore end was open for takeaways but otherwise everything was closed.

Most of the shops, etc had ""opening soon"" notices so I expect it'll be in full flow shortly.. You get great views of the shoreline and bay from the pier.

Check out the water driven clock near the end and look out for the funny mirrors on the way back.",May 2021,Southwold Pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g503753-d2049861-Reviews-Southwold_Pier-Southwold_Suffolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Southwold, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
A relaxing and interesting visit,"We'd booked the first slot as we usually do and the zoo was quiet with lots of space to wander around. As the day went on there were more people around but no problem with safety spacing at all. It's a large place and there's plenty to see and do. There are a few one-way paths but in the main you can wander safely at will.

All the animals looked comfortable, even the Lions were chilling on the grass although they must have thought it a bit cold! There were two takeaway kiosks when we were there serving drinks and snacks.

We spotted a new born lamb in a field and the keeper was just arriving to take the lamb and its mum into a sheltered area.",May 2021,Africa Alive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190775-d214841-Reviews-Africa_Alive-Lowestoft_Suffolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Lowestoft, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Friendly amazing place,"We had a couple of rides on each of the trains and a couple on the carousel too. Everyone there was very friendly. The takeaway kiosk is worth a visit for drinks and snacks. The main restaurant isn't open at the moment.

We spent ages looking around the garden areas. Just when you think you've seem it all you turn the corner and there's another section of the garden.",May 2021,Bressingham Steam Museum and Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2233522-d654917-Reviews-Bressingham_Steam_Museum_and_Gardens-Bressingham_Diss_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Bressingham, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0

It was just OK,"We were visiting Great Yarmouth and thought we'd have a takeaway treat. Unfortunately this wasn't it. The sauces for the two meals tasted as though they were watered down - very little flavour. Both were ""specials"", in one the mixed meat was OK but the other had very little.

Next time in Great Yarmouth well be trying a different Chinese takeaway.",May 2021,Mandarin House Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190788-d8319596-Reviews-Mandarin_House_Restaurant-Great_Yarmouth_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Great Yarmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Lots of walks around the estate,"We'd stopped off on our way for a few days at the coast and after the car ride it was just what we needed. The estate seemed vast. After the obligatory coffee and cake we went on the Blue walk, listed as 5km. It took you right out into the parkland. We didn't see anyone else for ages, very relaxing and refreshing.

We'd brought a packup for lunch as you don't know what you'll find nowadays. After that we explored The West Wing shop. Then on to the Italianate Gardens.

The formal gardens were OK but there was an extensive Loggery around the outside which was amazing. We'd never seen such a large Loggery and some work was obviously going on to revive it. See if you can find the dragon.

We did walk out to the walled garden, some work has been done recently to plant fruit trees along some of the paths but mainly it's a grassed area at the moment. Maybe there are plans for it but we didn't see any indication of this.",May 2021,Ickworth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315932-d218341-Reviews-Ickworth-Horringer_Bury_St_Edmunds_Suffolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Horringer, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Usual KFC - OK,"We were looking for something to eat on a rainy evening and KFC came to the rescue. It's right on the seafront, we ordered and paid on the App and collected it from inside - no problem.

KFC chicken was good - I still don't like the new fries as much as the old ones. They're never crisp now, they always seem soggy to me.

An easy-ish Bike Ride,"We hired our bikes for 4hr from Hassop Station. It's then easy to get onto the trail route and bike though the tunnels. Coming out at the first tunnel at Monsal Head gives you great views from the top of the viaduct.

Passing Miller's Dale station on the way to the end gives you a spot to aim for on the way back. There are refreshments and toilets there.

Coming back most of the track is slightly downhill.",April 2021,Monsal Trail,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g209968-d3239567-Reviews-Monsal_Trail-Bakewell_Peak_District_National_Park_England.html,"Bakewell, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
An enjoyable visit,"It was fairly busy and most of the free parking spaces are now taken with external seating - so it was the pay car park this time.

We enjoyed a coffee and cake as usual before we went to hire the bikes for the Monsal Trail. The ordering App was telling us it would be just over half an hour to get our food so we went to the takeaway hatch and ordered directly - that came within a few minutes.

I had the Cheesecake of the Day which was quite and experience. It turned out to be Chocolate Orange flavour. I'm a big fan of cheesecakes but the tang of the cheesecake mixed with the ultra sweet chocolate orange - mmmm, not sure.

We hired the bikes for 4hrs and set off down the trail. Plenty of time to go to the end and then stop off to have lunch on the way back at Miller's Dale station facilities.",April 2021,Hassop Station Cafe & Monsal Trail Cycle Hire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g209968-d1797903-Reviews-Hassop_Station_Cafe_Monsal_Trail_Cycle_Hire-Bakewell_Peak_District_National_Park_.html,"Bakewell, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Enchanting walk along the river.,"We enjoy walking through these gardens, picking out the Victorian remnants that still charm. It's good to walk through here and then back over the bridge and alongside the river back to town.

Carry on past the bridge first to see the streams passing through the gardens. This time we ventured up onto some paths on the hillside against the road. Make it an adventure!

There are rowing boats from here too if you're feeing energetic.",April 2021,Derwent Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635672-d7790520-Reviews-Derwent_Gardens-Matlock_Bath_Matlock_Derbyshire_England.html,"Matlock Bath, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Lovely relaxing green space in the town,"We parked in the little car park belonging to the Park - it's free on Sundays. First stop was the cafe, the Pavilion Tea Rooms, - it's a bit upmarket for your typical park cafe. Our sandwiches were accompanied by salad and crisps. It was good though - plenty of seating.

We wandered around the park, there's plenty of paths with flowers and ponds, etc to see as you walk around.

Always worth a visit,"The garden is planted up at the moment with what will become the summer display. There is some colour at the moment but it's not at its best yet.

It's a relaxing place with plenty of seats to take in the views. Quite a bit of the original architecture survives.

VIsit during the summer for best colour,"This is in the South Cliff Gardens, a little nearer to the Spa than the Italian Gardens. It's well looked after and had 1100 new roses planted in a makeover in 2014.

Obviously at its best in late summer when all the roses are in flower.

There's a notice explaining how it came to be and the history of it.

The guy who originally planted it had a large house on the esplanade with a tunnel under the road to get to his gardens on the South Cliff.",April 2021,Rose Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190744-d20315770-Reviews-Rose_Garden-Scarborough_Scarborough_District_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Well worth walking to,"We usually park on the road above the cafe and start or Scarborough visit here. This time we'd parked and started at the Castle so it was a good walk, taking in the pier, the beach and the Italian Gardens to arrive at our go-to cafe in Scarborough.

We weren't disappointed. An amazing cream tea with so much luscious thick cream and a tasty fruit scone that is was eaten without the jab. Just amazing.

They do all sorts of food too - give it a go.

Great to be at the water's edge.,"We were pleased to see the tide had gone out during our day here and a walk along the beach completes that seaside experience.

Walk through the park alongside the Castle,"We took the path to the left as you come out of the Castle and this takes you through Royal Albert Park on various routes down to the seafront.

We followed the paths to the righthand side and these eventually brought us out opposite the harbour pier entrance.

This is a good alternative to walking down the streets and there are other parts of the park to explore if you wanted to.",April 2021,Royal Albert Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190744-d21164402-Reviews-Royal_Albert_Park-Scarborough_Scarborough_District_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Pleasant surroundings with a celebrity grave.,"There are ruins in the churchyard showing that the church was much bigger at one time. When it's been open in the past we've called in for a look around - sometimes lucky to have a tea and cake too.

In the churchyard is Anne Bronte's grave. It's rather dilapidated and there has been a new stone placed so that you can understand the writing on the original.

It has a car park in an old part of the cemetery - a good place when visiting the castle.",April 2021,St Mary's Church,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190744-d6825385-Reviews-St_Mary_s_Church-Scarborough_Scarborough_District_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5
Relaxing space and views around Scarborough from here.,"It's good to get back and wander around this castle and take in the views. The Keep and Walls are still open to climb up and they give you great views all over both bays of Scarborough and the Harbour too.

There are unexpected things to check out like Roman Remains and a Chapel.

There's a basic takeaway service from a window to get your drinks and a snack.",April 2021,Scarborough Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190744-d2268365-Reviews-Scarborough_Castle-Scarborough_Scarborough_District_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5

A mixed countryside area with great views - a bit challenging.,"It was a lovely walk in the Spring sunshine over the hill from Matlock to Matlock Bath.

It's a bit of an uphill path through the grassy area alongside the cliff edge but well worth it. There are view points along the way which are fenced so that you're safe whilst looking out and down on the valley below.

Most of the cliff edge is unfenced but it's safe to walk along the paths that cross through the area. Making your way gradually to the top you get lots of great views over the countryside both sides. You can see Abraham Heights cable cars too as you wander towards them.

A lot of the area is now fenced off. When we cam any years ago we remember the boys exploring the chasms, early mining channels some dating back to the Romans, but these now are fenced off for safety (!).

As you approach the Matlock Bath end of High Tor you descend on a path through the woods. At this time of year there are bluebells beginning to flower.

All in all, a great walk with nature which does you good, especially in our current circumstances.",April 2021,High Tor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g209970-d7142610-Reviews-High_Tor-Matlock_Derbyshire_England.html,"Matlock, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
A world away from the noise of the seafront,"This is a wide, tree-lined, walk that leaves Burgh Road between Highfields and Haven Caravan Site and the Fire Station - about half a mile up Burgh Road (A158) from the traffic lights on Roman Bank.

There's a plaque on a pillar as you enter the walk telling you a little of its history.

It wends it's way through the peaceful countryside to emerge on the edge of a housing estate on Roman Bank at Winthorpe. If you want to vary the walk back into Skegness then carry on up to Winthorpe Avenue, make your way to the seafront and walk back to Skegness along the sea wall.

A great walk well away from the bright lights of Skegness main seafront.",April 2021,King George V Walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190733-d23326715-Reviews-King_George_V_Walk-Skegness_Lincolnshire_England.html,"Skegness, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0

A pleasant walk around the gardens,"We enjoyed the time walking around the gardens, finding different paths and structures. The House isn't open at the moment - the gardens have been well cared for. The flower beds in front of the House are full of colour, they look just great.

With the time of year there were lots of daffodils and other spring flowers to see and you could also see the potential for flowers later in the season and through summer.

Some work going on restricted access to a few areas but nothing to spoil the wandering around.

There's a takeaway snack and drinks service open and we had coffee and cake in the morning and then a soup and a sausage bap for lunch. It was OK - it was quite pricey though.

Even though it was Easter holidays and there were lots of families doing the Easter trail it didn't seem crowded and we were fine walking around everywhere - even on the smaller paths.",April 2021,Brodsworth Hall and Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187067-d213501-Reviews-Brodsworth_Hall_and_Gardens-Doncaster_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great time out in the fresh air and nature.,"We really enjoyed our visit, it was our first trip out after the relaxation of lockdown and it was great to feel something was near normal at last.

We arrived in the 09:30 first timed slot and set off for a walk around the wilderness woods walk looking forward to a coffee and cake on our return. It was good to wander through the trees and a slight error on the way back (carried on right instead of left when coming out of the woods towards the lake) took us nearly into Kedleston village where we crossed over the river on stepping stones. Somewhere we'd not been before so it worked out well.

Coffee and cake was enjoyed - we were lucky to find a seat in the churchyard as the tables and chairs haven't reappeared yet.

After a rest we set off on the Long Walk and that was good too. A little busy on the first half as there were families following the Easter Trial but no problem. We went carefully through the field with sheep on the way back seeing lots of delightful lambs. Some of which seemed to be posing for our photos!

Lots of open space,"We did our curcular walk from Long Eaton along the Trent and back alongside the railway. Its great to get out in the open air with a different view to the streets we normally walk around home.

Most of the way the paths are quite wide and people are few. The main path from the car park is always a place to be careful as not all people will move to the side as you walk towards them. Some insisting on walking 3 or 4 abreast making you step off the path to avoid them. Apparently they're immune - or just ignorant!

Anyway, if you take care of yourself - it's a tonic to walk around here.",February 2021,Attenborough Nature Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1024120-d1019882-Reviews-Attenborough_Nature_Centre-Attenborough_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Attenborough, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Pleased it's still open for takeaways,"We'd planned a walk down the Erewash Canal and the left at Trent Lock along the Trent. The river had a different idea. The path along the river from Trent Lock was completely under water. So, we headed right instead towards Sawley Lock and Marina.

The Waterside Cafe was open for takeaways and we have lattes and a delicious Apple and Toffee cake each. It was really good. Whether we'd walked enough to use all those calories we'll see in the morning!",January 2021,Waterside Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1636336-d21003466-Reviews-Waterside_Cafe-Sawley_Derbyshire_England.html,"Sawley, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Hidden away peaceful green space,"We were having one of our exercise walks exploring new areas of our locality and we found his park. It has a play area for young children but is mostly open green space hidden between the houses and the railway embankment.

A great place to get some fresh air and relaxation nowadays.",January 2021,Norfolk Road Play Area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g658238-d23119816-Reviews-Norfolk_Road_Play_Area-Long_Eaton_Derbyshire_England.html,"Long Eaton, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
A relaxing walk around the wood,"We'd seen this mentioned in a local newspaper article - it had been made a local nature reserve in April 2020. It has a small car park with access into the wood.

The paths were a bit muddy on the day we went but it was still good to walk around, breathe the fresh air and relax for a while. There were a few other people there, I expect that there would be more at weekends.

We enjoyed a walk around the perimeter path - there are paths leading off to various open grassed areas. I expect it would be good to explore in the spring/summer especially.",January 2021,Orchid Wood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g20150553-d23038986-Reviews-Orchid_Wood-Breaston_Derbyshire_England.html,"Breaston, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Good place for a walk,"It has it's own small car park off the road from Sawley to Draycott.

It has a circular footpath going around the perimeter with paths off to various green spaces along the way. When we were there the paths were very muddy but passable.

Good to see - needs some tic.,"It's always good to see the Clock Tower - you know you've arrived in Skegness. It was a cold winter's day when we were there this time, still good to have a walk along the promenade and beach.

It's a shame to see it in such a state - there are huge parts of it covered in green patches. It needs a bit of tlc.",December 2020,Skegness Clock Tower,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190733-d13162272-Reviews-Skegness_Clock_Tower-Skegness_Lincolnshire_England.html,"Skegness, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Plenty of open space for a relaxing walk,"Once you've parked up there's paths and gardens to explore. It's best to download and print the maps for the gardens and also for the several signed walks to get the best of your visit. These are on the Newstead Abbey web site.

First stop, of course, the cafe for a takeaway coffee and cake - Christmas Cake included this time. Then off on the ""Long ""Walk"" shown as 1.6 miles in the leaflet. We'd not done this before and so it was an exploration of the countryside around the Abbey. It was very muddy in places but we had our boots on so OK.

Back to the Abbey and cafe for lunch - how can you resist a Turkey and Cranberry Panini? Christmas coming again!

After lunch we wandered around the various formal gardens. The map was useful here to check we'd covered most areas. We paused for an interesting chat with the gardener in the Japanese garden and then wandered through various previously unexplored pathways back to the car.

We stayed just over four hours today - we tend to stay longer in places nowadays as you can't go to many places and it's good to get the most from those you can.

All in all a good day out in a safe and friendly environment.",December 2020,Newstead Abbey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1182505-d297775-Reviews-Newstead_Abbey-Ravenshead_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Ravenshead, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Quiet walk in a natural environment - and Mud!,"We'd been earlier in the year and were keen to go back to see how it looked in Autumn/Winter. It's still a good place to find peace and quiet away from the other visitors to Elvaston Castle. We only met one other person on our way around the Nature Reserve.

There are good views over the water areas now that you can see through the trees. We had our walking boots on - a good job, the mud in places on the path was deep and sticky. An enjoyable walk even so - just don't go in your best shoes!",December 2020,Elvaston Local Nature Reserve,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2138826-d21030579-Reviews-Elvaston_Local_Nature_Reserve-Elvaston_Derbyshire_England.html,"Elvaston, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Good coffee stop,"It's a good place to aim for when walking along the River Trent and canals in the area. We'd come from Long Eaton and enjoyed a coffee this time. We have had cakes too previously which were good.

They're doing a takeaway menu at the moment and are open 7 days a week.",December 2020,Waterside Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1636336-d21003466-Reviews-Waterside_Cafe-Sawley_Derbyshire_England.html,"Sawley, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Open and spacious grounds to wander in,"We'd booked the first timed slot and there seemed to be quite a few cars in the car park but this didn't turn out to be a problem. As soon as we were walking the paths around the estate there we met very few people. It was raining a bit all day which may have put people off from wandering far but we were dressed for the weather and it was no problem.

We walked the Log Walk first and then after lunch did the Wilderness Walk. All in all we were there for around 4 hours and enjoyed it.

There is a snack kiosk open and it was our first stop - we had coffee and a mince pie. We were back at lunchtime for a delicious Turkey Bap. Christmas had arrived at the snack kiosk.",December 2020,Kedleston Hall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2290356-d2263085-Reviews-Kedleston_Hall-Kedleston_Derbyshire_England.html,"Kedleston, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5

Lots of open space and fresh air,"We did a circuit of the park and enjoyed the open space and fresh air. There are still some plants and shrubs having a go at flowering which is good. The Planets are mainly reduced to autumn/winter shapes of foliage but still worth a look.

Not many people around on a slightly overcast day today - there's plenty of empty space though even when busier.",November 2020,West Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g658238-d11702430-Reviews-West_Park-Long_Eaton_Derbyshire_England.html,"Long Eaton, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Open safe areas to walk around - lots of interest, even at this time of year.","Our booked slot had us arriving in good time for a coffee and cake before we wandered around. All the arrangements for safe takeaways are in place.

We started with the signed walk around the gardens. Although they're not in full flow at this time of year there was plenty to see. We also noticed that there seemed to be new rooms open in the garden area to peek in as you wandered around.

We visited the Ice House and the Grotto whilst we were on the way back from the gardens. Neither if which we'd seen on previous visits. This left us just time to walk the Pink Walk around the ponds prior to lunch.

We had a sausage roll for lunch - the menu was missing sandwiches.

After lunch we did the Red Walk and enjoyed the open air and views again. A good day out and very relaxing atmosphere all round.

There were some new structures around the grounds - whatever you think of them (they're big and red) putting one next to the house and spoiling the view out over the parkland seems a strange decision.",November 2020,Calke Abbey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g642233-d284673-Reviews-Calke_Abbey-Ticknall_Derbyshire_England.html,"Ticknall, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Plenty of walking space,"It's often difficult to squeeze into the small free car park but there is a university pay car park just alongside.

It's a good place for fresh air and exercise. A walk round the lake is a tonic in these restricted times. Most of the park is quite open and spacious, there's just a small stretch of the path on the University side of the lake that is narrow.

We did notice that the cafe is doing takeaway and, for the first time, the toilets were open.

There's a new planting and seating area under construction near to the paddling pool area.",November 2020,Highfields,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186356-d2509975-Reviews-Highfields-Nottingham_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Always a pleasure to wander through,"The gardens above the Spa are a pleasure to wander through. The Italian Gardens are part of that and they still retain some of their earlier wow factor. They must have looked really good in their heyday.

Chech out the three photos. There's a large house across the road which has direct access to the gardens from its front garden through a tunnel under the road.
