Over Priced,"First time at The Flying Pig, The place as a welcoming atmosphere, we booked a table for a meal.
First thing which i add not realised it allowed dogs and in the eating area as well, the time we were there, i noticed that on three tables in the eating area were six dogs.
The food was normal pub grub, it was tasty, but the amounts you get were not justified by the prices. I myself had ribeye which was only 6 inch in diameter, one tomato cut in half three onion rings and a small basket of frys, small jar of jus , witch was priced £23.95.
I would expect with the amount being served, around the £15 mark .
When we asked for the bill, we showed them our local discount card, so then having the discount deducted, we had a £50. Gift voucher.
When coming to pay, they first did not take the discount voucher off so had to redo the bill again. This time they did not give us the local discount so it finshed up paying full price.
They put pressure on trying to resolve this and we finshed up having to leave.
My over view would be if your looking for a bar meal, and happy paying over the odds and ok with dogs sat round you as eat then The flying Pig ok.",May 2019,The Flying Pig,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190820-d9589904-Reviews-The_Flying_Pig-Bowness_on_Windermere_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Bowness-on-Windermere, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
