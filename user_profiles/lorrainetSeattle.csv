Wow! Especially with a tanker going through,This is a really interesting site and well worth the side trip. Our teen really enjoyed thinking of the engineering to tackle this. There is bungie jumping available which may work for some but not our thing. We loved watching a tanker pulled by a tug going through with the crew below yelling Happy New Year and all of us on bridge doing the same. Plus the scenic highway to Nafplio starts right here so very easy for driving.,December 2019,Corinth Canal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1188932-d2454053-Reviews-Corinth_Canal-Isthmia_Loutraki_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Isthmia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fascinating and beautiful,"Amazing to walk through Lion's Gate and to think about the intersection of pre-civilization and civilization. Good museum. As usual ( as we found in Greece) when touring the site itself the interp signs do not tell the story or the connected myths. More focused on mechanics and architecture. But museum did a good job with this. With teens, definately worth reading the myths enroute before doing a site visit.",January 2020,Lion Gate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189486-d232311-Reviews-Lion_Gate-Mycenae_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Mycenae, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

"Meteora Great, Drive to Kalambaka not so much","Everyone said we had to see Meteora in Central Greece so we made the four hour trek from Delphi. After crossing beautiful Mt Parnassus area, we were funneled down into confusing toll superhighways. ( Make sure you have studied which way to go because if you go the wrong way, it may be 20 plus miles before you can exit!l). The area of Central Greece we traveled across was full of smoke and lots of highway construction. The sprawl around Trikala worried us. The hotel we had booked was on a highway with many neon lights. Where is this world class UNESCO site, we wondered? But, the journey was indeed worth it. The next day we visited three of the monasteries in the pouring rain and all were beautiful. Varlaam has a great museum. Worth the effort to get here! If possible, I recommend booking a home or hotel well up towards the rocks in Kalambaka as this part of the village is very nice",January 2020,Meteora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1070999-d523805-Reviews-Meteora-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

Architectual and Historical Wonder,"The antiquities housed here are fantastic, and the building itself is worth visiting.

Best Hamburger in the Valley,We love this place. The food is excellent for a tavern setting-absolutely love their burgers. And the setting is so peaceful.

"Excellent food, excellent atmosphere",I had the vegetarian platter for one. It was excellent - spiced well with fresh vegetables and lots of various Ethiopian dishes. Some of the best Ethiopian food I have had in the US or in Ethiopia. My only suggestion would be that the restaurant either regularly circulates with more injera for those of us who use it all ... or put a fork at each place setting. Otherwise one can end up looking at lots of food on your with no way to eat it properly.

Perfect for airport and day of rest,"Like many others, we chose this hotel as we had an early morning flight out of Rome. The hotel was perfect for exploring Fiumicino. Their breakfast (included) is excellent, rooms are clean and spacious, huge beds, shuttle is on-time. Best of all the waterfront in front of the hotel is full of great places to eat seafood. We enjoyed watching the fishing boats and quiet pace of Fiumicino. On the advice of a local we purchased an all-day metrebus pass (8 euro) and took trains, buses, subways to Rome and back quite easily. There are buses that go to the train station (one stop before the airport terminal), It takes an hour or less to get to central Rome on public transport this way.

Best Value in Addis,"We have taken 5 trips to Ethiopia so have tried many hotels in Addis, The Jupiter Cazanchis is by far the best value.

Not customer friendly for eating!,"This used to be a nice normal, somewhat funky, store. It has had a complete re-model and looks very trendy now with higher end grocery products for sale. There is a restaurant and counter. However it is impossible to figure out what they sell to eat. There are very few things in their counter display. We asked ""Do you have a menu?"" - ""No"" (no explanation ). There is a chalk board with coffee but nothing else. Our son came back to us and said ""They said I could have a grilled cheese sandwich."". So o.k. - that is a possibility. (It was not edible by the way- even the person who made it said she had overcooked it and yet she still handed it to a 10 year old and asked him to pay for it!). We saw someone eating soup or chili at the counter but by this time had given up. Not a good experience and we would not recommend it for eating. Which is too bad as it has a nice location but they really don't seem to care about the dining/lunch end of their operation.",June 2014,Mazama Store,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58598-d3192762-Reviews-Mazama_Store-Mazama_Washington.html,"Mazama, Washington",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Stick with the Great Simien Trip,"Tesfahun arranged an excellent 4-day Simien Mountain Trip for my family of four (2 adults and 2 children). The guide he selected for us, Getinet, was exceptional. Not only is his English flawless, his deep knowledge of the mountains and his experiences and community attitude were outstanding. We could not imagine a better guide and you would be very fortunate to have his services. Our cook, scout and child carrier (we arranged to have our youngest child carried) were also wonderful. The Simien Mountain themselves are exquisite. We loved the trip. The price was very reasonable and Tesfahun was attentive to our needs. WE advise that you bring your own sleeping bags and thermarests and some good warm clothes. Be advised that in Gondor many banks did not want our new $100 US bills (we eventually found one bank that did)

Because the Simien Mtn Trip worked out so well, we considered using the Simien Land Tours operator in Axum. Unfortunately this did not work out well and in the end we went with another company in Axum.",December 2013,Simen Land Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g317059-d3681649-Reviews-Simen_Land_Tours-Gonder_Amhara_Region.html,"Gonder, Ethiopia",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Great food, fine rooms",The AG Palace is central..but right now that means being in the middle of the subway mess. This makes it a little hard to access as the most direct route is blocked off. Once the subway is done however it will be very central. The rooms are small but fine and relatively quiet. The bathrooms are clean and water is hot and plentiful. The wi-fi is free and fast.

"A bit over-priced but nice if you want quiet, spacious accomodation","Abbaba's Villa is an older home with wonderful atmosphere and traditional Ethiopian furniture etc. Lovely interior. The beds are extremely comfortable. The bathrooms are large and clean. The dinners are healthy although a bit bland. The breakfasts were fine but not hearty. They often ran out of things like milk for coffee or cereal. It is very quiet part of town so one can get a good night's sleep and the house and gardens are large so lots of room to stretch out. Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. The price is similar to a downtown hotel which we found steep for where the Villa is located since you must take a taxi to get back and forth from town. There are no restaurants nearby (to speak of) so you either need to eat before you ""taxi home"" or eat their meals. It is located near the German, French and US Embassies. Be sure that you understand the rates. We had a confusion which caused us to pay more than we expected. Free airport transfer is only ""from"" the airport (not to). Overall, a very nice place however we felt it was over-priced for its location",November 2013,Abbaba's Villa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293791-d1418978-Reviews-Abbaba_s_Villa-Addis_Ababa.html,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Fine hotel,We had been to the Goha eight years ago and returned in November to find it good value. Although the rooms are on the small side they are comfortable and fine.

Excellent but charged full meal rate for a toddler,The four sisters has excellent traditional food however when we got the bill we saw they had charged the full buffet rate for our 4 year old who ate 5 pieces of macaroni.

Great Birding!,This hotel is just fine. The room are smallish but clean. The food is satisfactory. It is cheap and easy to take a tuk-tuk to town. What really sets the hotel apart is its great yard and bird life. We saw more birds here than on any other hotel grounds in Ethiopia. The guard knows the birds well and showed us many of their nesting areas. The exceptional birding opportunities - coffee cup in hand - makes for a very enjoyable stay plus the boats for tours of the churches can pick you up at the hotel.

"Peaceful, lovely but the ""jet setting"" interferes","This is terrific value for the B & B rate in a stunning location. Take time to explore the grounds as they are lovely with many viewpoints of the valley and rock cliffs. Staff were a bit stand offish but also not hovering. Our room on the uphill side (room 9) initially seemed idyllic...until the helicopter arrived. It parked directly in front of our window and came and went repeatedly 3 out of the 4 days we were there which marred the ""natural"" ""sustainable"" motto of the lodge. One morning pre-dawn the pilot and aides loudly banged barrels and re-fueled so they could take off at dawn with their clients. Since we paid the same room rate as the jet-setters, I would hope in the future they get the rooms near their helicopter. (There seemed to be many disgruntled comments from other guests about the helicopter both at the lodge and dropping in at the otherwise peaceful rock churches - so the owner should carefully consider how to make this transport style fit the general tone of the place).

The dinners were good (but they eat late!) as were the breakfasts. The picnic lunches are way over-priced for what is included. We stopped in town on our way to the churches and bought essentially the same bread and bananas for a fraction of the price. We also ate frequently in town at an excellent restaurant- the Crealta. Other guests did not seem to go to town at all, however we enjoyed the easy walk and seeing the town and its people.

There is surprising scant information at the lodge about the nearby rock churches. There is not even a map that we could find and only one battered picture book that is not comprehensive. The staff were not helpful in this regard saying that what we visited was up to us - but since we didn't know anything it was hard to make decisions. So one has to have done their homework to know what churches to go and see, how accessible they are, the physical exertion needed and time to get there etc etc. One day we had a young and not very good local guide who said it was 'too hot"" to see a second church (not!) and then proceeded to ask us for our shoes, our sunglasses, our headlamp etc. The next day we had an excellent guide.

We are surprised the lodge does not accept visa since there is no way to access an ATM nearby. This limits you to the birr you bring with you.

Overall a lovely place that we would return to",December 2013,Gheralta Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2214567-d676720-Reviews-Gheralta_Lodge-Hawzen_Tigray_Region.html,"Hawzen, Ethiopia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Stay at least an extra day to see this place,Most people fly in and out of Sandspit for their trip to Haida Gwaii. It is highly recommended that you spend several hours at the Heritage Centre outside of Skidegate (a short ferry ride across the inlet from Sandspit). If you do it before your trip you'll probably spend half a day there. If you do it afterwards you may spend longer. It puts so much of this lovely place and its culture and history into perspective.Some people recommend a visit on either end of the trip.

Fascinating & Beautiful,We stayed two nights at Sun Lakes/ Dry Falls State Park. Very much a kid friendly scene with lots to do and lots of action - like being in a neighborhood. Not a place for those looking for peace and quiet (they should instead go to Steamboat Rock State Park a bit further north). The Interpretive Center is very close to the Sun Lakes/Dry Falls campground and is very well done. The geology lesson is fascinating even for kids and the views are outstanding. You can stand there and imagine the water creating this place eons ago. Well worth a visit and even going out of your way to see it. Not to mention that the landscape from Dry Falls to Coulee Dam would be a National Park in most countries. There is a pretty good set of stairs to get up to the center but there is an elevator . May want to call to make sure it is working if an elevator is essential to your group.,June 2013,Dry Falls Interpretive Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g58421-d145900-Reviews-Dry_Falls_Interpretive_Center-Coulee_City_Washington.html,"Coulee City, Washington",attractions,5.0,4.5
Man Trying To Dominate Nature?,"The dam is quite an impressive piece of work- even art. Certainly the evening laser light show over the cascading waters is art. It doesn't start until dark so can be a late evening with bugs - be prepared. The sound track for the laser show reminded me of the news tracks before movies during the war - a bit over the top on taming nature, making the desert flower etc. The exhibits themselves however do have a more balanced approach as they have an area where Native Americans tell their side of the story and what was lost. Environmentalists may have a hard time with the whole thing since exploring the down side of dams is minimal. Historians will find it interesting and most people will just enjoy it for a great example of human effort and what allows Eastern Washington to exist as the agricultural area it is today. It's quite remarkable how close they let you get to everything.",June 2013,Grand Coulee Dam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60882-d124594-Reviews-Grand_Coulee_Dam-Coulee_Dam_Washington.html,"Coulee Dam, Washington",attractions,4.0,4.0
