Service is not consistent,"I stayed here in October & gave Costa D Este a nice review. Unfortunately my stay in November 2020 was disappointing. I had reserved the Oceanfront King Cabana with Amy as their reservation system was down. I specified I only wanted this cabana if I was not placed in room 114 as this was my room during the October stay. Room 114 is adjacent to the bar, the band sets up next to the private patio, which results in loud music. There are guests seated for breakfast next to your patio so that you cannot sit outside & read or hold a private (phone) conversation day or night. I was assured I would not be placed in room 114 & that this would be written in my reservation.

Upon checkin, I was told the reservation remarks showed that I should be in the south tower (not room 114) but the front desk clerk could not say why the room was not set aside &that there was no room available other than room 114. Since I was staying 3 nights, I asked to be moved if there was a cancellation. The next day I asked the front desk & although there was a series of miscommunications, I was finally told I could move to another room.

In my haste, I left my gold earrings next to the telephone on the nightstand in room 114. I advised the front desk, was told the room had been cleaned & the earrings were not found/returned by the cleaning staff. I asked that the room be checked only to be told another guest had checked in & they could not reach them but would try again later. I inquired upon checkout, the front desk knew nothing about the lost earrings & said the guest had checked out. The front desk clerk had never listed the missing earrings on their log so Jennie recorded the missing earrings. Other than Jennie, I felt that the staff was annoyed at my request to change rooms and to help find my earrings.

Our breakfasts & dinner were delicious, the pool clean, the bartender very nice. However, I would be reluctant to stay here again or recommend Costa D Este due to my experience with the front desk and reservations. It really made for a disappointing trip for myself and my husband.",November 2020,Costa d'Este Beach Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34709-d3783822-Reviews-Costa_d_Este_Beach_Resort_Spa-Vero_Beach_Florida.html,"Vero Beach, Florida",hotels,2.0,4.5

Know your prices and expect a high pressure sales pitch!,"We had just arrived in Athens and were strolling the Plaka when I saw a gold necklace in the window of this store.

They knew we just arrived & were only there for the day. We paid almost double the price the necklace cost at other stores in Athens. We should have known better.

Very disappointed with service on a a special occasion,"We have previously dined at several Il Mulino's including the one in Nashville. Our reservation this time was for a very special occasion.

It took 30 minutes for our appertizers to arrive by which time we were about finished with the wine. It would take another 40 minutes for our entrees to arrive, and only after asking several times as to what the hold up was. We were told they were busy, however there were several empty tables at the time. The manager came by to apologize and offer to comp us for desserts. We did not see the sommelier again although we were interested in a second bottle of wine to go with our entrees. It was another 20 minutes when we were given dessert menus but after 15 minutes of waiting for the server to take our order we decided to leave. The bill came within 2 minutes of asking, the only prompt part of the service. Upon leaving we spoke to the manager about the very poor level of service to which we received a ""I'm sorry"" Needless to say a ruined experience for a special night.

"Beautiful, quiet resort, Excellent friendly service","My teen daughter and I spent 5 days at the Zoetry Punta Cana! The weather was beautiful and the setting was perfect. We wanted a quiet all inclusive as I wanted to avoid the crazy Spring Break partying. This resort fit the bill.

Juan, our butler, was thoughtful and attentive. When he found out we were celebrating an early HS graduation for my daughter, he had a cake and champagne sent to our room. Juan kept in touch to ensure all our needs were met. The maids, wait staff and grounds people were all friendly and helpful.

We reserved a Junior garden suite which was spacious and clean. Despite the fact that the resort was 95% booked, we were always able to find a chaise at the pools and at the beach without having to go down early to get one. There is plenty of shaded and sunny areas at the beach and at the pools.

I had a massage and my daughter, a facial, at the Zoetry spa. Both were excellent. The food at the 4 restaurants were also excellent and way above our expectations for an all inclusive. We also took a yoga class on the beach which was relaxing.

"Beautiful place, excellent service!","Our family of 4 stayed here in 2 rooms for 2 nights. My husband and I stayed in the Nicoya Suite which is highly recommended with a beautiful view from the balcony. Just be aware that there are alot of steps which may be an issue for the elderly or disabled.
Our kids had a forest superior room which was also very nice, spacious and clean, just a few steps.

The staff were very welcoming and helpful. We enjoyed the hotel and their restaurant which we ate in for breakfast each morning and once for dinner.

The hotel arranged for Frazier to pick us up from the airport one day , conduct a private tour of the canopy, zipline & hummingbird exhibit and another day drive us to our next destination. Frazier made our trip. His English was excellent, his knowledge of history, biology, the animals and area were impressive. Frazier recommended 2 places to stop for lunch, both delicious and a good value. We also had a night hike with Jason who also was very knowledgable, patient & fun.

We would highly recommend the services and the hotel.",December 2017,Hotel Belmar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g951347-d302957-Reviews-Hotel_Belmar-Monteverde_Province_of_Puntarenas.html,"Monteverde, Costa Rica",hotels,5.0,4.5

Great pizza!,We were a bit skeptical about getting great pizza in Hawaii. The pizza was great and there is such a variety of toppings! The service was quick.

Great Zipline Trip!,"We had a great day with our guides, Sean and Thomas! This company is very professional and focused on safety. I have ziplined before but am afraid of heights. The guides were patient with everyone. This is the only zipline I know of where you can zip upside down (I didn't , but the rest of my family did). I was able to zip backwards and do the superman because I was so comfortable with the guides and the company. Will defintely do this again!",June 2017,Koloa Zipline,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60621-d3633205-Reviews-Koloa_Zipline-Koloa_Kauai_Hawaii.html,"Kauai, Hawaii",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great value and service,"This location was perfect for a college tour. The hotel was clean, staff friendly and efficient. The price was a good value. A Breakfast buffet was included in the price and consisted of eggs, bacon, make your own waffles, oatmeal, whole fruit, hard boiled eggs & muffins .

"Great service, good value, friendly owners","We stayed in the master suite for 2 nights. Kelly gave us a warm welcome and tour of the place. There is always coffee, tea, water and soda available in the common area. Our bedroom and bathroom were clean and spacious. There was a new smart TV in our room (hbo,netflix, etc) and a refrigerator with water and soda.

Kenny made a great breakfast each morning. There was yogurt, fruit, granola, cereal, muffins & croissants each day. In addition, Kenny would make eggs to order and one day had 2 tasty quiches. Breakfast is served from 9-10am.

We did not use the pool but it looked very clean and there was an inviting hammock in the pool area. The location of the B&B was perfect for us; only 5 miles from Westhampton. There is also a good restaurant, Trumpets, on the same street within walking distance. Parking was free and always available, also free internet.

We would definitely recommend this B&B and plan to stay there again.

"Excellent food, will definitely visit again","We had a memorable dinner at Peruca's. We tried the wild boar stew and risotto with truffles which was delicious. The restaurant offers 2 seatings; around 7:30 & 9:30pm although if there are empty tables they will seat you. We were seated at 7:30pm and the service was very good. However, as the tables were turning over as we finished, it took a long time to obtain the check and pay. This did not detract from the overall experience as the food was superb, the restaurant is charming and the location perfect. We look forward to eating there again.",May 2016,Ristorante Peruca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187901-d1479189-Reviews-Ristorante_Peruca-San_Gimignano_Tuscany.html,"San Gimignano, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Good food, poor service","We had lunch outdoors at this cafe. We would have given this cafe one star had it not been for the food. It took 25 minutes to take our order, 35 minutes to obtain water, a total of 50 minutes before our food arrived. The waiter said they were very busy and apologized. However, the inside tables were nearly empty when we arrived but the outside tables were full.

The pizza and salad we ordered were delicious and very fresh. I would suggest only eating here if the majority of tables are empty or if you would prefer to linger for an hour or so.",May 2016,Caffe le Logge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580240-d3206373-Reviews-Caffe_le_Logge-Greve_in_Chianti_Tuscany.html,"Greve in Chianti, Italy",restaurants,2.0,3.0
"Fabulous small hotel, wonderful, warm service","We just spend 3 days in San Gimignano at the Casa Torre Margherita. We reserved the top room with a balcony, I cannot recall the name. This is a small hotel, 6 rooms which we thought was a plus. We arrived late as our flight was delayed. Reception stayed open to greet us even though it was a Saturday night. The hotel is centrally located with plenty of restaurants, stores, small grocery on the same street. Please note visitors must park outside the city however if you are staying overnight you are allowed to drive right up to the hotel to unload your luggage and then park.

The room had a priceless view of the Tuscan Valley. Please be advised that there is no elevator (3 floors) which was no problem for us. The receptionist insisted on helping with our luggage. The room was spacious, clean and the bedding was upscale. We had mentioned that we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and we were surprised with a bottle of wine in our room on arrival. While there is no minibar, the hotel has a large refrigerator which you can purchase water, etc on the honor system. You can also store your own drinks/food in that refrigerator and the hotel provides labels. Free wifi is offered.

The breakfast was very good, with boiled eggs, fresh cheese, meats, cereals, croissants, espresso, cappuccino, etc. Take breakfast on the terrace which also has a priceless view of the valley. We will definitely visit again!

Excellent Isles of Capri Tour,"We kayaked on the Isles of Capri with Tom. He was patient and very knowledgeable. We are a family of 5 with a wide range of kayak experience. We all loved kayaking through the Mangrove tunnels. We saw dolphin, birds, mullet flying fish, etc. Tom was an excellent guide and the main reason I selected Naples Kayak. Also the groups are smaller at Naples Kayak than their competitor.",December 2015,Naples Kayak Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34467-d1783148-Reviews-Naples_Kayak_Company-Naples_Florida.html,"Naples, Florida",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Very professional, reliable and enjoyable!","I booked a personal tour with an official guide for 2 days. One to Sintra/Cabo da Roca & one to Tomar, Obidos & the surrounding areas. Lucas was prompt and courteous in scheduling, answering questions and was flexible to my changes. Sonia was an excellent guide; again flexible, knowledgable & just a joy to spend time with. They even gave me their cell phone numbers in case I needed help during the remainder of my stay.

Worth the trip!,"The Convento de Cristo in Tomar is out of the way but an amazing place. Full of history, a beautiful chapel, 6 cloisters.
