One special place,"The acropolis is one special place that you need to visit during your stay in Athens.

If you do not know it or you plan not to visit, well... get to know it and visit it!",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Dont miss it,"The museum is already beautiful from the outside but as you enter, thousands of years of rich Greek history suddenly rushes to you.

The exibitions are beautiful and rich, the place is clean and well attended for.

It's a must see if you are in Athens.",September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
It was ok,"We sat at the location on the Champs Elisee.
We had to wait 20min to be seated but it was not really worth the wait. Food and drinks are not bad but also nothing special so we could have gone to many other places where we did not need to wait for a table.",August 2019,Ladurée,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d19340121-Reviews-Laduree-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Just incredible,"If you pass on the fact that a few artifacts in the Louvre have been stolen during the past centuries, the place is nothing short of amazing.

The venue itself is special, in the heart of paris and in the on the premises of the old royal palace.

The expositions are enormous, diverse and rich. It would take you weeks to see the whole museum properly.

The down side is that the Louvre is always, continuosly busy. There is no break. Buy your tickets online to benefit from faster entry.",August 2019,Louvre Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188757-Reviews-Louvre_Museum-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing (but requires hard work),"The place is just amazing. We stopped several times in awe during our descent to admire the view and take countless pictures. The water is as beautiful and clean as they come.

However. It is always busy. We arrived by car, had to park about 3km before the descent even started, so we had to walk a total of 5-6km. On the way down is fine, on the way up it was really tough if you are not a hiker or really fit. We saw multiple people feeling sick. The ascent is tough, which kind of ruins everyone's experience.

My suggestion is to take a boat trip instead. From the nearby town they have daily cruises to the lagoon, that way you'll enjoy the place without the hardship of having to hike back up 5km. When arriving by boat, you can al2ways walk up 2-300mt to take pictures from above, so you dont have to miss the scenic view.",September 2019,Balos Lagoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1028265-d1549927-Reviews-Balos_Lagoon-Kissamos_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very good food,"The first restaurant we ended up to upon arriving in Karpathos.

The owner is super friendly, such a lovely woman.

The food is tasty, fresh and traditionally Greek with a couple of local dishes too.

Relaxing place.",September 2019,Marina's Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189440-d3434945-Reviews-Marina_s_Restaurant-Karpathos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Kárpathos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Amazing water,"Very peaceful beach blessed with super clean turquoise waters.

One of the best places in Karpathos, I'll be back to enjoy this corner of paradise.",September 2019,Damatria Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1188925-d7160673-Reviews-Damatria_Beach-Karpathos_Town_Pigadia_Karpathos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Kárpathos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Such a peaceful place,"Let me start by saying that the personnel is very friendly and attentive. This year we had two girls attending the tables, one from Slovakia and one from Albania, both of them very lovely.

The food is simple Greek food, but super tasty and super fresh. Cant beat that.

The location: perfect. You sit in a veranda under the leaves, overlooking the Aegean. The garden is simple but neat and nicely designed. It's just a place you'd like to own and enjoy your retirement at.",September 2019,Under The Trees,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189440-d3387479-Reviews-Under_The_Trees-Karpathos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Kárpathos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
You need to try this,"A place that even at full capacity doesnt feel crowded or noisy.

The food selection is perfect, as it is for the wines.

The food quality is top and the service is really good.

We truly enjoyed our time there and will be certainly back.",May 2019,restaurant ONE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188576-d3165253-Reviews-Restaurant_ONE-Roermond_Limburg_Province.html,"Roermond, The Netherlands",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Nice,"The lounge itself is very nice and it is obviously new as the entire airport.

At times it can be really busy and the food selection is just sufficient.

They offer some entertainment such as TVs or table tennis, they offer comfy chairs and tables, they offer small and quiet work stations for one/two persons and they have a couple of meeting rooms as well.

They offer free wifi.",January 2020,IGA Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293974-d20147326-Reviews-IGA_Lounge-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",attractions,4.0,3.5
A good way to travel to the US,"So, the flight BRU-DUB is the standard European flight, where business class has the middle seat empty for comfort of the window and aisle passengers.
The DUB-LAX part is operated by refurbished A330 aircraft. The business class is basically new, confortable but in the laying position is not as comfortable as it should be. Room is limited, so movements are also limited. I'll fly it again, but seats could and should be better.
Lounges: AerLingus doesn't have their own lounges except for DUB. So, in BRU you are welcome to the BA lounge. Never seen such a dirty and filthy lounge as this one before, horrible, still get goose bumps to think of it.
The lounge in DUB is nice. A bit busy being their home base, but nice no doubt about it.
The lounge in LA: you (still to date) receive a voucher to enter the Delta lounge. However, this partnership has ended and you are re-directed to the Virgin Atlantic lounge, just 5 meters further. What a wonderful experience. The lounge doesnt offer a buffet, but rather a la carte menu and the quality of food is a good restaurant level. Absolutely my fav lounge.
Immigration: it's very nice to clear US customs in DUB, before the long flight takes place. So after landing in LA, after being obviously tired from the 9(ish) hour flight, you just walk out to collect your luggage without having to deal with trillions of passengers arriving from every corner of the world.",November 2019,Aer Lingus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8728986-Reviews-Aer-Lingus,World,flights,4.0,3.5
Really a cozy place,"We enjoyed just about everything at this restaurant: the people, super friendly.
The venue, very nicely located and decorated, it's cozy and welcoming with outdoor seating.
The food, really cooked tradionally, full of taste and freshly made.",August 2019,La Rose de Damas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d3611044-Reviews-La_Rose_de_Damas-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Real middle easter food,"Very friendly people, very tasty food but most importantly, cooked true to its origins.
Everything was freshly cooked, even at lunch, when we were only 3 customers.
For dinner, you may want to make a reservation though.",September 2019,Ristorante Aladino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187849-d1607080-Reviews-Ristorante_Aladino-Milan_Lombardy.html,"Milan, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Family style food,"The owner, who attends the tables together with his son, is very knowleageble and explain the dishes with passion.
The food is typical from the region, all is freshly cooked and it's family-like food, it's comfort food. Very earthy and tasty.
The menu changes regularly, also following the season's pickings.",February 2020,Il Covo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1933279-d3621780-Reviews-Il_Covo-Osnago_Province_of_Lecco_Lombardy.html,"Osnago, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Finally a manaish,"After the bad experience in Dubai (same chain) we had our manaish zaatar and cheese in Doha and this time it was very nice.
Just do not order eggs, in Qatar they simply do not know how to cook them",February 2020,"Zaatar w Zeit, Souq Waqif",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294009-d4004616-Reviews-Zaatar_w_Zeit_Souq_Waqif-Doha.html,"Doha, Qatar",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Dont order the manaish,"I ordered the manaish zaatar & cheese. I had to throw it away.
Far too oily, way too much zaatar that made the manaish inedible.
Luckily I had better the next time I tried that in Doha",January 2020,Zaatar w Zeit - Mall of the Emirates,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d3921076-Reviews-Zaatar_w_Zeit_Mall_of_the_Emirates-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Nice for a family lunch,"We had a lovely lunch with friends (party of 10) and it was very relaxing sitting on the balcony overlooking the fountain and Burj Khalifa.
Food was good as well as the service. Price just above mid-range",January 2020,Bebabel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d15015495-Reviews-Bebabel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,4.0,4.0
You need time,"The hotel is not bad, we had a junior suite and it was more than fine. Staff was friendly and there is ample free parking,
However, the hotel is situated right at the end of the Dubai Marina (hence far from just about anything but Bluewaters island) and it's located on a peninsula with two streets in but just ONE out and in peak hours, despite being only 5-600mt from the highway entrance (Sheikh Zayed Rd), it might take you up to 45min before you actually get there. Plan accordingly the day you fly out or if you plan appointments",January 2020,Wyndham Dubai Marina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d9704275-Reviews-Wyndham_Dubai_Marina-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,4.5
Mixed feelings,"The hotel is situated right at the sea, it has a beautiful beach and outdoor dining area, plus a good number of nice pools. Right outside the hotel you have a good choice of restaurants.
On the down side, rooms seem to bit a bit 'tired', a tea bag (Lipton) will set you back nearly 10US$ and it is a bit far from the city center. I have seen nicer Mövenpicks before so i was slightly disappointed, but it was not a bad stay.
Most importantly, our room had ZERO privacy. A number of balconies belonging to different rooms directly faced our window. We therefore needed to keep the curtains shut at all times. soundproofing could and should be a lot better.",January 2020,Movenpick Hotel & Resort Al Bida'a Kuwait,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g488160-d645249-Reviews-Movenpick_Hotel_Resort_Al_Bida_a_Kuwait-Salmiya_Hawalli_Governorate.html,"Salmiya, Kuwait",hotels,3.0,4.5
The place to stay,"The hotel is new and beautiful, located literally 2min walk from the restaurants promenade and the sea. It's family run and everyone is so kind and helpful. It's totally fairly priced and super clean. We loved our stay and we'll be back.",September 2019,Aeolia Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1188925-d18850090-Reviews-Aeolia_Suites-Karpathos_Town_Pigadia_Karpathos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Kárpathos, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
A hidden gem,Top quality food for an incredibly affordable price. A must try restaurant. We truly enjoyed every dish we ordered over multiple visits.

One incredible experience,"The place nears perfection. Except for one waiter at the bar who either did not like her job or was not trained well enough, everything made our stay truly special. The personnel is friendly and helpful, the hotel is beautiful, well maintained, relaxing and overall silent, access to a beautiful beach, multiple pools, nice restaurants and and overall ambiance reminiscent of the best middle eastern fairy tales. Needless to say, the room was spotless clean and the room-service food was above average. Highly recommended.",January 2020,Sharq Village & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294009-d622248-Reviews-Sharq_Village_Spa-Doha.html,"Doha, Qatar",hotels,5.0,4.5
Truly disappointing,"The place looks great, and the food LOOKS very nice although in tiny portions.
However, I am not sure the waiters were having a bad day or if it is the standard, but the service was just HORRIBLE. Mistakes, dropping food on two guests, forgetting items, being very clumsy and intrusive while serving... just a very poor show given how important they think they are",January 2020,Babel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g488160-d11915794-Reviews-Babel-Salmiya_Hawalli_Governorate.html,"Salmiya, Kuwait",restaurants,3.0,4.5

Horrible,"The waitress did not know their food and the food itself was truly horrible, even the coffee was not right. Incredible how self important and pompous the place wants to be but how they fail miserably to deliver any resemblance of good service or food",January 2020,Chac'Late,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294009-d7178075-Reviews-Chac_Late-Doha.html,"Doha, Qatar",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Were different centuries meet,"Lindos is a very picturesque place to visit. The town is cute, with lots of shops and tavernas, the acropolis filled with historical significance both from the Ancient Greek age and the crusades times.
