Not again,"Me and my husband were here for 2 nights with another 2 couples. Not very friendly, poor breakfast, no fridge in the room and definitely no pool. The bathroom is very small, it was really hard to get in there. The walls between the rooms are very thin, we could here what the neighbors were talking or if the phones were ringing.
They have horses, cows, dogs, cats, a rooster and 2 hens.
I liked the view, the mountains and the green grass.",July 2019,Tourist24,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1572389-d1727020-Reviews-Tourist24-Rosegg_Carinthia_Austrian_Alps.html,"Rosegg, Austria",hotels,3.0,2.5
Relaxing,"I find a walk in Plaka is relaxing. We were looking for a Greek restaurant, so we walk a couple of blocks as we passed by many trees with oranges, local shops, hotels and restaurants.",April 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Once in a lifetime,"If someone goes to Athens, visiting old Acropolis is a must do. What I didn't like: there is a little bit of chaos because there is no circuit. In April were too many people. But the historical part and the columns are just stunning, remarkable.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Best museum in Athens,"An interesting combination between old and modern. In a modern (even futuristic) building with the newest technology I could see the entire history of Greece and their Gods. After visiting old Acropolis, the museum explains all the history and everything becomes more coherent. I strongly recommend the visit of this museum.",April 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Delicious,"Very good traditional food, wine and very helpful and friendly staff. We enjoyed the starters, principal dishes and home made roze wine.",April 2019,Dio Dekares i Oka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6721199-Reviews-Dio_Dekares_i_Oka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
