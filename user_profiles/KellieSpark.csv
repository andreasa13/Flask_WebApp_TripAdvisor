A place to time travel...fantastic!,"When we went we did not feel that it was overly crowded - there was room to take pictures and plently of places to get away from the people and sit and admire the history in every direction.

Good shoes recommend and take time to look down at the ""streets"" as they are amazing and bit of a trip hazard.

You really do feel transported here and it is a must see when in Rome.",September 2019,Palatine Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190996-Reviews-Palatine_Hill-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent Value.,"This was a very good tour that was efficiently run with loads of great information. Everything was well paced with plently of time for photographs and to take in the sites. Our guide was very engaging and really knew her stuff, she spoke clearly and had supporting documents in her folder that really built the picture around the remaining bones.

At the end of the time our guide passed on other information about other things to see and do, places to eat and how to get home. All very much appreciated.

Would highly recommend this tour as you woudl not get this all done on your own.",September 2019,Skip the Line: Colosseum Small Group Tour with Roman Forum & Palatine Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187791-d11449756-Skip_the_Line_Colosseum_Small_Group_Tour_with_Roman_Forum_Palatine_Hill-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",activities,5.0,4.5
Excellent - Very Well Run,"Firstly, I have no religion so for me this was a history / art tour (before we started) afterwards I had to admit that it is indeed a very spiritual experience to be in these amazing places.

Our guide was Oscar and he was amazing - very informative, happy to have a laugh and to answer questions. It must be a tough gig to keep people on track, in sight and happy in a place that is so interesting (so many places to wander off), and teeming with people. Well done to him!

I could have stayed in the Museum for about a year - there is that much to see! I was rendered speechless by the collections and the enormity of it all. That happens well...never! I got a sore neck from looking up and trying not to miss anything to the sides or even on the floor.

The Sistine Chapel was lovely but so crowded - of course though it is a must see and I am very glad that we took the time to appreciate this stunning and famous site.

St. Peter's was deeply touching - such a grand and glorious building that makes you feel very humble and thoughtful. I wish I could have stayed here longer - but in silence. Just beautiful and very moving.

A great tour - very well done!

Beautiful - Great People Watching,"We come here to start a tour and luckily we were very early so we had a chance to really appreciate this stunning area of the city. Near to museums and some lovely places to eat the Piazza is open and has beautiful fountains and statues.

Magical - Take Your Time,"The Forum was just a magical place to be - the history and the archeology are so ""real"" here like you have been transported back to time long past. Be prepared to take your time and take it all it - there is a lot to see and lots of people seeing it with you; but if you are patient you find a quiet spot every now and again and it all just is incredible.

Make sure to climb high to take in the views and apprecaite the size of the site - you can also get some great pictures of the Colosseum from here.

Good shoes help and take care not to trip over the street stones. Read up or get a good guide as it makes all the difference. There are drinking fountains in the Forum so fill up for free.

Icon of History,"Magnificent - but you really need a great guide or have read extensively on the subject to really get the most from your visit. A skip the line ticket is an absolute must as is a firm but polite demeanor to get through all the trinket / guide sellers out the front and on the main roads leading in.

Once inside it is a little sureal and a good opportunity to seperate the facts from the fiction regarding what went on here and who the gladiators actually were and were not.It is a testament to the Romans of the time that this was built and remains standing - it is a magnifent structure and naturally a must see when in Rome.

There is often other exhibits going on inside that can be really interesting - take the time to seek them out and learn a little more.",September 2019,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very beautiful but overcrowded,"The fountain itself is very beuatiful but the massive overcrowding, pushing and shoving and trying to step over the poor people begging was a little oppressive. I found it very sad that people were that absorbed with getting a picture that they were literally falling over the beggars.

Friendly and welcoming,"We were staying about 200 meters away from this little gem and had some lovely snacks, drinks and even lunch here over the week of our stay. The service was great (very friendly, sort of like you were extended family).

There was always a great atmosphere in this little space - day or night. The cocktails were great and the food was very nice. They were also happy to do takeway for us which was great after some long, long days touring around the city.

Fantastic Neighbourhood,"We stayed in this neighbourhood during our time in Rome and it was delighful, captivating and we loved it. Always a cafe to stop at, a shop to explore, people watching to die for and tiny streets to get lost in.

Walking around is safe and easy - although the streets can get you a little turned around. Treat it as an adventure and it will be grand.

There is so much to see and do, eat and enjoy. When we return to Rome we will stay again for sure.",September 2019,Trastevere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190123-Reviews-Trastevere-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent - Thanks Migle!,"What a wonderful day we had with the amazing Migle as our guide - a lovely young lady who is a credit to herself and an asset to the City Wonders Team.

We left on time (I love this!) and were given a very detailed game plan for the day which was much apprecited. Bus was comfortable and well appointed and the driver very skilled (anyone who can get that much bulk up and down Vesuvius without a scratch is a legend!).

We had a short break both on the way down and back for a toilet stop and a snack which was great. It is a very long day so a leg stretch is great (and of course coffee!)

Our firs stop was Mt Vesuvius which was wonderful and you had time to make it to the top and do pictures without any issues. Migle was informative and had a great quick wit - she was a delight. It is a bit croweded at times and good shoes are really a must as it can be rather slip and slide in parts.

Next onto a lovely lunch in Naples - a bit rushed but the food was good and there was plently of it.

Pompeii was magical and all that we had hoped it would be - I dont think you could ever spend enough time here but the time we had was well used. The guide we got for this section was also a very clever young lady and she really knew her stuff. It was a great experience and a must do. Even out Master 14 had a great time and really enjoyed seeing what he had learnt at school ""come to life"".

After exiting Pompeii there is plenty of places to grab a drink but if you need to use the toilets line up right away as the line is long at all times.

Breathtaking - A Real Fortress,"This place is exactly what comes to mind when you think of a fortress made to protect and take in the surrounding villages at times of invasion. It is large and open on the insdie with walls and a location to withstand and hold.

The ride up on the tractor carts from the car park is lovely and gives you an indication of how hard it would have been to breach the fortress when it was with horses and infantry. Once at the top and before entering there is some cute little shops - grab a drink (or wait until you are inside as there is other places).

The place is well preserved and has views to die for - the local artisans that sell from in here were not pushy and allowed time to browse. All in all it was a facinating place to be and we were very glad that we made the trip.",September 2019,Rasnov Citadel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g946544-d4223554-Reviews-Rasnov_Citadel-Rasnov_Brasov_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Rasnov, Romania",attractions,5.0,4.0
Great Lunch - Excellent Service,"Having walked to this area to do some shopping we come to the roof top and found an array of places to eat - and decided on La Lola! This was a great decision (thanks to Master 14) as the experience was wonderful.

We were served by a lovely young lady who was professional beyond her years, knew the menu well and made good suggestions for both food and drink. As my partner wanted paella she was very clear in telling us it was a twenty minute wait as each dish was cooked fresh - bonus and exactly what we wanted.

Food portions were generous and very tasty - nice check in from our waitress without being in your face. Drinks were great. As busy as the place was we did not feel pushed to vacate the table and we were asked if we wanted more food or drinks and not left to ponder.

Given the location the pricing was very good and we would highly recommend.",October 2019,La Lola de las Arenas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d2423526-Reviews-La_Lola_de_las_Arenas-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Wow - to beautiful for words,"As you see this little stunner from the road it already is awe inspiring - even on the day we were there in the overcast weather and rain. Actually it might have even made it more mystical.

Boat ride across - imagine that it can get busy but not on the day we were there (bad weather does have some advantages). This is a place that even if you are not religious feels special and with the views of the surrounding area well worth the visit",October 2019,Our Lady of the Rocks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304087-d548922-Reviews-Our_Lady_of_the_Rocks-Perast_Kotor_Municipality.html,"Perast, Montenegro",attractions,5.0,4.5
Spectacular Views with Amazing Food.,"We had driven down from Mlini, Croatia for the day as the weather was wet and we still wanted to get out and do something. So, we just started driving down through Montenegro. What a glorious drive and adventure it was - even in the rain and low clouds the wild beauty of this area shone through.

We got to Perast and parked to walk down into the town...and the heavens really looked like they were about to open. We picked this place to eat and again we really got lucky! First I was not exactly dressed for the sudden drop in temperature and I was immediately given the most lucious blanket to wrap around myself - so happy.

Our lovely waiter then gave us his suggestions from the menu which we took on board and went with that, including his suggestions for wine and beer. The magnificent fish was cooked and bought to the table where is was filleted and placed on the plate for us along with out side veggies. It was decadent and tasted amazing - while eating there was the loudest thunderstorm and rain pelted down. Didn't matter it was like it just made it all the more fun.

We have made going back to Montenegro a must - and of course a visit to this restaurant will be at the top of our to do list for that visit.

Well done to all the staff x",October 2019,Conte Hotel Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g304087-d2200654-Reviews-Conte_Hotel_Restaurant-Perast_Kotor_Municipality.html,"Perast, Montenegro",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A little decadent!,"We went in just before closing to get some sweets to take back to our hotel as Master 14 was getting over the day (we had done a lot). The selection was still very good and it was probably good that it was not fully stocked as my waist line was already in holiday expansion mode.

We picked out an array of goodies which were packed up for us to takeaway without fuss or bother. We also got take away coffee which was of good quality.

The goodies were amazing - so fresh and yummy.

Breathtaking!,"What a delightful and amazing place to wander around and absorb the history of this town. I could have stayed here for days with the lovely buildings, history and cafes all inside the walls.

It was very interesting that people still live, work and go to school here and some of the homes were gorgeous. I can only imagine what it must be like at night after the tourists have left and the locals remain.

I would highly recommend a visit - spend some time though, have a coffee, walk and then have cake.

A Medieval Delight,"Dating from the 14th Century the museum inside houses some great pieces from the medieval period. The building itself reflects the period with walls made to withstand anything at 2 metres thick! Climbing up the stairs delighted Master 14 as they were in places challenging but great fun.

The view from the platform at the top was beautiful and it was great to see the time icons up close as well as the clock mechanism.

Certainly a must see and do!",September 2019,Sighișoara Clock Tower,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g311309-d558448-Reviews-Sighisoara_Clock_Tower-Sighisoara_Mures_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Sighisoara, Romania",attractions,5.0,4.5
Decent Meal - Service Lacking,"We ate here twice - the first time we had lunch with our Romanian guide and we had great service and the meal was really nice. We opted to sit inside as it was a little chilly - it was nicely decorated but the music from the television made it hard to have a conversation. The meal size was very good - the price was as expected so close to the old town.

When we went back for dinner without our guide the servie did a 180 and was completely lacking. The food also was not as good - very salty and not as nice. Portion size was still good.

It is not that I would not recommend but it would be worth trying others in the area as there is no lack of options.",September 2019,Concordia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g311309-d4324641-Reviews-Concordia-Sighisoara_Mures_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Sighisoara, Romania",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Fantastic Place!,"The drive up to this beautiful village and the Fortified Church is stunning in itself. Then once you get the to village itself you are transported via the UNSECO site of the Church itself into another time.

This is a very well preserved location - great views and loads of history to absorb. We were here on a day that was not overly bsuy which made it all the more special as there was quite spaces and it was then that you really could feel the place.

Loved the Ham House and the Special Locks. A beautiful place to visit and spend a few hours.

You will not find better!,"When you book on line for a place that is literally half way around the world you never know what to expect...then you come to Villa Ana and your expectations are exceeded a million times over (and you never want to leave, ever)!

From the moment we arrived and Carol was waiting for us at the steps to the hugs upon our departure this place was amazing and now holds a very special place in our hearts.

The apartment we had (the largest one) was very well appointed, spotlesly clean, had heaps of room and the view from the balcony is worth ""a million dollars"". There is everything you need to self cater, the beds are compfy and the shower was excellent with great water pressure. We wanted for nothing.

In addition - the family restuarant right below the apartments is the absolute best ever! And the family is more than happy to help with any questions or needs you might have. We cannot recommend this gem highly enough and our only regret is that we left to come home.",October 2019,Villa Ana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g658382-d1566745-Reviews-Villa_Ana-Mlini_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Mlini, Croatia",hotels,5.0,5.0
"Outstanding Food, Warm and Friendly Service","Lets start with the location and the ambience of this little gem - overlooking the little Port of Mlini and the stunning sea if you are lucky the windows will be open and you will be blessed with a sea breeze and a stunning twilight by which to eat. If it is cooler then rug up and enjoy the warmth that eminates from the staff and the kitchen.

Moving onto the service - outstanding. Staff are very knowledgable and are happy to make recommendations if you are undecided. I love a place that tells you if you have overordered instead of just letting you waste money and food. To me this is all class and this is the case here.

The food - the glorious home cooked delightful tasy food! If you believe that food that is cooked with love tastes better then you have that here in spades. Locally sourced and seasonal every dish we ate here over five days was sublime and tasty. Portions were of a very good size but always just enough space for desert. A great drinks selection as well.

Just outstanding - everyone associated with this gem should be very proud of how they represent the produce and food of Croatia.",October 2019,Konoba Lanterna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g658382-d1948682-Reviews-Konoba_Lanterna-Mlini_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Mlini, Croatia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Lunch - Very Friendly,"Although this place does cater to large groups we were only three and still got amazing personalised service with a smile. It was delightful sitting under the shade of the front verandah and looking out over the street and country side.

Service was prompt and efficient - the toilets were clean and well maintained.

Food was absolutley delicious and some wonderful choices were available.

Old streets with trendy themes,"We stayed in this area - it was very vibrant and had a great feeling of joy and fun especially in the evening when the bars and restaurants come alive and people strolled around before and after dinner.

The strong police presence was both a comfort but made you wonder why they were needed? In anycase we did not see any trouble of any kind so we were happy to join in the fun - even Master 14 who can get nervous in a crowd was happy.

There are some wonderful little shops, the cobblestone streets and older buildings are so sweet.

Stunning & Facinating - In a haunting way.,"First - we had an amazing guide who was witty and funny, and not too afraid to poke a little fun and what we could and could not see in the Palace. It was a very entertaining and informative tour and worth the time and effort for sure. He was happy to answer questions and was very engaging.

The building / monlith / ego journey that is the actual Palace is stunning with breathtaking spaces and decor. The architecture is grand on a scale that is borderline sureal. Just when you thought it could not get grander (or harder to heat) the next room was all that and more.

Having spent a week in rural Romania prior to this and having heard the stories of the suffering under Nicolae Ceaușescu you actually felt a bit ill knowing that why everyone suffered so badly they had to watch millions being poured into this vanity project.

Hosiptality - plus the best food in Athens!,"After arriving late into Athens we stubbled out of out hotel and into this place for dinner. As tired as we were the vibe of the space and the kindness and openess of the staff bought us right back to life!

The menu was fantastic and considering the location and the quality of the food and serive we felt the pricing was very good. Master 14 was a little grumpy from a long day and flight but when he put the first mouthful of his dinner in his mouth he was back in happy land!

We ended up eating here a few more times and each time it was just fantastic - food, service, location and atmosphere all spot on. Now that we are home and have rated out top eats of our four week tour of Europe this place is in our top five. And maybe (just maybe) we have already planned out next holiday to Greece in 2021 with many return visits to this place at the front of our minds.

Fantastic Hotel - Right in the action!,"Stayed two nights at the begining and end of out time in Greece and could not be more grateful that we did. Very responsive to prebooking emails with information and pricing - booked direct with the hotel and easy and faultless process.

Upon arrival which was later in the evening the service was wonderful with both our bookings being done in the one go so that when we come back we would not have to waste time!

Our rooms on both occassions were the family ones which we large and roomy - great bathrooms and accessories. Having the two bathrooms and sleeping areas really impressed Master 14! That in itself speaks volumes :) We had balconies in both instances with views up and down the street to watch the life of the city.

Staff on all occassions were generous with thier time, kind and welcoming. This is always appreciated.

Breakfast was decent and there was plenty to go around - only very small suggestion would be for larger coffee cups. Aside from this very, very minor suggestion it was delightful.

Location, location, location! Does not get any better for this price. Across the street are some amazing places to eat - they actually need to be much further away so you can walk off all the yummy food before heading back to the hotel! Post Office just up the road, good access to laundrymat within one kilometer. And if you want to save some money on airport transfers catch the bus as it stops a five minute (if that) walk from the hotel. You can also stroll to some cool archeological sites from here on your morning walk (to walk off dinner) before you start again for the day. The area around the hotel felt safe and easy to get around.

We arrived mid afternoon and it was quite warm so a cold drink to carry around is a must. The site was busy but not over crowded but I imagine that it could get very busy and this would not be as pleasant an experience.

Master 14 really enjoyed it and this is not an easy thing to achieve so it must be good. My partner really loved it without having the historical knowledge he still found it awe inspiring and as a martial aritist loved the battle stories and the information about the renowned warriors that lived and died here.

There are some great artifacts and also replicas that really help to imagine what life must have been like and how advanced the Greeks really were.

Interesting - A Large Site Worth Exploring,"This was a really interesting site - and one that I had not given much thought to before arriving but it was worth a visit for sure. We were here a little later in the afternoon so the weather was great and the site not over crowded.

Interesting that modern medicine takes so much from what was learnt and practiced here - also given that it was a place of wholistic healing it would seem that we have come full circle.

It is a large site but there is a good shop at the front for drinks and Master 14 was impressed with the icecream selection.

It is a humbling experience to walk around the Temple and know that so many others of importance and those that contributed so much to history have walked there before you.

Loved it.",September 2019,Temple of Apollo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189484-d232308-Reviews-Temple_of_Apollo-Corinth_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Corinth, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worth the effort! A must see in Corinth,"Firstly - good (and I mean seriously good) walking shoes and water are a must. The surface of the ground is not only uneven but the rocks very well polished and slippery. However once you have the OHS out of the way get up there and enjoy it!

This fortress dates back to the Ancient Greeks but has been unsed throughout history and once you get up there and check out the view and strategic advantage you can clearly understand why.

You notice this fortress the moment you get into the area of Ancient Corinth as it towers over the landscape. There is good parking at the top but make sure you get that water from down below as there was nothing up here when we were there.

A must see and a very impressive piece of Greek History. Do it!",September 2019,Akrokorinthos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189484-d232309-Reviews-Akrokorinthos-Corinth_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Corinth, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
WOW! Amazing to see.,"This was a bucket list item for me due to my studies - and it did not let me down at all. The history and idea of a mans insight behind this feat of engineering and the human spirit is wonderful and to stand and admire it even more so.

Even if you are not history mad - it is worth the stop to consider just what went into this canal and the impact that it has had on the region.

Of course there is also some cute little souvenier shops, a great cafe with free toilets that are clean and well maintained. There is a little kebab shop to the very right of the main building (looking at it from the car park) dont miss trying a plate of the chicken kebabs, totally delicious....even if you have just stuffed breakfast down they are a must LOL.",September 2019,Corinth Canal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1188932-d2454053-Reviews-Corinth_Canal-Isthmia_Loutraki_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Isthmia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Interesting & Informative,"This is a very well maintained and impressived site and well worth the trip out from Athens or as an inclusion on a trip further out from the city. Easily accessable and with parking available - the only must is a drink as once outside the very impressive indoor display area it is exposed and hot.

The displays are very impressive and well documented - staff on hand are happy to help and I was very pleased to see them keeping people with sticky fingers from handling the artifacts. It was not over crowded when we were here and that made taking time to read and understand the site easier. However as the morning moved on it started to get full of tour bus arrivals which takes the magic away a little. Recommed an early start.

Master 14 was impressed (hard to achieve!) so that is always a good indicator.

If nothing else the views over the sea and the landscape are amazing but there is so, so much more here. Get into it and hug some history!",September 2019,Ancient Corinth (Archaia Korinthos),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189484-d243253-Reviews-Ancient_Corinth_Archaia_Korinthos-Corinth_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Corinth, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Absolutely Beautiful - Caring and gracious hosts.,"Chanta and John made us feel like family from the moment we arrived for our night at Butterworth Farm. The grounds and the rooms are just beautiful and so well located to all the key sites for the Somme.

We recieved great information for what to see and where to go and the absolute best dinner recommendation in Albert! Lucas is still raving about the meal and rates it in his top ten after four weeks in Europe. Breakfast was very nice - and again more of a family feel rather that just a place to stay.

Thank you so much for having us - our only regret is that it was only one night. You simply are wonderful hosts with the most beautiful home.",September 2019,Butterworth Farm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1930422-d1913053-Reviews-Butterworth_Farm-Pozieres_Somme_Hauts_de_France.html,"Pozieres, France",hotels,5.0,5.0
Fantastic - A must visit.,"Located in central Albert (which is a stunning little town in itself) this Museum is just fantastic. There is so much here to look at all which really brings home the horror of war and the sacrifices made. There is a lot to see and I recommend getting in before a larger tour groups so you have some time to reflect and really take in the amazing collection.

I consider this a must see and a credit to the people of Albert and the surrounding area.

The shop at the end has a very extensive range of reading materials and little momentos that were very well priced.",September 2019,Musee Somme 1916 Admission Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g666964-d15149830-Musee_Somme_1916_Admission_Ticket-Albert_Somme_Hauts_de_France.html,"Albert, France",activities,5.0,4.5
Unknown Solidier,"Another very well looked after tribute to the young men who lost their lives in this area. The Unknown Solidier now at home in Canberra was taken from here - the grave still marked.

No words - Lest We Forget,"This was such an incrediblty moving experience - a little overwhelming at times when reading the ages of those resting here so peacefully, but such a long way from home.

The grounds and graves are so lovingly cared for - which is very understandable if you go into the village of Villers itself. They are so proud of their love for Australia.

This is a must visit - a time to reflect and remeber and to pay respects to those who fought for our country only to lie for eternity so far from home.",September 2019,Australian National Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3706266-d777274-Reviews-Australian_National_Memorial-Fouilloy_Somme_Hauts_de_France.html,"Fouilloy, France",attractions,5.0,5.0
A must see for all Aussies - just great.,"After seeing the Monash Centre and the Australian War Memorial this museum was our last stop on our WW self drive experience. It was just wonderful to see how much Australia means to the people in this area - it was heart warming and very uplifiting to think that our young diggers still mean so much.

Great meal - lovely location.,"We took a seat inside looking out to the very popular beer garden. The staff were very good, efficient and well mannered. The interior of the hotel is really nice - well looked after and clean. Rest rooms - very nice.

So onto the food - AMAZING! Good size meals for our lunch - the fish and chips was fantastic. Given the location and the amount of tourism in Bath we felt the prices were as we expected.

Balcony Room - Stunning Views,"We had a triple balcony room which was spacious, thougftfully decorated and a a view that was worth a million dollars. The rates at this hotel are super reasonable and it is in a great location to enjoy the best of Nafplion.

The service was execptional - the staff could not have been nicer.

Breakfast was amazing and again I could have spent a day in the breakfast area just looking out the windows! The selection was so good and all being prepared fresh in the kitchen across the way.

Stunning - A great place to relax and watch the sunset.,"We hired a bike for four - there was three of us so I sat in the back and let the boys do the work (great idea).

Stunning Views - Worth every step!,"We went along early in the morning and decided (due to my hip dysplacia) to walk down not up. The site is very well preserved and informative and the views are simply amazing. You need to wear good shoes what ever you do as even walking around the site is uneven and you need to really explore it.

There is rest rooms which were clean - bonus.

Walking down was great lots to see along the way but I would not want to do this in wet weather!

So very sad - but a must see.,"This museum is very well presented and priced. Obviously the subject matter is sad and confronting but it has been set up in a manner that is tasteful and very educational.

Our 14 year old son really got a lot out of this and given that WW1 and 2 are part of the Australian school curriculum it was great for him to see and understand what so many of his countrymen gave for him to have what he has today.

The interactive aspects / the displays and the feel of this place was hauting and beautiful all at once.

Held back the tears....just.,"We arrived about 45 minutes before 8pm as our guest house had advised it would be busy. This was a great idea as we still did not get right ""at the front"" but could see a great deal - and really it is more about inward reflection and thanks rather than a spectacle.

Having attended many ANZAC Day Ceremonies at home it was a privilage to stand under the names of so many brave men and to know that this village still honours them every night. Regardless of what you think about the horrors of war - at the going down of the sun and in the morning...we should remember them.

I was not as keen to move after I put the first spoonful of food in my mouth - it was amazing. You here people say you should cook with love - well this food had the love in spades!

Yes the room was large and not overly decorated but I dont eat room decor I eat food and this was food to be eaten. The service was good - they were busy so I dont expect to have a slave. Drinks were good and cold.

Pefect from start to finish!,"The amazing Diana helped me set our tour up via email from Australia and was just a dream to deal with - it was very obvious from our first correspondence that we were with the right company.

We were collected from the airport by Christian who never seems to have a bad day, has endless energy and enthusiasm for his stunning home, and is knowledgable and fun to be around. We had an absolute blast.

All accommodation was top rate, meal suggestions fantastic, and the sights and places we visited the stuff of dreams. It was facinating, engaging, and desperately sad to leave. We did also get to meet Diana for our last day in Bucharest when she showed us some of her home town prior to being taken back to the airport. What a wonderful young lady who really knows her stuff.

Very Nice - Great Service,"Wandered in here for dinner at the suggestion of Master 14 (our 14 year old son) and I was glad we did. Choices for seating either out on the square with heating and cover or in the building itself which was decorated like you were in the Greek Islands.

The menu was good - loads of options for all tastes. I also felt that give the location that the pricing was good too. Our meals arrived and the food was very nice and tasty. Master 14 approved too (this is a huge tick of approval LOL).

Just stunning! Beautiful and comfortable.,"Recieved a warm and professional welcome at arrival and it was all 100% from there. The room was so very spacious with historical features and a very comfortable bed - the bathroom very well appointed with a shower that had great water pressure.

Situated right on the stunning old town square so the location is spot on for a nice walk or to find a great meal in the dozens of options all very close by. The road out front is very busy so care when crossing advised!

Although we did not have dinner in the hotel the menu looked great and was very well priced. We did of course have breakfast which was a wonderful spread with friendly and couteous staff around to help if needed. And it was very yummy, a pefect start to the day.

We also had a morning with Elis in Athens which was also just fantastic. Again the information and passion was just so obvious and infectious.
