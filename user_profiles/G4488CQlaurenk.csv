"Good beer, average food","We went here earlier in the summer for beer and apps and were very impressed. The main menu looked really good so we returned last night. The beer was still great but were disappointed in the main course food, except the mashed potatoes were great. Ribs were cold and chicken club was dry. A good place for drinks and apps but if you want a good meal, go elsewhere.",September 2019,Abe Erb Kitchener,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g181747-d12594665-Reviews-Abe_Erb_Kitchener-Kitchener_Region_of_Waterloo_Ontario.html,"Kitchener, Canada",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Craft beer available,My partner and I each enjoyed a flight of beer. Also had lots of seasonable craft beers available that sparked our interest but we didn’t try (was a bit pricey for these seasonal options). Cool vibe and good service.,July 2019,The Townhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154971-d3474392-Reviews-The_Townhouse-Antigonish_Nova_Scotia.html,"Antigonish, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good food,Coffee was weak and disappointing but the food was good. Built my own omelette. Reasonably priced. All day breakfast available.,July 2019,Justamere Cafe and Bakery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154971-d2262170-Reviews-Justamere_Cafe_and_Bakery-Antigonish_Nova_Scotia.html,"Antigonish, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Delicious,Family run restaurant. One of the best Caesar salads I’ve ever had. Delicious pizza. Very much recommended.,June 2019,Le Cascate Pizzeria & Caffe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154998-d11892772-Reviews-Le_Cascate_Pizzeria_Caffe-Niagara_Falls_Ontario.html,"Niagara Falls, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great atnosphere,"On the waterfront, had heaters going while we visited so it was nice and warm. Mussels with mustard sauce were average, came with a lot of sauce. Friend got grilled veggies with haloumi cheese salad which came with balsamic dressing and was very good. Excellent complimentary frozen creamsicle for dessert.",April 2019,Island Basket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2184506-d7119457-Reviews-Island_Basket-Artemida_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Artemida, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Wonderful!,"Found this place on Trip Advisor under cheap eats. Definitely the best value we’ve found in Greece so far with very delicious food. The tzatziki was amazing, although quite garlicky (the waiter did warn us to his credit!). Decided to try fava here and were not disappointed. Originally ordered a Greek salad but the waiter suggested Cretan as an alternative which was very similar but with a creamier cheese and sweeter dressing. Were happy with our choices. Wine only 2 euros a glass! Complimentary dessert and shots. Clearly a family run place and so delicious. Would return!",April 2019,Ta Meraklikia tou Boureksi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d4860280-Reviews-Ta_Meraklikia_tou_Boureksi-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Unmatched service,"Were recruited off the street, took their coupon then returned later in the evening. Given complimentary wine and dessert (pear and apple slices with honey). All 3 servers upstairs were extremely attentive. Nice balcony seating. Main meals were average.",April 2019,El Greco Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d2157688-Reviews-El_Greco_Taverna-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,4.0,3.5

Poor customer service,"Barista was talking to someone (not another customer nor a colleague) while making our loose leaf tea, to the point where she would walk away from the tea to talk to him. When she served us the tea, it was only 3/4 filled with water. I asked her to fill it up all the way and she added a small amount more, still not near full, and laughed.",April 2019,Coffee Island Coffee Roasters,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189433-d10366249-Reviews-Coffee_Island_Coffee_Roasters-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Get a guide,Online tours were sold out so we arrived and noted a “licensed tour guide” right by the ticket booth. Well worth the 30 Euro per person charge to have a semi-private group (4 people) tour with our knowledgeable guide Maria. Has been doing tours for 47 years! Spoke very good English.,April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Great view, pricey food","Recommended by a family member to go for the view and that food was good. Expected it to be pricey but still managed to be a more expensive evening than anticipated. Asked if we wanted sparkling or flat water, chose sparkling. Thought we would likely have to pay for it, but when the waitress cracked a second bottle without asking us if we wanted more, we assumed it was complimentary water. Until we got our bill and 10 euros for two bottles! Ordered a salad as our main as other dinner menu items did not interest us (lamb, mushroom cabbage roll, cannelloni originally sparked my interest but then read it had oxtail in it). The “like Greek” salad was very good but average to small portion sizes. Service was also just average.",April 2019,SENSE Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12484364-Reviews-SENSE_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Clean with character!,"Friendly staff, comfortable bed, nice pillows and towels. Wifi reliable - worked for everything but Netflix. Complimentary beverages in room fridge. Kindly arranged airport transfer for me.

Enjoyed my stay hetr,"Although they did not confirm, my name was on their list upon my arrival to Tom Sai pier. Given an umbrella to shade myself from the sun while waiting for other guests before taking the longboat to the resort, which was very nice. Bed was somewhat firm but nice pillows. Generous with towels. Good complimentary breakfast - omelette made to order. Note that you can walk into town from this resort, takes 30min but is somewhat treacherous climbing over rocks and tree roots.",November 2017,Paradise Pearl Bungalows,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g303908-d1312449-Reviews-Paradise_Pearl_Bungalows-Ko_Phi_Phi_Don_Krabi_Province.html,"Ko Phi Phi Don, Thailand",hotels,4.0,3.5
Difficult to find but worth it,"Hard to find. Follow road down past Reggae bar and then look for sign that says ""shortcut to viewpoint"" - involves many stairs and then steep walkway but definitely worth the view. Don't forget you need to pay entrance fee. Someone said the mosquitoes were bad but I went at sunset and didn't have a problem.",November 2017,Koh Phi Phi Viewpoint,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303908-d4870312-Reviews-Koh_Phi_Phi_Viewpoint-Ko_Phi_Phi_Don_Krabi_Province.html,"Ko Phi Phi Don, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.5

Absolutely delicious,Excellent food - has butter chicken and naan. Kind staff. A bit more expensive than other restaurants I've been to in Thailand but the food was worth the cost.,November 2017,Kohinoor Indian Restaurant & Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1597036-d5973024-Reviews-Kohinoor_Indian_Restaurant_Pizza-Railay_Beach_Krabi_Town_Krabi_Province.html,"Railay Beach, Thailand",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great experience,Picked up at our hotel at the planned time. Wifi at the waiting area did not work but snacks and food available. Boat is very clean and staff are friendly.

Very happy with experience,"Overnight flight from Toronto and Hong Kong. On time. Pillow and blanket provided to all passengers. Two meals - supper first then breakfast, delicious as far as plane food goes...even included Haagen Daz ice cream! Plenty of entertainment options and good service. Only negative thing would be that height of seat back was too short for me (I'm 5'10) but sufficient leg room.",October 2017,Cathay Pacific,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729046-Reviews-Cathay-Pacific,World,flights,5.0,4.0
Decent,"Not as new of an aircraft for this 5 hour flight, compared to my long haul cross Pacific experience. Was told they were running out of my first choice for food so was given only other option although food is tasty for airplane food...and Haagen Daz ice cream was a bonus! Good service.

"Good food, okay service",I had the pad Thai as it came highly recommended on this forum. It was very tasty however portion was smaller than I expected. Staff were not overly friendly. Nice atmosphere with the bunnies.,October 2017,Maha Bar/Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297701-d3833167-Reviews-Maha_Bar_Restaurant-Ubud_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html,"Ubud, Indonesia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Met expectations :),A wonderful 60min Balinese massage with great service. I booked an afternoon appointment in the morning and glad that I did as when I went at 3pm the spa was quite busy. You are given a choice of which oil you would like and a foot scrub. Masseuse was very polite and asked me if I wanted my head and stomach massaged. I left feeling relaxed.,October 2017,Jaens Spa Ubud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297701-d1940511-Reviews-Jaens_Spa_Ubud-Ubud_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html,"Ubud, Indonesia",attractions,5.0,4.5
