Heidelberg,My main destination was the castle.i walked from the train station through the route there and visited shops along the way as one nears the castle area. I missed the funicular ride up so hiked a very steep route. I bought the tour and don’t know how one would get in without having the tour. The guide was knowledgable and quite humorous. Interesting castle and it’s story. There is also a museum of pharmacy which is most enlightening. The castle grounds are enormous - a beautiful area with views of the city. Rode the funicular down and visited the shops in the way back. Had coffee and pastry at a lovely tea house on the way. I found Heidelberg a charming city.,January 2020,Restaurant Hackteufel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187286-d962963-Reviews-Restaurant_Hackteufel-Heidelberg_Baden_Wurttemberg.html,"Heidelberg, Germany",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Walking tour in Frankfurt,"I thoroughly enjoyed our most informative tour of Frankfurt. Apologies that I have forgotten the name of our guide (American woman from PA, a new mom and married to German). She threaded our tour beautifully around the old town while adding much history and character of the city and its people. I enjoyed travel in Germany.",January 2020,Frankfurt on Foot Daily Walking Tour in English,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187337-d18912857-Frankfurt_on_Foot_Daily_Walking_Tour_in_English-Frankfurt_Hesse.html,"Frankfurt, Germany",activities,4.0,5.0
Symbol of democracy,"The Acropolis is the highest point in Athens and as one mounts the hill you see the Parthanon, the Erecththeion, the Propylaia and the temple of Athena. The temples honor the virgin Athena. This remarkable architecture dates back to the 5th century BC. What remains are remnants of their grandeur but they still hold their magnificence and the symbol of democracy born in Ancient Greece. The Theatre of Dionysus lies south or below the top of the hill. This was an important part of the Greeks life. I do recommend a visit to the Acropolis Museum just below the hill.",February 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Heart of the city,Had such fun in this old town where I stayed as well. The streets are narrow and winding full of small shops and restaurants. Juxtaposed to one area of fully modern stores one can find the ancient agora with hundreds of flea market/bazaar stalls and more restaurants. I found the food excellent and everything reasonably priced. Close by are the many ancient treasures of Athens. Wonderful to observe the ‘changing of the guard’ at the palace and stroll through a wonderful city park - all an easy walk.,February 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Satisfying Mexican dinner,Four of us stopped in for supper and all ordered different items. Every entree was quite satisfying and typical 'American Mexican' food. We ate outside on the patio which was pleasant and the service was good. Enjoyed our margaritas too.

Topnotch service and excellent food.,"We were a group of four and everyone enjoyed an excellent meal with superb service.

A must experience,Hudson's is a Coeur 'Alene landmark and been in the same spot for one hundred years. It is as much the experience as it is the food. There is inevitably a line up during much of the day waiting for a seat at one of a dozen or so stools inside. There is a limited menu but the hundred year process is the same and much of the experience is watching the preparation of your burger. I often note many patrons order two of their favorite burgers. It is a great burger - fresh and oh so good.,November 2013,Hudson's Hamburgers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35418-d410617-Reviews-Hudson_s_Hamburgers-Coeur_d_Alene_Idaho.html,"Coeur d'Alene, Idaho",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wonderful pizza,"Not your traditional pizza. It is quite distinct and wonderful - always tasty with a thin, crisp crust.
The service is always cordial and good. There is rarely a wait for ones order. I recommend it wholeheartedly. It is located on Sherman Avenue and a handy location for anyone. It isn't too noisy like a lot of pizza places. I like the mushroom pizza especially well.q",December 2013,Fire Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35418-d2307496-Reviews-Fire_Pizza-Coeur_d_Alene_Idaho.html,"Coeur d'Alene, Idaho",restaurants,5.0,4.5
