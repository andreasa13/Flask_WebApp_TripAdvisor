Cool place to get some Dulce de Leche,"Large selection with good prices. Here is our video tasting treats from Casa de los Dulces. WildPack Family highlights it so you can see for yourself.

Definitely a fine place in Colonial Zonal to grab souvenir treats for those back home. We tried a sampling of everything",August 2019,Casa de los Dulces,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147289-d538120-Reviews-Casa_de_los_Dulces-Santo_Domingo_Santo_Domingo_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,attractions,4.0,4.5
Wish we'd found this place earlier!,"We found this at the end of our 7 day stay in La Zona Colonial. Fun,lively place with super rich desserts. Authentic place with locals so you don't feel like a tourist. Our daughter loved their pineapple drink and dulce de leche.
We did a review sitting in the restaurant here. We sat leisurely and played games enjoying life. Service was very friendly.",August 2019,Grandâ€™s Cafeteria and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147289-d3267131-Reviews-Grand_s_Cafeteria_and_Bar-Santo_Domingo_Santo_Domingo_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,restaurants,4.0,3.5
Cool behind the scenes. Learned a good amount on the process,"Fun tour for the family.

1. Learn how the news is produced!
2. See live on air hosts working
3. Everyone along the way including news producers, anchor hosts very friendly
4. Quick tour so can squeeze in other activities like Aquarium/ World of Coke",June 2019,CNN Studio Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g60898-d11988016-CNN_Studio_Tours-Atlanta_Georgia.html,"Atlanta, Georgia",activities,4.0,3.5
Tres Ojos or your eyes won't believe it. Love the non-commercialization of it,"Our guide mentioned that parts of Jurassic Park were filmed here. Tranquil spot. We took a guide who filled in info as very little actual information on the place. Recommend paying the $.50 per person and taking the mini boat over one of the underground lakes to the other side. We did it as part of our adventure with 4 kids

Really gorgeous and humbling!",July 2019,The 3 Eyes National Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147289-d149176-Reviews-The_3_Eyes_National_Park-Santo_Domingo_Santo_Domingo_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,attractions,5.0,4.5
Good grilled food with dope view. Lots of space for family,"Our waiter gave us free tasting of sancocho soup and our kids ate it up quickly.

Next our waiter recommended for our family of 6, the special meat selection platter. It came with a variety of steak,sausage and other meats. We topped it off with orders of habichuelas (beans), rice, platanos, bottles of water and for the adults --bottles of Presidente. The view of the water was delightful. It was open air restaurant that was a highlight of our trip.",July 2019,D'Luis Parillada,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147289-d2664187-Reviews-D_Luis_Parillada-Santo_Domingo_Santo_Domingo_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,restaurants,4.0,4.0
Top level transportation service--Safe and Reasonable,"Michael our driver picked us up in Santo Domingo. While in Santo Domingo he toured us around Los Tres Ojos and various tourist spots. He drove us roundtrip from there to Las Terrenas. Michael was consistently responsive, on time and charged reasonable prices. He picked up our guests as well who visited us while we stayed in the DR for a month. We were worried, given all the news reports about DR and traveling, but Michael exceeded our expectations. He met us early in the morning and late at night. His van fit our family of 6 perfectly. Definitely recommend. Tip at any time in DR: if you have a large expense amount and using a credit card, sometimes you may need to run the card multiple times up to the amount. We noted this when working with Michael.",July 2019,Transporte Aleika,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147289-d12682967-Reviews-Transporte_Aleika-Santo_Domingo_Santo_Domingo_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,attractions,5.0,5.0
Quick stay after UGA game,"Very easy walking to the action of downtown.
I believe you get what you pay for as this is a budget motel and it operates as such. The shower sprayed water out of the top of the shower head but other than that, it was clean serviceable esp for the price.
I'll note that you should doublecheck reservations that you make online via the national number and those booked directly as there was a gap in communication for us.",October 2019,Abvi Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29209-d86098-Reviews-Abvi_Athens-Athens_Georgia.html,"Athens, Georgia",hotels,3.0,1.5
Beach Day in Balos and Gramvousa with 4 kids!,"Definitely recommend traveling to the beach here. We are a family of 6 with young kids.

Its pristine, very few people and gorgeous blue. Quite rocky so bring water shoes and your food/ snacks. Best route is to go by boat.",August 2019,Balos Lagoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1028265-d1549927-Reviews-Balos_Lagoon-Kissamos_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Acropolis and Scams,"Several scams are happening along the base of the Acropolis.
2. Make sure you bring water as you hike up. Its an easy hike up though, don't listen or fear the other reviews about the heat.
3. Its cool to see the buildings and look out all over Athens. Once up nothing to see much of the actual buildings though",August 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Best part: ancient city underneath the museum,"1. Took us about 2 hours to go through.
Tons of history, signage could be better as difficult to really understand historical details without a guide
2. Recently opened the site underneath the museum to see historical city..must do
3. They love kids and you can skip the line to the front if you have kids
4. Note: this ticket is separate from the acropolis
5. Take a stop at the cafe for a glass of wine and to chill overlooking the city",August 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
