Charming hotel with fantastic service,"We stayed here for 5 nights and were welcomed very friendly.

Breathtaking history and must see!,"This is definitely a must-see. Try to book an archeologist guise in advance. Makes the event so rewarding. However, there are barricades around the major monuments... and lots of cranes due to restoration. It was still an awesome experience to view the Acropolis up close and from afar. So magical to see the theater and the city of Athens in the background.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fine location,"The hotel is in a fine location about 15 minutes from the Acropolis. It’s on the edge of the tourist area so there are lots of restaurants and stores close by. Rooms are clean, a good size and comfortable, the bathroom modern and clean. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful! The buffet breakfast was great with big variety of products.. The wi-fi was very good.",October 2019,Adrian Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d260810-Reviews-Adrian_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0

Nice dinner,"Went here for dinner third night of our stay in Athens. We had the grilled/fried cheese as an entree and the moussaka which was lovely. Choices not so many but since the quality is good, if someone wants just grilled meat is totally fine! The host was great! And the prices were also nice! We paid 24€, and barely did we finish the plate. Huge portions!",October 2019,To Paradosiako,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7788585-Reviews-To_Paradosiako-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great meal in Athens,"We went here in this restaurant after a week exploring Greece mainland and islands. We chose the seafood in the market, fresh shrimps, clams and octopus.
