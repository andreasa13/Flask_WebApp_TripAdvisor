Cheap is very good,"We went to this place because our ticket was already included.
The place is very cool and there is still a lot of standing that we can see, including a church.
We enjoyed the visit very much and it is worthwhile to see the columns from different style.",September 2020,Hadrian's Library,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d6739897-Reviews-Hadrian_s_Library-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.5

Huge,"The place is huge and you would spend hours looking.

"Little thing standing, but worth it","The temple is huge and has little standing, but it was worth the walk. I really enjoyed seeing the place and seeing everything up close.

Show!,"The temple has undergone a recent renovation and is well maintained and we can see a lot of it. He is small compared to the others around, but I found it beautiful.

Very beautiful,"This point is inside Acropolis, so the same ticket is ok. The place is very beautiful and you can get a sense of what the theater plays were like at that time.

Old Quarter,A place you should spend at least 30 minutes getting to know. The neighborhood looks like those from very old movies and with small houses and straight on the street.

Great,"The place is really nice. You need to spend at least 2 hours there to see everything. A big place with a lot of small temples and things to see.
