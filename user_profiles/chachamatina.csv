Charming hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Siren Hotel. The building is really fascinating. We went up to the top floor and, in the stairwell, you can see the original outer wall with Wurlizter Building still there. That was really cool.
The lobby is incredible in that people actually hang out in it. It’s wonderfully furnished and you can sit and have a coffee and read in a comfortable environment.
The staff is great! Wonderful front desk stag and the staff member who brought us a mini fridge truly was a delight. You could tell she liked working there.
The rooms are tiny which was not a huge deal but the bed was definitely not a queen as advertised. We paid for the 3rd tier up and it was definitely small. The bathroom is gorgeous. The tile work was incredible.
We did not go to the restaurant or bar but we peaked in and the Candy Bar was adorable.
Overall, an excellent experience. Great location.",January 2020,The Siren Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g42139-d13417189-Reviews-The_Siren_Hotel-Detroit_Michigan.html,"Detroit, Michigan",hotels,4.0,4.0
Authentic Santorini Food.,"We visited this restaurant while checking out some of the ancient sites on this side of the island and it was amazing. Some of the best food we had on the island. The santorini special (saganaki with sausage and other fixings), tomato patties (think vegetarian meatballs with tomato), fava spread, salad with capers.... they were all incredible. I highly recommend!!

Very Important Site for Orthodox Christians,"I was so honored to visit this church. It is rich with history and faith. St. Demetrios is entombed here and you are able to visit his tomb. The catacombs are beautiful and well preserved. It's a great way to see how the early Christians worshiped. The church burned at some point during it's history but whenever possible, original parts of the structure are still visible which is super neat.",May 2019,Church of Saint Dimitrios - Patron of Thessaloniki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189473-d243212-Reviews-Church_of_Saint_Dimitrios_Patron_of_Thessaloniki-Thessaloniki_Thessaloniki_Region_.html,"Thessaloniki, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Can't miss it.. literally,You literally cannot miss it since it's standing up in the middle of traffic! We walked under it every day while leaving out AirBnB.

Oldest Book in Europe!,"Great place! Nicely laid out with very cool exhibits. Some highlights for me were the preserved remains of an ancient local woman and the fact that they have literally the oldest book in Europe on display. So cool! There is also an outdoor area to look at statues.

We purchased entrance to this museum in a bundle with others and it was a great value.

Delicious!,"My cousin brought me here for dinner when I was in Greece four years ago. When I came back with my husband, I had to come back! I love this place. It's absolutely delicious and it's in the center of everything so great people watching! Musicians even came by while we were having our lunch.

Fun Spot to See in Athens,"This is more of a bazaar than flea market although there is a section with antiques/used items. It's has some really cool authentic shops and lots of basic souvenir shops. It's not necessarily where you find the stuff you want to get for the best price, but you will definitely find stuff there!
Monastiraki is very easy to find as it has it's own stop on the train. Mind your belongings here! You can easily be pick-pocketed. It is very congested. When you get off the train, there is a central area with a church and lots of people lounging and hanging out. From there, there are little off-shoots with shops and restaurants.
Definitely a place to go when you are in Athens!",October 2018,Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d265865-Reviews-Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Lovely,"Our guide dropped us at a point above the monastary so we were able to walk down towards it and then he picked us up below it so it was all downhill unlike the others we visited however I still recommend good walking shoes!

Must see!,"This is the largest of the monasteries in the region and it is amazing. Incredible history, amazing views and just a beautiful, humbling experience. Men must wear long pants and ladies must wear skirts but no worries, they can give you a quick little sarong thing to pop on. I wore a skirt but I would recommend just taking advantage of the sarong since the whole region is a lot of climbing steps so you will want to be comfortable. There is a delightful (and reasonably priced) gift shop there too. Very cool place.

Symbol of the City,"I love the White Tower. It stands proudly along the harbor and has a great museum inside. The museum was largely created with locals in mind so much of the signage is in Greek.

At the top, you get an incredible panoramic view of the city from the water to the mountains.

It's fine for the cost,"Air Transat was a perfectly fine experience for my husband and me. We chose to fly out of Toronto instead of Detroit due to the significant savings. This airline is definitely a good deal. My husband is tall so I paid the extra amount for more leg room and I am glad I did. I would have been fine, but he would have been miserable.
The flight was no problem, departed and arrived on time. Food was good- no complaints. There were little personal TV's which were nice.

Must-See,"I love this museum. It's absolutely beautiful. The floor is glass in many areas so you can see the work they are doing underground to excavate and preserve an ancient town.

The View!,"I’ll start off by saying the view here is amazing!!! The hotel is reasonably priced unlike many of the surrounding lodgings. We came in October and though still warm enough to swim, we didn’t really care if we had a pool.
The room is neat and tidy and nicely furnished. The bed was very comfortable and the room had a little kitchenette which was great. Just a heads up- there are a lot of steps to go down to the hotel but you get used to it. Santorini is steps everywhere!
The veranda is lovely and they have chairs and tables set up at each one. They are separated only by a little wall but that’s really fine as most of the places in Santorini are similar. Plus we made great friends with our neighbors!
It is an easy walk to the nearby town of Fira although getting to Oia would be more of a hike than a walk so we took the bus there.
The staff is incredible! Super accommodating and they helped us get to airport and let us leave our luggage with them after check out. The gentleman who drove us to the airport even met us in Oia with our luggage and only charged us a small fee. So much easier than buses and cabs with luggage.
I HIGHLY recommended!!",October 2018,Annio Furnished Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d620133-Reviews-Annio_Furnished_Apartments-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Basic but pleasantly surprised!,Stayed here for one night. I’m very anxious when it comes to lodgings. The front desk lady was so kind. She even let me see a room before I committed. The room was clean and the bathroom looked recently renovated. Bed was comfortable and clean. Breakfast was modest but it was there! Coffee was good!

Pleasant Surprise,"While driving home from somewhere kind of near there (I’m from the Detroit-area and have no idea where we were) we stopped here for gas because it was the only place around.

Ups and Downs,"The beds were comfortable and mattresses looked new. That was good.

There was a stick of deodorant left behind in the drawer in the bedside table and a used coffee filter in the coffee machine. The room was not closely serviced.

The bathroom light switches did not have a cover on them. Also, the bathroom sink’s drain cover wouldn’t pop up so I had to pull it out completely.

We called the front desk repeatedly in the morning for 40 minutes and no one answered. When we checked out, no one was there. On the counter there say several room keys with notes from other people who were trying to check out. We did the same.

They did call per my friends request and I think they comped one of our rooms due to the issues we experienced so that was nice.",June 2018,Wyndham Garden Pittsburgh Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2630790-d226204-Reviews-Wyndham_Garden_Pittsburgh_Airport-Findlay_Township_Pennsylvania.html,"Findlay Township, Pennsylvania",hotels,3.0,3.0
"Nice hotel, rooftop bar was a nice touch.","This is a modern, clean hotel. The view from our room was lovely. Also, there is a roof top bar which gives a great view as well.

Definitely Worth the Price,"Yes, it's pricey. I almost didn't go. However, buy your tickets a week in advance plus sometimes they have coupons. If you buy them the day of it's $65, $60 1-7 days before and $55 7+ days before. The tickets include the house, the gardens/grounds and a complimentary wine tasting. Parking is ample and it's a little bit of a walk to the house. I believe there is shuttle service to and from the parking lot but ONLY to and from the parking lot, I'll go into that later.
The house is spectacular. The view is amazing. You really do get to see a lot of the house, 4 floors including the basement. Plus it is super interesting. For an extra charge, you can do a self guided audio tour but I just used the book they gave me and it was really helpful. The carriage house area has been made into a cafe and gift shops which is really neat!
The gardens are fantastic. We were there a long time and we needed to get to the winery before it closed so we only saw the Italian Garden which was beautiful. On your way out, you actually drive through a bit so we got to see the greenhouse then which was cool. Plus there is separate parking there with another little greenhouse gift shop.
The winery is on the estate but it's a solid 2 miles away so you hop in your car and head over there. Very lovely area located by the hotels and more little shops. The wine tasting was nice and good for a novice however it was very busy and there was like 1 wine tasting person for every 3 sets of 2 people so we didn't taste much wine. I will say those little crackers for cleansing your palate are delicious.

Now the rationale for 4 stars instead of 5.
We did want to try the restaurant and it was my birthday. Unfortunately, in order to eat there you need to have paid the admission for a ticket to come in that same day (or be staying at the hotels). We weren't going until the next day so they offered me a discounted ticket. Why would I pay for a ticket to enter a restaurant where I am paying for food?
Also, in order to use the shuttle service, you have to be staying in a hotel on the estate. I was rudely informed of this by a driver. When I asked about the shuttle to the winery, I was curtly told ""no, you can get in your own car and drive there."" Obviously I didn't mind however his attitude really bummed me out.",September 2017,Biltmore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60742-d102846-Reviews-Biltmore-Asheville_North_Carolina.html,"Asheville, North Carolina",attractions,4.0,4.5

Fun!,"Came here while visiting family in Tennessee. Very cool. The cave tour is mostly pretty easy walking with the exception of one steep hill leading back up and out of the lake area. Oh, and sometimes it's really slippery. If you are tall, you will be warned to watch your head often. I didn't have that problem. Lots of great history and the tour guides are so fun! We laughed so much with our guide which is made it such an enjoyable experience. He was knowledgeable and clearly enjoyed his job. We went on the boat ride through the underground lake. It says glass bottom which it is but only kind of. It's a long narrow panel of glass but it's fine, that really doesn't effect it much. You can see the fish and everything just fine.

I didn't realize until we got there where I was exactly. The gravity of the place. This is where they made a serious component of the atomic bombs. Yow! Crazy.

Monticello House and Property,"Very cool- must see. It is very busy there so make sure you buy your ticket in advance! The house tour is exceptional. They also offer two other tours included in your admission- gardens tour and slavery tour. The house tour is a small group based on a time slot. The other tour tours are very casual.
Unfortunately, it was so busy when we went that we had to leave the garden tour early to make the house tour time. We also left the slavery tour early because we were exhausted, couldn't really hear the tour guide and the group was just huge. Those 2 supplementary are kind of drop in tours. They were huge, lots of people. We couldn't always hear the tour guides (and the tours are more listening than seeing) and it was just too many people. That's the only negative thing I have to say.
Our slavery tour guide was great. He reflected very well on the dark history of slavery in the US, I wish I could have stayed longer. Same with the garden tour guide who was very excited to talk about TJ and his amateur botany experiments.
The house tour guide was wonderful. She clearly loved her job and was animated and fun.

Incredible.,"If there is anything to see once in your life, it is the Badlands. It's stunning and so much fun. Visitors can really roam around and you can do anything from standing on an observation deck, getting close to the edge all the way to hiking through trails. There are nice walkways built up to aid in walking around and also protecting visitors from wildlife that may be hanging out in some areas. There are little displays where you can see fossil exhibits and learn other valuable information. Look for buffalo and other animals grazing along your path.

Mount Rushmore,I enjoyed visiting Mount Rushmore. We went at night first which is very cool to see and I highly recommend it. We came back the next morning and walked along the paths all along the front of the monuments which was very cool. I also noted some hiking trails in the area. The gallery area is lovely and accessible. Parking is ample. The monument is free but parking is $10 however parking is good for the year if you come back. Lots of cool history and information!,October 2016,Mount Rushmore National Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60908-d143767-Reviews-Mount_Rushmore_National_Memorial-Keystone_South_Dakota.html,"Keystone, South Dakota",attractions,4.0,4.5
Amazing.,"Crazy Horse Memorial is incredible. Note that it is not a national monument so there is a cost to get in. I believe it is $11 per person. It is worth every penny. As you can see, it is not completed because a single family has been dedicated their time to the memorial for half a century. I was moved by this whole place. There is a beautiful museum with live and stationary exhibits. There is an observation deck where you can see the large sculpture of the intended memorial. Just stunning. You can also take a bus tour to the base of the memorial.",October 2016,Crazy Horse Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g54568-d144991-Reviews-Crazy_Horse_Memorial-Crazy_Horse_South_Dakota.html,"Crazy Horse, South Dakota",attractions,5.0,4.0
Delicious!,"Totally stumbled on this place by accident. We decided to take a different route up from Custer (rather than taking the freeway to the east, we took the road going up through the gulch). We landed in Hill City hungry and decided on the Hill City cafe. It was delicious! Friendly staff and a great menu. I had a nice breakfast and my husband had their special of the day which was steak and shrimp (early lunch/late breakfast). He was able to get the soup and salad bar which was small but well stocked and very fresh. Also, at each table they had these little books that had the history of the area with excerpts from newspapers and other documents.

A Fantastic Learning Experience,"Great place for the science buff and non-science buff alike! The building is built over the site so everything you see inside is 100% real and in the earth! You can walk all around on the walk ways looking over the site and see actual bones and see where the team works. There is a small museum area which is very cool as well as a laboratory in the basement. Although you can't go in, you can see in to where the technicians are working. The lab was also dedicated to veterans of the Afghan and Iraq wars which I though was great. The tour was fun and the gift shop is fun and quirky.",October 2016,Mammoth Site of Hot Springs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60995-d144846-Reviews-Mammoth_Site_of_Hot_Springs-Hot_Springs_South_Dakota.html,"Hot Springs, South Dakota",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wow!,"This lodge is actually two parts, one side is cabins and the other is more like a motel. The grounds are lovely and well-kept. We stayed in a cabin with a kitchenette and a deck that faced Calamity Peak. It was so cool! There were just two of us so we didn't need two beds and a pull out couch but it was great none the less.
My ONLY complaint was that the bed wasn't so comfortable but it wasn't enough to drop down the star rating. The owners are wonderful and so helpful. I broke a dish and felt terrible and they were totally cool about it and thanked me for telling them. The price was GREAT! We came during the off-season but I was still shocked and how cheap it was! Custer state park is a mile up the road and you are never far from Mt. Rushmore of any of the area sites.
As far as cleanliness is concerned, we stayed at a lot of hotels on our trip and this little place had the cleanest bathroom I had seen the whole time.

Not to be Missed!,"Loved it! We saw buffalo, coyotes and so many more animals! Of course, the prairie dogs were adorable, funny and abundant. There is so much to see and do!

Mesmerizing.,"Sylvan Lake simply mesmerized me. You can walk all around the lake and watch the group sparkle with quartz. There is some hiking to be done as well. The water was so blue and serene that the rocks had perfect reflections. We didn't plan on stopping here, but while driving the Needles Highway, we saw it and had to stop and walk around.

So cool!,I really enjoyed this part of our trip.You go pretty far underground and see some amazing rock formations an quartz and learn a lot about the natural history of the area.

It's just fun!,"We stopped here while visiting the black hills and badlands area of South Dakota. After seeing bumper stickers and having no idea what it is, I get it now. It's just fun! It's a tourist trap but it actually has a really interesting history! Lots of shops and a cafe along with an outdoor mall type area. In the back there is the ""backyard"" where you can see the Jackalope and the T-Rex along with other neat kitschy stuff.

Lots of Info in a Great Little Museum,"This museum is really fun. There are lots of exhibits and we learned a lot of great information about Deadwood. The exhibit items are numbered and you kind of have to hunt to find the actual items but overall it was a fantastic experience.

"It's can be a bit of a trek, but well worth it.","Mount Moriah Cemetery is located high in the hills and the views are breathtaking. It was very cool to see Wild Bill and Calamity Jane's resting places along with Reverend Smith and Dora DuFran. As you will read in other reviews, Seth Bullock is buried much high up the hill from the main cemetery area. We would later learn that this is because Seth wanted to be buried overlooking the memorial he built to Teddy Roosevelt (See Friendship Tower). Yes, it's a bit of a hike up there, especially if you are not prepared so make sure you have some water and good shoes. It's not terrible, but be prepared for it not to be a gentle stroll.

"History, Friendship and a Great View","After a scenic drive, you will reach a small clearing with space for parking, an outhouse and a picnic area. From there, the short but uphill trail leads you to the tower. On the way, there is a placard that has the names of all the peaks you see while on the trail which I really liked. The tower is very lovely with a fabulous view. You are able to go up to the top via the spiral staircase for an even better view. Also, there are signs providing information and history. Come prepared, although it isn't a difficult hike, wear good shoes and grab a bottle of water.

"Lovely, Historic Hotel","We stayed one night in Bullock Hotel on a trip to Deadwood. The hotel is lovely, but please keep in mind the building is very old. The heat made a weird sound which kept me up at night and the bed was kind of lumpy. Also, the floor could use a bit of a vacuum.
The room was fine and we had two large windows overlooking Main Street. The bathroom was clean.
So, why did it give it 5 stars? Well, for one, these are issues with old buildings. Not much you can do. Next, the people who work there are among the kindest, most genuine people I have ever met. I called the hotel literally in tears due to some travel problems resulting in me being in Deadwood and my husband being in Minneapolis and they were so kind to me and helped me out and made me feel much better. The next morning, everyone knew us and were saying ""oh! he made it!"" Everyone knew me there!

The ghost tour was really fun and informative. Note that during the off season, it's only on the weekends and it's at 5pm, not 5:30.

Like most of the hotels, there is a casino on the first floor. They offer you free drinks while you are playing.

There is also a company called Oh Fudge! that sells fudge on the first floor and it's delicious.

Well worth the stay even if it's just for one night to get the old time Deadwood feel.",October 2016,Bullock Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g54578-d246954-Reviews-Bullock_Hotel-Deadwood_South_Dakota.html,"Deadwood, South Dakota",hotels,5.0,4.0
Incredible,We came during the off season and a little late in the day. The visitor's center was not open but we got to see it all during sunset which was very cool.

Fine,"This hotel was fine. We were in town for a funeral and needed a place to stay. It was clean enough and did the trick. The TV in our room was an old tube TV but the TV in my in-laws' room was a flat screen. Not a big deal, I just thought it was funny. The blanket situation was a little weak. I never use the top blanket in any hotel because usually there is another but it was just a thin little thing so I was kind of cold. You can tell they are remodeling or at least recently remodeled but again that's not a bid issue at all.
