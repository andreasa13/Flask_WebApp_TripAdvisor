One Needs to be Careful and must bargain Hard,"Prices are higher, so one needs to be careful. No point in buying Silver jewelry from road side shops. Sometimes they don't show much interest for indian buyers, as Indians do hard bargain. Comparatively they prefer Europeans, whom they can fool easily. A Lion faced lock, which was priced at Rs.1500 was finally given to me at Rs.750. Quoting prices with such high margin is not a good biz practice.

"My Fav place in Goa, but need improvement","I have stayed in this place 5 times in last 10 years. Biggest plus is Location, right on Calangute - Baga road.
But I will suggest few improvements, if they really care for their guests.
1. No complimentary water. Water was made available at 50% higher price, which is illegal ans someone can take them to court.
2. Breakfast need better spread.
3. They can maintain own fleet of taxis for Airport drop and pick up, though Taxis were easily available just outside the hotel.

"Finally I made it to the ""Sonar Kella"", A dream came true.","I had seen Satyajit Ray's Sonar Kella (the Golden Fort) for the 1st time in 1980. But finally i got a chance to visit this place on 27 Oct 2019. A great feeling, and I was not disappointed at all (as opined by some reviewer). The Fort is the only live fort in India where 5000 people still live, so please don't complaint about it being too crowded. Excellent structure, made of Yellow lime stone, which brought a Golden touch to this city. A good place to buy some souvenir, and of course a stone bowl or pathor bati.
But sorry, I did not buy the golden bowl, but bought something else. In a museum inside the fort, i learned about Red Limestone from Habur village which is situated about 50 Kms from the city. Apparently a bowl or glass made from such stone has the property to convert milk in to card without any fermentation. These stones were formed about 180 Million years ago, and has two varieties, - Wood fossil and sea fossil. sea fossil is more expensive and a glass costed me a little over 50 dollar. It also has other medical values of curing high BP, Sugar etc. I am now in the process of doing the Experiment.
A must see fort for any history lovers.",October 2019,Jaisalmer Fort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297667-d324658-Reviews-Jaisalmer_Fort-Jaisalmer_Jaisalmer_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jaisalmer, India",attractions,5.0,4.5
"For an authentic Jodhpur , stay here","I stayed here for a night and really enjoyed it. The fort is just 15 mins walk thru narrow bulane.
Connecting lanes are very narrow and extremely dirty, that too during Diwali. It's a shame for the Municipality. Can't blame the hotel. The place is inhabited by Brahmins, so you will not get Onion Kachouri, in the nearby sweet shops. This was explained by a local shop keeper. Autos on road are too noisy, all old models and highly polluting.
Food in the hotel was good. Makes sense to stay here.",October 2019,Singhvi's Haveli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297668-d866477-Reviews-Singhvi_s_Haveli-Jodhpur_Jodhpur_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jodhpur, India",hotels,4.0,4.5
