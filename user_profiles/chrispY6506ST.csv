Food was nice. Service was appalling. Please be aware,"Having perused a number of restaurants nearby we settled on this nice little restaurant with a varied menu to cater for all in our party. The evening started well with a friendly waiter and a swift service of our pre-dinner drinks.

Our waiter then took our order for starters and mains without any initial problems. One of the less ravenous of our group chose to decline entrees as the waiter had promised their meals came with both potatoes and vegetables and the other decided on a mushroom risotto. The risotto came out quickly as did my friends fish (main course) and bruschetta.

We then had to wait ten minutes for another starter. I on the other hand was left without my starter for 30 minutes, in the meantime two of my friends had finished albeit without their promised vegetables and only received the stated potatoes upon request. My other friend was patiently awaiting his main course and once it arrived again had no potatoes or vegetables. I still had nothing and it was only at this point that the waiter checked with me on what I had ordered and it soon became clear that they had forgotten mine completely. We were repeatedly told the food would be here shortly and were repeatedly let down.

After another 20 minutes (and being the only one left to eat) my starter arrived followed swiftly by my main course. While all this was going on we had consumed a good three bottles of wine. Upon arrival of the bill we complained to both the waiter and what we assume to be the manager for the delay and the lack of acknowledgment for their mistake. At first they seemed considerate to our protestations, that is until we kindly asked for one of the three bottles of wine (drank only because the wait was so long) to be taken off the bill as a token of good will. At this point the manager became aggressive and refused our request. After some deliberation he disappeared and returned with what looked like a 4 Euro bottle of wine and said we can have this instead. An offer which we immediately refused, the tone of the manager then became even more spikey and three heavily set gentlemen then appeared around our table as if they thought we would start destroying the restaurant. I realise the Brit’s have a certain reputation abroad, but let’s be clear this is not Benidorm, this is a quaint little fishing village on the northern coast of Sicily.

At no point did we raise our voices or were rude towards the staff, therefore we can only assume this was an act of intimidation. More deliberation then followed and it soon became apparent that the manager was holding firm against our protests. In order to keep the peace and as not to discomfort our fellow diners and given that the food, albeit absent for most part of the evening, was very nice, we decided it was best to pay the bill and be on our way. As we left we asked the manager if he was on trip advisor and if so we would leave a suitably accurate review of our evening in his restaurant. To which he replied ‘congratulations, go ahead and leave your review’ while smiling sarcastically, so here it is Mr Manager Sir in all its glitz and glory.

I would also like to offer my congratulations, firstly to anyone who has stuck with me this far in reading the whole of this review and also to the owner of the restaurant (if he takes time to read such things) in a restaurant that prides itself on good food, laughable service and aggressive intimidation to ensure their customers have a truly memorable evening. To be clear we travel a lot, to a large variety of countries. We are also polite and courteous. This was easily the worst service and intimidation we have ever received.",September 2015,Ristorante Al Burgo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608929-d1888776-Reviews-Ristorante_Al_Burgo-Castellammare_del_Golfo_Province_of_Trapani_Sicily.html,"Sicily, Italy",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Really nice hotel,"Stayed here to two nights in June and had a really nice stay.

Arrived around 11.30pm, check in was really quick.

We had a room on the sixth floor. Room was clean and tidy with two single beds pushed together. Big windows and decent blinds meant lots of fresh air and decent darkness.

Bathroom was nice, although we had a bath with shower but no shower curtain so floor got quite wet.

Bar area was always open and although service was a little slow it was friendly.

We only made it to breakfast one morning and this was right at the end so there wasn't much left. A friend was first into breakfast one morning on his way back from a night out and said it was excellent then. Bread, cereal, meats & juices etc

Location wise was fine, probably around 10-15 min walk from Old Town.

Front desk were helpful at all time, giving directions to bars etc and booking taxis for us.

Overall a nice hotel for a weekend break",June 2008,Hanza Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274967-d652760-Reviews-Hanza_Hotel-Riga_Riga_Region.html,"Riga, Latvia",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Lovely place, great location","We stayed here for two nights during the Carnival season

Room rates were excellent and upon arrival we were upgraded to the apartment for no extra charge.

Room is dated and a little tatty in places but is very clean and comfy.

We flew into Marco Polo then got the land bus and then walked from the drop off. It is an easy walk and a good excuse to stop for some drink. San Marco square is signposted the whole way and the hotel is only 5 mins from here. Great location.

Breakfast is good, with cereals, rolls, cakes, yoghurt, tea, coffee etc.

Staff are excellent. Some of the friendlest I have met.

All in all I would highly recommend a stay here",January 2008,Hotel Mercurio Venezia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187870-d283771-Reviews-Hotel_Mercurio_Venezia-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.0
A few problems,"We stayed here for 3 nights in Sept.

Requested a non smoking room when I booked, when I arrived we were told we had to have a smoking room. I insisted on non smoking and was given this but only for 2 nights and we had to check out after the 2nd night and see what was available.

First two nights were fine and we found the room comfortable and clean.

Pool was nice as was breakfast although did get crowded and difficult to find a seat.

On returning to the hotel for the 3rd night we were told only smoking rooms left. I checked the room out and it stank. They cleaned it again which made a little bit of difference but I was not impressed with this.

Spoke to the front desk when I checked out but he wasn't very helpful.

Location wise it is a little out of town but not too bad.

If I were to stay here again I would contact the hotel directly and get assurances that you will have the room you booked.",September 2007,Quality Inn Moab Slickrock Area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60724-d109940-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Moab_Slickrock_Area-Moab_Utah.html,"Moab, Utah",hotels,2.0,3.5
Really enjoyable,"We really enjoyed our stay here.

We stayed for 5 nights. Asked for a room on a high floor with a view of the strip and that is what we got.

Check in was simple and also got a fridge for $15 for whole stay.

Room was large and clean with two queen size beds and large bathroom. Asked for extra pillows and these turned up within 10 mins.

Casino - not too crowded and I didn't find that smokey
Exercise room - up to date equipment
Spa - Looked lovely
Cinema - Excellent so nice to be able to wander back from film to room
Security - Always asked to show key in evening before getting lift which was good
Food - Had the breakfast buffet most mornings, it did get busy around 9 but they seated people quickly, loads of choice - almost too much.
Eat at Mexican one night as well that was one of the nicest meals of the holiday
Bowling Alley - Looked good, didn't use it
Bars - Quite busy, barman not that attentive to customers
Shuttle bus - Only used once but excellent way of getting to the strip

The only real complaints I would have about this hotel were:

1) Noticed being charged $15 night for fridge, phoned and queried, she said would sort but didn't so had to go to desk and sort. $15/ngt is correct but after being told $15 for whole stay I insisted on this and they agreed
2) The location of the pool - At no stage during the day does the whole of the pool get the sun. There is plenty of space to sun bathe but pool itself is in shade for most of day

Location wise about 1.5miles to the strip. Walked it one night but along a busy road so not that nice a walk.

For the money I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to others. It is away from the busy strip which I think is a nice thing.",September 2007,The Orleans Hotel & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d91907-Reviews-The_Orleans_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,4.0,4.0
Suitable for short stay,"I have been to Slovakia 3 times and each time have stayed for a night at the hotel.

The hotel is basic but clean. Our main reason for visiting is exploring the area and the beer to be honest so we are just after a basic place to sleep.

There are lots of other services offered such as gym, squash, tennis etc but we have never used these.

We also have not had the breakfast so can't comment on that.

Rooms have balconies giving nice view over Poprad.

Location wise it is between the train station and the town so that is good.

Cost - It cost us £45 for a night sleeping 3 in a room. I don't really know how that compares with others so can't comment.

All in all a hotel that does the job but does look dated",October 2007,Hotel Satel Poprad,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274938-d507145-Reviews-Hotel_Satel_Poprad-Poprad_Presov_Region.html,"Poprad, Slovakia",hotels,3.0,3.0
Enjoyable stay close to park,"We booked a 3 night stay here and really enjoyed it.

After reading the reviews we requested a room in the new block. We were very happy with this room, it was clean and tidy. We had two queen size beds.

We used the pool once and after I managed to get my room key to work in the gate.

The breakfast room is too small for the number of people here however we didn't expect breakfast so can't complain. The best bet is too take your food back to your room.

The hotel is a mile or so away from the South Entrance.

Food wise we ate at the Quality Inn next door, they do a lovely buffet.

All in all I thought this hotel was very nice.",September 2007,Red Feather Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g31393-d567125-Reviews-Red_Feather_Lodge-Tusayan_Arizona.html,"Tusayan, Arizona",hotels,4.0,3.5
"Very basic, could do better","We stayed here for two nights and were not that impressed.

To call it a resort is a little bit of a stretch.

We were in one of the cabins and the main thing was the bed was comfy and the room clean however the decor was run down and you could tell not much had been done to the place for awhile.

The bathroom was very basic with a shower curtain that would not pull across easily.

We ate breakfast once in the restaurant however had to send the oatmeal back as it was cold.

If you are after a basic, clean place then this will do the trick. We weren't here for long as spent most the time in the park so it was ok for us. It was less expensive than Ruby's and easier to book as Ruby's books up well in advance.

There isn't loads of choice in the area and it is very close to the park.

I'm giving it a 2 as it was clean but for the money then I think they could improve it. I don't think them calling it a resort really does them many favours.",September 2007,Bryce Canyon Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g56943-d110302-Reviews-Bryce_Canyon_Resort-Bryce_Utah.html,"Bryce, Utah",hotels,2.0,2.5
Really good value place,"We stayed here for one night in Sept. This was just a stop off to break up the journey after flying into Vegas before getting to Bryce.

The hotel was easy to find, clean and comfortable.

The guy on the front desk was very welcoming.

Breakfast was basic but did the trick.

I would give it 5 however error made on bill. Although this was sorted out after a phone call once I noticed.",September 2007,Best Western Mesquite Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45973-d444580-Reviews-Best_Western_Mesquite_Inn-Mesquite_Nevada.html,"Mesquite, Nevada",hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent Hotel,"We found this hotel excellent.

The location is just five mins from the main square, and about 10 from the train station.

The hotel from the outside looks a bit run down but once inside there is no sign of this.

The rooms are quite small but use the space well. We had booked 7 twin rooms. The beds actually face each other in a line which is odd.

We arrived before the allotted check in time but they gave us the keys without any problems.

The rooms were very clean and the shower was powerful.

The breakfast has plenty of things too choose from, and even had English breakfast tea. A few of the trays were a little limited when we got down quite late but were hungover so didn't mind too much. The breakfast is also served until 11 which is good.

On returning to the room after breakfast one day we noticed that the room had already been serviced. They were very efficient.

People at the front desk were helpful and we found the hotel quite quiet.

All in all an excellent hotel.",April 2007,Hotel Wyspianski,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274772-d276988-Reviews-Hotel_Wyspianski-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",hotels,5.0,4.0
Lovely hotel near the beach,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights in a room advertised as 'garden view'. The garden view is in actual fact a view of a hedge and beyond this is the car park so we did feel a little cheated regarding this. I have since emailed them about this and they replied promptly apologising and have changed the description of this room.

The room itself was lovely. We had two queen sized beds and a very clean room. There were also some nice shampoo's etc.

The pool and spa are really nice and you also get a robe which came in handy when using the pool.

I really enjoyed the breakfast, especially making my own waffles. The range of food at breakfast was the best of all the hotels we stayed at. They also have complimentary cookies in reception.

During our stay we visited Hearst castle and I would recommend this to anyone staying in Cambria. It is only 5 miles away.

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. When we checked in they gave us a map of the town which was very handy.

The beach is just over the road and there is some nice decking before the beach which helps with a nice walk. Viewing the sunset from one of the benches was lovely.

In summary I would happily stay here again and would recommend it to others.",September 2006,Fireside Inn on Moonstone Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32148-d76301-Reviews-Fireside_Inn_on_Moonstone_Beach-Cambria_San_Luis_Obispo_County_California.html,"Cambria, California",hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent value for money,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights in September and it was excellent.

As we were in a city centre I asked for a room on a high floor in a quiet area. When we checked in we were given room 711. This is on the top floor (I think) and right at the back. The room was really quiet and just what we wanted.

We flew into town and got the BART train into the city. This was really easy and cheap $5.15 each and the hotel is only about a 5-10 walk from the train stop.

If you do this I would however recommend you walk up Powell and along Geary st as opposed to taking a direct route from the train station to the hotel like we did. Unfortunately this takes you through the homeless area which wasn't too pretty.

The hotel itself is clean, the room was big enough for us with an excellent bathroom. The shower was low but this seems to be the done thing in America as every hotel we stayed in had a low shower.

The reception staff were helpful and gave us a handy map of the city which was excellent. They also marked out any areas to avoid.

The breakfast is basic with Coffee, Juice, Toast and Cakes but this was more than enough to enable you to get out sightseeing quickly.

The location was good, really close to the shops. The walk to the Pier, Alcatraz takes about 40 mins and involves a few hills, so if this is your main focus you might want to stay a little closer or get a tram.

The only downside was the window in our room didn't lock, however when we looked at the drop out from it we realised no one would try it.

In summary an excellent hotel and I would recommend to anyone going to San Francisco who doesn't want to spend all their money on hotels",September 2006,Adante Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d80756-Reviews-Adante_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",hotels,4.0,3.0
Top Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for five nights in September and really enjoyed it.

The hotel is easy to find, just off highway 8 interstate 163. On hotel circle which is signposted on the highway.

The reception staff are very helpful. They were excellent when we checked in and gave us some discount vouchers for the Waffle Spot & Amigo. He also gave us a voucher for Macy's giving us 11% off for the five days we were there. We asked for directions a few times while there and each time they gave us a little card with exact directions from the hotel to the place. This was excellent and a really good touch.

The room. Pros: Basic but clean. Comfy bed. Thick curtains, quiet, good size, air con. Cons: TV reception wasn't the best. Air con a little noisy. The bathroom door didn't shut properly

The pool was large and during the day was really quiet. It did get a little noisy in evening, and is open until 10 so you might want to ask for a room away from it.

The Waffle spot had basic food, however service is very slow.

They have internet pc's that you need to pay for by the minute .25c for 5 mins.

About a few min drive away there are two great shopping malls, Fashion Valley & Mission Valley. These have different styles of shops. The former having the more expensive ones but were both excellent. There is a cinema at the latter one. We went to these malls most evenings as open until 9pm.

Seaword & the Zoo are easy to get to as is downtown San Diego although we found parking downtown was difficult.

Overall for the money this hotel was brilliant and I would recommend it to anyone who is comfortable with basic hotels.",September 2006,Kings Inn San Diego,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d80223-Reviews-Kings_Inn_San_Diego-San_Diego_California.html,"San Diego, California",hotels,4.0,4.5
Loved it,"We stayed here for two nights in September and wished we stayed for longer.

I paid extra for a river view room. Other posters mention different building names but I am unsure what ours was. It was the furthest block up the hill!!

Our room had two queen sized beds, air con, fan, fridge, basic kitchen, large bathroom, fireplace and the best aspect was the patio which had a great view of the river. (Although they could have cut the trees back a little).

The reception staff were ok when we checked in and I never had cause to return until we checked out.

During the day we would go up to the park and take in the views. One walk well worth doing is the one up to Glacier point it is 4.8 miles one way. It was really hard work but the views from the top made the hard work worth it.

One of the other works we did was inspiration trial which is a 2.6mile round trip and at the top we saw three mountain lions which was scarey.

The hotel has a few pools and spas and it was great to sit in the spa in the evening looking up at the sky. It was so relaxing.

Food wise at the hotel we went basic and had pizza. It was however one of the nicest pizza's I have had. For breakfast we just had cereal and sat out on our patio.

We normally go for cheaper hotels however I am glad we paid the extra and stayed at this hotel.

When we return to Yosemite we will stay at this place again",September 2006,Yosemite Valley Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g61000-d119523-Reviews-Yosemite_Valley_Lodge-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html,"Yosemite National Park, California",hotels,5.0,4.0
Not that bad at all,"We stayed at this hotel for one night on the 15th September.

After booking a room for the night which included 21 days parking for £77 I checked the reviews.

They were not very favourable to say the least. I therefore decided to email the hotel and advise them I had seen the reviews and did not expect to have any of the problems other people mention.

I had to phone on two occasions in order to get a reply to this email and they advised that they noted my comments against my booking.

Upon arrival I found the check in desk staff to be very helpful I was seen straight away and they were very polite. We were given a room on the first floor.

Parking however was a problem, they have nowhere near enough parking and it does seem to be a case of you just dump your car wherever you can find a space and hope for the best.

The room itself was basic but clean. The window didn't open though which I never like. The small air con unit served a purpose although it was noisy.

There isn't any lift.

I would stay here again due to the ease of getting to the airport. It is only a mile or two away and taxi costs £9. I also think the cost is fair based on the service you recieve.

In summary I don't think this hotel is as bad as others have suggested. It might be worth emailing them like I did as it least it might make them ensure your stay goes smoothly.",September 2006,Thistle London Heathrow Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g191261-d253629-Reviews-Thistle_London_Heathrow_Hotel-West_Drayton_Greater_London_England.html,"West Drayton, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,3.5
It was alright,"I had high hopes for this hotel after reading the reviews. Unfortunately these were not all met.

The best thing about the hotel is the location. You are only two blocks from the beach and about a 30 min walk away for a large shopping area.

The main problems I had with the hotel was the bed. I have never slept on a noisier bed in my life. It was really hard to get a good nights sleep as when one of you turned over you woke the other one. When I advised the guy on check out they simply explained the bed frame needed tightening but made no apology.

As well as that they have blinds instead of curtains so the room never really gets that dark, and if you are on the groundfloor you feel that someone could quite easily see in even if they are shut.

The last problem we had was the noise. I am fine with traffic noise. However they have tiled floors and the person above us seemed to spend at least two hours each night walking around and by the sounds of it in 6in heels.

The room itself was very clean, the bathroom was nice and I have no complaints about that.

The location and the price are the biggest plus points.

All I would say is avoid room number 1 and if you can choose then ask for a room on the 1st floor not the ground floor",September 2006,Sea Shore Motel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33052-d119450-Reviews-Sea_Shore_Motel-Santa_Monica_California.html,"Santa Monica, California",hotels,2.0,4.0
Very nice hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights in March and would recommend this hotel to others.

As the per the previous review we found the hotel very easy to find. We got the Jasper coach from the airport, which drops you at the main station. We then got a tube on line U3 to St Pauli station. It is just round the corner.

In our first night we stayed in room 201, the room itself was lovely, however it was facing the road and due to the single glazing we found it very noisy. If you have trouble sleeping with traffic noise, I would suggest avoiding the rooms at the front 101-104, 201-204 etc. Also the hotel has only very thin curtains.

The reception staff were very helpful when we asked to move rooms in the morning and arranged for room 314 to be cleaned while we had breakfast.

The hotel is very clean and nicely decorated. The bar has a very nice atmosphere and the breakfast is well stocked with hot & cold food. Only drawback is no English tea!

Across the road from the hotel is a lovely park with an outdoor ice rink.

All in all this hotel was very nice",March 2006,Novum Hotel Holstenwall Hamburg Neustadt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187331-d201168-Reviews-Novum_Hotel_Holstenwall_Hamburg_Neustadt-Hamburg.html,"Hamburg, Germany",hotels,4.0,3.5
Average,"This hotel was ok but nothing to write home about.

We booked this hotel as a one night stay to save driving to Gatwick on the day. It served its purpose but not much more. For £80 via a flight reservations it seemed ok value compared to other places and considering how much hotels in this country cost.

If you are using it for hotel parking, upon checking in you are advised to move your car to a different area of the car park and then leave your keys at reception.

The room we had, and also the other people who arrived at the same time was miles away from reception and is along corridor after corridor, it is also up various stairs which with no lift and suitcases is hard work.

We booked the coach to the airport as well and this is well priced at £2.50 return, what we didn't know was the Felbridge is the first of 3 hotels that the coach picks up from, it therefore takes ages to get to Gatwick (goes to South then North terminal) and the coach we were on was packed. The cases come on with you so it isn't the most comfortable of rides. The only good thing with being the first pick up was we ensured we got a place as people at the last hotel had to wait for the next one.

On our return you had to go to the coach pick up point, ours was number 11. We were going to get a taxi as couldn't be bothered waiting however the fare quoted was £18.50. The coach back didn't take too long (50mins), although you are the last of the three to drop off and it goes via the North Terminal.

The room at the hotel was very warm, it was clean, shower was nice, towels were very small, and pillows cheap.

It is an average hotel for the price and does the job for a one night stop over. My main complaint would be the distant of the room from the reception. Struggling with a case upstairs with no lifts is hard work.",September 2005,Crowne Plaza Felbridge - Gatwick,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g499616-d248431-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_Felbridge_Gatwick-East_Grinstead_West_Sussex_England.html,"East Grinstead, United Kingdom",hotels,2.0,3.5
Excellent choice,"This hotel is an excellent choice and is a great location for the parks.

We booked our hotel on findorlando rooms and it only cost us £228 for nine nights. The hotel is really easy to find being just off the I4 and International drive. There is plenty of free parking.

Our room had two double beds, a large telly, fridge, microwave, bathroom and still plenty of spare room. The air con was quite noisy but would cool the room down so quickly you could easily leave it off all night.

The room was clean, and housekeeping came round each day. You get a free breakfast, which is very basic but is enough to set up for the days and means you can get the day off to a good start. It does however get busy between 9-10 so I would suggest getting there earlier.

We didn't really have anything to do with the reception so can't comment on that.

The hotel is about a mile away from Universal and two from Sea World. It is also about 100 metres away from the I Trolley stop (although this gets busy), you also have a Walgreens next door and two restaurants.

The pool was small but most the time you would be off doing stuff so it does the trick for a quick dip.

If I were to visit Orlando again I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",September 2005,Comfort Inn International,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34515-d88256-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_International-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.0
