Outlet muhaaa,"First of all, the village looks nice. During corona go there an hiur before closure so it is already less less crowded.

A lot of shops and choice.

But outlet? Black friday? No online or in the city centre the prices are better.

You will have a nice day out for sure",November 2020,Batavia Stad Amsterdam Fashion Outlet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188560-d7104576-Reviews-Batavia_Stad_Amsterdam_Fashion_Outlet-Lelystad_Flevoland_Province.html,"Lelystad, The Netherlands",attractions,1.0,4.0
Worthless staff,"It is corona time also in Amsterdam. Restaurants are closed. So all is delivery or take away. At the Westerpark you can walk thru same nature and have a warm coco and some chrurros if you like.

But BOT at this place.
2 customers in front of you who only take gluwein takes 10 minutes.

Ones you ordered, your food wil not come, you see the cook coming out for a sigaret which is not very helping and 4 other employees(why don't they help at the cash register?) Are just chilling.

After 10 minutes later some is coming to you: ""are you waiting for something?""

After receiving the food it is just ""sorry"". Total atmosphere is already gone.

Worthles staff: not in the mood, dirty and queue that takes ages",November 2020,Westergasterras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188590-d3874037-Reviews-Westergasterras-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",restaurants,1.0,3.5
