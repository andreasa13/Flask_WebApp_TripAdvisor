Excellint tourist spot with great scenery,"At the entrance we found the entrance fee of 230 ZAR too expensive, but by the end of the day we changed our minds. There are 2 trails we visited inside the NP. One led us to the Suspension Bridge. The bridges and the way there are already nice, but there is a viewpoint-hike that starts from the last suspension bridge and takes all the way to the top of the hill next to it. Well, the view up there is what makes the experience worthwhile :)
The other trail took us to a waterfall. Most of the time there were no footpath, we had to climb on bigger-smaller rocks, we enjoyed it a lot. It leads along the ocean, so the view on the way is beautiful. 10/10
