Beautiful view of Acropolis,"the sunset was amazing at this location, the live music was so beautiful, service was the fastest we had encountered on our whole trip and it just felt good to be sitting in the middle of so much good energy and people watch! Food and drinks were fantastic",December 2019,Dionysos Zonar's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1061815-Reviews-Dionysos_Zonar_s-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Get the guide!,Having the guide made this experience so much better than just going up and down and not knowing what it’s about. She explained the history behind every stop we made and when you get to the top-it’s breath taking! Seeing these sites makes you really think about the history of Greece. This was our first visit to Greece and we loved using the guide to take us to the top of Acropolis!,December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Incredible view,"The air up there is just different! So beautiful, so peaceful- don’t get me wrong it’s quite a hike lol but well worth it!

Great time,"It was a wonderful experience- I’ve gotten to know more of the other guests at other wine tastings in different countries but because we were all seated and listening most of the time we didn’t get the opportunity. Spiros was great, very knowledgeable, very friendly, and funny trio. We had a great time- thank you!",December 2019,Athens Wine Tasting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d14895894-Reviews-Athens_Wine_Tasting-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great tourist activity,"Our tour guide, Kevin, was absolutely fantastic! Hilarious, knowledgeable, and super friendly. We enjoyed the tours and his hustle to get us in and out in the time allotted.
