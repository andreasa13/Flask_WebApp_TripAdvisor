Not what I expected,"Unfortunately we had just travelled from Brisbane Southbank Novotel which was amazing so I had high expectations that where not met.
For the price the room was ok however, I ripped bed sheets and a pillow cover that had mold stains. It had been washed but stained, should have been disposed of for health reasons.
The bed was not comfortable at all.
Also we where given a parking ticket for out stay and assumed it was included as we were not advised otherwise... it wasn't. Upon sign out I reported this and was advised it would be investigated and before payment went through, however was sent a bill with not follow up.",July 2019,Novotel Surfers Paradise Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255072-d256746-Reviews-Novotel_Surfers_Paradise_Hotel-Surfers_Paradise_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",hotels,3.0,4.0
