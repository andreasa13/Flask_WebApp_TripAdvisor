Good place for pre-flight drink,"The service was good, the wine of good quality but the only problem I had was finding somewhere to sit. There is a big area for eating but a relatively small area if you only want a drink which meant I had to stand up. Handy for a drink before boarding the flight.",October 2019,London's Pride,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d6852731-Reviews-London_s_Pride-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Great pub,"I liked this place. It is tucked away down a quiet street and a good place to sit outside. I went for the sport on TV, especially the Rugby World Cup. The wine was good and the staff were very good, remembering what I was drinking. Would recommend it.",October 2019,The James Joyce Irish Pub & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2661414-Reviews-The_James_Joyce_Irish_Pub_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Full of history,It was only 5 Euros to get in and what a bargain. It is so impressive with the sun shing off the marble. It is so full of history being the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1896 Olympic Games. The Athens Marathon finishes here. It is quite a magnificent sight and great to walk around the seating. One of my favourite sights of Athens and well worth a visit.,October 2019,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Unmissable,I visited in the afternoon as I hoped a lot of the tours from the cruise ships would have left plus the sunlight would be better for photos. The sun decided not make a show but it was still bright and clear. I entered at the second entrance which was a short walk from Acropolis Metro station and there was only one couple at the ticket office in front of me so sailed in for 20 Euros. The first stop was the Theatre of Dyonisus which was smaller than I was expecting. It is an even climb up to the Parthenon and neighbouring temples. Looking down onto the Theatre of Herod Atticus was a bit disappointing as they seemed to be setting up for a show and there were lots of lights and modern items ruining the view. At the Parthenon there was scaffolding at the front and other construction work going on. There are some wonderful views of the city from the top. All the temples are nearby - my favourite being The Erechtheion with its statues. I exited from the main entrance and turned right and headed down to another famous monument The Tower of Winds then ended up in Monasteraki for a meal.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great value for money,"I had a great stay here although I had a few problems locating it at the end of the day! The self check in was good and I easily entered the place with the door code and found my key and manual located in a box in reception. The room was very spacious and clean with a balcony overlooking the street. There was a kitchenette
with fridge and microwave. It also had a sofa and flat screen TV. WiFi was good. Bathroom was clean with shower gel and shampoo. A little bit noisy with traffic in the morning being on a busy road. The lady on the desk was very friendly and helpful. Across the road was a lovely small locals' taverna. It was a bit further to the Acropolis than I expected to walk it, and without a decent map so walked down the road to the Omonia Metro station and alighted at the Acropolis Metro station which is right next to it. The bed was clean and comfortable and had no noise from any of the other rooms. Not a great deal of restaurants around but I usually ate in the Monasteraki area anyway. It was great value for money. I would stay there again if in Athens.",October 2019,Dima Rooms And Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15642085-Reviews-Dima_Rooms_And_Apartments-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,2.5
Interesting place,"Boasts 'Judith - the world's first airport distillery' and you can actually peer through the window to see it. Nice and spacious, the only drawback for me was the lack of real ale. If you don't like Greene King IPA (which I don't) you have had it. I went for a medium Altoritas Sauvignon at £5.25. A good stop before security.",October 2019,The Nicholas Culpeper,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g191265-d10039664-Reviews-The_Nicholas_Culpeper-Horley_Surrey_England.html,"Horley, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Not as good as it was,I enjoyed my last visit here but this time it was so noisy and after I had got my drink there wasn't anywhere to sit. I don't think it was a great send off before my flight so drank up and found a quieter place near to my gate. Service was good though considering a lot of people were ordering food.,October 2019,The Red Lion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187051-d1998780-Reviews-The_Red_Lion-Crawley_West_Sussex_England.html,"Crawley, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Better and quieter than the Wetherspoons in North Terminal,I was flying from the north terminal but made time to visit here first as it has a better atmosphere and not so noisy. I drank Lagunitas IPA which is good but a bit pricey at £4.60 a bottle. It is named after Gatwick's old Beehive terminal and is spacious and airy. A good stop before the flight. Shuttle bus to North Terminal only takes a few minutes so worth a visit.,October 2019,The Beehive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187051-d3181690-Reviews-The_Beehive-Crawley_West_Sussex_England.html,"Crawley, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Greatest choice of beers for miles,I'm glad we managed to find this place. It is truly a beer-lovers' paradise. So many to choose from although I found a pint of Hold the Line (7.2%) a little too expensive at £7.90 so I plumped for the Bull Walloper cider at 7.2% but only £4.20 a pint. It's not a big place and fills up fairly quickly but we visited on a Saturday afternoon which I think was a good time to visit. A must visit if in Gosport.,July 2019,The Four-Ale Taproom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g616264-d14903377-Reviews-The_Four_Ale_Taproom-Gosport_Hampshire_England.html,"Gosport, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good selection of beer and cider,I visit here quite a lot as there is always a nice atmosphere (in the afternoon at least) and there is always a good selection of beer and cider - Black Dragon being my favourite. Staff are great although sometimes there doesn't seem enough to serve at the bar and also clear the tables etc. One of my favourite pubs in town.,August 2019,The Sir John Baker,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186298-d6717692-Reviews-The_Sir_John_Baker-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great for good value food and drink,It is always fairly busy but I always manage to find a good seat - preferably one in one of the booths. The food is good value and I haven't ever had to complain. The service is normally pretty good and the staff friendly and their is football on TV. One small thing for me is that I would like too see a few more stronger beers on draught as they always seem to be weak 'session' beers. Also the guest cider on draught is never one of the better ones. Other than that an OK place.,August 2019,The First Post,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186298-d7057188-Reviews-The_First_Post-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
One of the better Wetherspoons,There is always a great selection of good beer on tap and better still they nearly always have Black Dragon cider available which is my favourite. It is bright and airy and if they are showing sports on the TV there is always a good place to sit or stand. The staff are very friendly and helpful especially when I had left something behind on a previous visit. There is a small area outside for smoking but what I like is the service is very good and I don't have to wait long to be served and it's always with a smile. The only downside for me is on Pompey home game days it gets understandably far too crowded.,August 2019,The John Jacques,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186298-d8685205-Reviews-The_John_Jacques-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good selection of real ales,"A good pub to visit if you like real ales as there were six to choose from when I visited including Horizon, Timothy Taylor's Landlord and Doom Bar but I went for Ghost Ship IPA at 4.5% which seemed to be the strongest. I find the session beers a bit wishy washy and lacking in character and taste. Something with a bit more oomph would have been nice. Nice decor and atmosphere but hard to believe it is Portsmouth's oldest pub as obviously very little is left of any original olde worlde character after all the alterations over the years. Apparently Nelson scratched his name on one of the walls which is now protected by a glass screen but I couldn't see it!",July 2019,The Dolphin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186298-d2357254-Reviews-The_Dolphin-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Good locals' pub,"It is what a pub should be like. Nice friendly atmosphere, good service and full of character. There aren't many pubs like this any more, most of which have been turned into posh restaurants. There is some interesting nautical memorabilia on the walls. The only down side for me was there wasn't enough selection of real ale. There were only three on tap including London Pride and Bass. I can't say I am a fan of any of them which is why I didn't stay longer.",July 2019,The Pembroke,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186298-d12945005-Reviews-The_Pembroke-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great place for craft beer lovers,It is a very interesting place and the lady running the bar was very friendly and helpful. It has a great selection of ales and also my favourite cider - Black Dragon. I think this is my favourite place in Shirley as not only is the beer good but the place itself is quaint and full of character. I wish it was nearer to home for me.,July 2019,The Witch's Brew,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186299-d13326487-Reviews-The_Witch_s_Brew-Southampton_Hampshire_England.html,"Southampton, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
Good place for craft beer lovers,It's not very big and maybe lacks a bit of character but who cares when the beer is good and there is a good choice. I decided to go for the Collision which was a bit on the strong side but very nice. It is a nice place and the service and staff were good. Will visit again when next in Shirley.,July 2019,Overdraft Craft Ale Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186299-d15039232-Reviews-Overdraft_Craft_Ale_Bar-Southampton_Hampshire_England.html,"Southampton, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Improved since my last visit,I last visited here about 4 years ago and was disappointed with the lack of choice when it came to cask ales and ciders. On this return visit I was pleasantly surprised as the selection of cask ales had improved and I could even get a pint of my favourite cider - Black Dragon. Service was good and the decor seemed a lot more interesting than before although I could have missed it on my last visit. Very good value for money and quality good.,July 2019,Denmead Queen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1544636-d2558304-Reviews-Denmead_Queen-Waterlooville_Hampshire_England.html,"Waterlooville, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Very nice relaxed drink,"Popped in here with a friend after a hot summer's day walk on Catherington Down. The landlady was very friendly and the service very good. I had the seasonal Sticky Wicket Pale Ale and along with my friend's HSB both were of very good quality - crisp, very clear and tasted very nice. The place was very quiet and relaxing and the decor very good.",July 2019,The Farmer Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1636992-d2342013-Reviews-The_Farmer_Inn-Horndean_Waterlooville_Hampshire_England.html,"Horndean, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
OK for a quick drink,This is a typical sports bar and caters very well. The staff were great but my draught ESB was not of very good quality at all. It was not clear and had a strange taste like it was the first one of the day and it had been in the pipes all night. The place lacked character as well and is not really my kind of pub but is popular and seems to be well run but I think the cellar management could be improved.,July 2019,The Heroes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1544636-d4107813-Reviews-The_Heroes-Waterlooville_Hampshire_England.html,"Waterlooville, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Better inside than out,On first sight from the car park I was expecting to enter a sports bar with lots of TVs and noisy customers but on entering I was pleasantly surprised as it was quite a nice roomy but cosy place with a selection of real ales and quite nicely decorated - and not a TV in sight. At least I didn't see one. It is not cheap with a pint of Forty Niner costing £5 a pint. Food was a bit too pricey for me but at they do cater for vegetarians and vegans. Toilets were clean and staff friendly.,July 2019,The Woodpecker Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1544636-d3395364-Reviews-The_Woodpecker_Pub-Waterlooville_Hampshire_England.html,"Waterlooville, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good value and service,I have been here many times and no matter how busy it is outside it is always fairly easy to get served at the bar. Cosy without feeling too stuffy. The beer is always pretty good and there is plenty of seating. Situated in a pedestrianised precinct so quiet without any noise or fumes from traffic outside. I had an Old Thumper which was of good quality and very reasonably priced and my friend had a coffee that he could keep going back for a refill which made my round very good value.,July 2019,The Lord Palmerston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186298-d2617199-Reviews-The_Lord_Palmerston-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Lacking in character,Not badly decorated and quite airy but a bit plastic and lacking in atmosphere. Lots of beers but all a bit wishy washy and the Chieftain I was drinking tasted a bit strange and at £5 a pint you expect a better quality beer. Only two real ales on when I was there - Frigate and Panther - but didn't want to chance one as even my keg beer didn't taste that great.,July 2019,Meat and Barrel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186298-d7342977-Reviews-Meat_and_Barrel-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Nothing Special,"It is nice to be able to walk along and have a drink outside without the noise and fumes from the traffic. The Food Festival is very, very busy and seems to have more stalls selling alcohol than food! There was a band playing which was OK but not outstanding. Not the cheapest place to buy food but a lot is home-grown etc. The pubs situated along the road were not that busy when I visited during the Food Festival on the Sunday. Nice to visit once but too many people for me.",July 2019,Palmerston Road,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186298-d12723885-Reviews-Palmerston_Road-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,3.5
Friendliest Hard Rock Cafe I have ever visited.,"It became a home from home for me during my weeks long stay in Siem Reap. I was initially tempted by the Happy Hour of three drinks for the price of two between 3 and 6 but after a few visits I was felt so welcome and felt like one of the family I began to become a regular, especially after my long cycle rides to Phnom Kraom and back when by the time I got to the Hard Rock I was in dire need of refreshment! There was a security guard outside minding the motorbikes etc so there was no need to even lock up my cycle knowing it would be safe. The wine was of good quality and there was no rush to drink in the allocated time which I found a very nice gesture compared to some other places I have visited. I was even invited to join in the 48th birthday celebrations of the Hard Rock Cafe - which began in London - which made me feel quite honoured. Around the restaurant on the walls is pop memorabilia including guitars from the Eagles' Joe Walsh, Sting and Jon Bon Jovi. There are plenty of pop videos being played but not too intrusively. There is a live band nearly every night until late but I find late afternoon a great time to relax and have a few drinks.Great atmosphere and nice people. Will be back hopefully later this year.",June 2019,Hard Rock Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d6782152-Reviews-Hard_Rock_Cafe-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Friendly pub with great beer,One of the best traditional pubs in Gosport if not the best. The landlady is so welcoming and friendly and there was a good choice of beer. I had the Fallen Acorn Expedition which Is brewed in Gosport. The locals are really friendly and the pub itself is cosy and has a lot of memorabilia to look at. The beer garden is good too with a small well full of goldfish. A curiosity is that on the wall outside above the main entrance are two stone heads - one of a king that is in Queens Road - and one of a queen that is in Kings Road!,July 2019,Queens Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616264-d12205927-Reviews-Queens_Hotel-Gosport_Hampshire_England.html,"Gosport, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good traditional pub,Stopped here with friends while walking around Gosport. Nice friendly place and good quality beer on tap and only around £3 a pint happy hour. The beer garden at the back is quite cosy and a good sun trap. I'm glad we found it and will visit when next in Gosport.,July 2019,Five Alls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g616264-d7264464-Reviews-Five_Alls-Gosport_Hampshire_England.html,"Gosport, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great place for a beer and a chat,The place says it all. It is like being in a local pub back home in UK. A lot of time and care is taken producing the next brew and you can sometimes see them making it in the bar area itself which is interesting. I always get a very warm welcome and look at the list to see which beer to try next. They also sell beers from other microbreweries in Cambodia. My favourite beer is Apology Juice but Mojob is also a good brew. There is a nice small beer garden at the side of the building. Definitely worth a visit if in Siem Reap.,June 2019,The Local - Brew Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d12999288-Reviews-The_Local_Brew_Pub-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great British pub,A real local expat’s place with a great selection of food including Australian steak and my favourite cottage pie. The wine is reasonably priced at 120bht a glass until 8pm and there is always a good selection of sport on the TVs. The staff are 100% and always welcome me back when I’ve been away for a few months or more. It’s not the biggest place in town and if I have one very small gripe is the fact that people can smoke in the bar which puts me off if I am eating.,July 2019,Chequers British Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d1650421-Reviews-Chequers_British_Pub-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great breakfast,"This is a good value place, one that I visit for their amazingly good value breakfast for 125bht.

Very airy with plenty of seating and the service is very good.",July 2019,Bus Stop Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293916-d3588326-Reviews-Bus_Stop_Bar-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",attractions,4.0,3.5
Good meeting place,I was a regular visitor to the Brothers Restaurant for about six weeks. Cocktails were only $1.50 and the service was very good. The place is part of the Made in Cambodia complex and is very open plan so not too claustrophobic like some places. Used to meet up with my friends here around six every evening. Plenty of motorcycle parking.,June 2019,The Brothers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d10376430-Reviews-The_Brothers-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Great for good value food and drink,Visited here a lot when I was in Bangkok. What attracted me first was the happy hour wine which was 99bht from opening time until 7pm. Good place to watch sports. I was there when England were playing New Zealand in the Cricket World Cup so a good atmosphere. The portions of the food are very good. I had two giant Cumberland sausages with mash and gravy. Service was very good and always with a smile.,July 2019,The Kiwi Sports Pub & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d1648376-Reviews-The_Kiwi_Sports_Pub_Grill-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Best place in Phnom Penh,I loved my visits to Cerevisia Beer Garden when I was in Phnom Penh. There was a very good selection of great beer and all the staff were super friendly and I felt really welcome. Quite a cosy place located between two buildings with it's little 'beer museum' collection of beer cans old and new. Happy hour is between 4pm and 5pm where you can get two for the price of one and also you can get the beer in proper pint glasses. My favourites were the Great Glen IPA and Imperial IPA but all the ones I tried were good.

OK for a cheap drink,It is quite unusual as the guest house and restaurants face each other on either side of the road. I stop by for a glass or two of wine as it it is good value. I used to like the Sunday roasts but this time instead of sliced beef I had a small steak which I found quite chewy. The staff are OK as is the service but the quality of the meat needs to be improved.,June 2019,Golden Home Guesthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293940-d4500591-Reviews-Golden_Home_Guesthouse-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",hotels,3.0,3.0
Hidden gem,It is tucked away in a quiet spot on the outskirts of town so is a nice quiet place to sit and try the craft beer. Yuki the owner was very friendly as were the other customers. I tried the Flowers Abbey which was pretty strong at 8.1%. I also tried a bottle of Duck Walk which was excellent.

Great place to relax,"Visited a few times. It is like a luxury hotel pool next to a beach but is in the middle of the town. The $5 entry fee you can claim back if buying drinks or food. Very quiet when I first visited but on my next few visits there was almost too many people in the pool so impossible to do any swimming, especially when the water polo was in full swing. The toilets are quite interesting with an industrial theme in the gents with oil cans being used as soap dispensers.

Average for a Hard Rock Cafe,"It's not the most interesting Hard Rock Cafe I have visited. In fact it was quite ordinary. Happy hour is OK as you get three wines for the price of two. I like to walk around Hard Rocks and look at the pop memorabilia on the walls but here there was hardly any, just a few guitars from musicians, some I have never heard of. It does not come close to the one in Siem Reap where there is a lot more to see and the staff are a lot friendlier.",May 2019,Hard Rock Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293940-d13009911-Reviews-Hard_Rock_Cafe-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Good place for a drink with a view,"I went here nearly every night when in Kampong Cham. It is a good place for a drink although the cocktail list didn't include White Russian which is what I prefer. The views are really good, especially late afternoon when the light is better. I did have a few problems getting served at times but otherwise OK. There was a resident band playing in the evenings which were OK but the DJ that took over when they went for a break played irritating overly-loud music.",April 2019,LBN Asian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g659642-d11996000-Reviews-LBN_Asian_Restaurant-Kampong_Cham_Kampong_Cham_Province.html,"Kampong Cham, Cambodia",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Nice place for a Happy Hour drink,You cannot complain when a glass of wine only costs $1.50 during Happy Hour. I nearly always sat in the same spot so the staff got to know me.

Nice friendly place,I would pop in daily when in Kampot for a few drinks as I liked the airy feel to it and the staff were very friendly and welcoming.

Fantastic place with great burgers and a friendly welcome,I thoroughly enjoyed visiting the Laundry Cafe during my stay in Kampot. It is a very cosy friendly place and John was very kind to me when he found out I was struggling with a broken foot.

OK for a late afternoon drink,I didn't stay here but just by chance decided to give it a go as it was late afternoon and wanted somewhere different to try for a beverage. The staff were very friendly and the service quick and as it was happy hour I had two white Russians for $3.50. Being on the corner it is a good place to watch the world go by if a little noisy.

Good location,"Good, clean accommodation within easy walking distance of the Royal Palace, museum and the riverside. It is in a street with numerous bars and restaurants. The staff were very friendly too. There is construction work going on at the back so it could a bit noisy in the morning. Still a good choice.",January 2019,Mama's Villa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293940-d7277455-Reviews-Mama_s_Villa-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",hotels,4.0,4.0
Good place while waiting for flight,It is more a coffee shop than a pub but still a good place where you can sit at the bar with a beer and watch sport on the TV. I had a couple of glasses of wine which weren't cheap but not overly expensive for an airport. I found the service was OK and I could pay with contactless debit card which meant I didn't need any local currency.,October 2018,Java House Jomo Kenyatta Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294207-d3339972-Reviews-Java_House_Jomo_Kenyatta_Airport-Nairobi.html,"Nairobi, Kenya",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Smooth flight,No complaints about the flight. The inflight entertainment was good and the cabin staff helpful. The food was good and there was a fair amount of legroom. Certainly would fly with them again.,October 2018,Air France,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729003-Reviews-Air-France,World,flights,4.0,3.5
Good flight,It wasn't a long flight but the checking in went smoothly and my flight left on time. Despite me having two more connecting flights to follow my luggage arrived at my final destination OK.,October 2018,South African Airways,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729155-Reviews-South-African-Airways,World,flights,4.0,3.5
Smooth flight but inflight drinks VERY expensive,Almost everything was fine with the flight. The checking in was so quick and easy and although we were a little late taking off we arrived in Bangkok pretty much on time. The food was OK although not a great selection but what annoyed me was having to pay 7 Euros for a small bottle of wine! Of all the long haul flights I have been on the drinks are complimentary. I think it is a bit bad having to pay this after paying enough for my ticket. Inflight entertainment was good as was the service.,November 2018,Finnair,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729078-Reviews-Finnair,World,flights,3.0,4.0
Better than I was expecting,I found it a good experience flying to Nairobi. I checked in very quickly and my flight took off pretty much on time. The inflight entertainment was good as was the food and the complimentary drinks. Staff were OK and my suitcase arrived with no problems at my destination as I had another connecting flight. I would fly with them again as it was good value for money.,October 2018,Kenya Airways,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729102-Reviews-Kenya-Airways,World,flights,4.0,3.0
Nice place but very expensive,I had a few hours stopover so decided to come here for a relaxing drink. I bought two small bottles of rose wine that were in a basket near to the till and it was lucky I had my debit card on me as I didn't have enough Euros. The service was quite quick though and it was a nice place to relax.,November 2018,Nordic Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g226906-d11905651-Reviews-Nordic_Kitchen-Vantaa_Uusimaa.html,"Vantaa, Finland",restaurants,3.0,3.5
"Nice place, great value, super staff but problems with WiFi","This a great place and great value for money. The staff are super and the room good and very quiet. The bathroom was spotless although I found the shower tray a little slippery.There is a nice bar area and the food in the evening was good although my portion of beef bourguignon on my last night was a bit small for £9.75. The staff were very helpful especially when I wanted them to put on the TV for the football. The only problem I had was with the WiFi. I just could not connect despite registering. The receptionist contacted the provider by phone but I still had to resolve to four days without WiFi. Also, I do not see why if I could actually connect I am only allowed 30 free minutes a day and then if I want any more I would have to pay £3. There is a handy Hoppa bus for £4.50 that takes you direct from the entrance to Terminal 3. Bus stops into Hounslow itself just a short walk away. A nice place to stay.",October 2018,Travelodge Heathrow Central,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g528813-d1200870-Reviews-Travelodge_Heathrow_Central-Hounslow_Greater_London_England.html,"Hounslow, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
OK pub,Nice to find a British style pub just before boarding for my flight but it was just too busy and noisy for me and after getting my expensive glass of wine I could not find anywhere to sit. It is an OK place and the staff were pretty quick at serving but not my favourite airport pub.,October 2018,The Prince of Wales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d11930723-Reviews-The_Prince_of_Wales-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Amazing site even in dry season,I crossed over the border from Livingstone to see the falls from the Zimbabwe side as it was supposed to be better than the Zambian. It is a strange border crossing walking past dozens of lorries parked alongside the road. There were no queues as I bought my $30 ticket. The view of the falls is only a fairly short scenic walk away and first you can hear the roar of the falls themselves and finally see the falls with all the spray drifting into the air - 'the smoke that thunders'. It was a breathtaking site considering it was dry season I was only expecting a trickle. The gardens are nice to walk round and there is a statue of David Livingstone who was the first European to reach the falls and named them after the queen. There is a cafe and souvenir shop and good toilets. At the border on my way back I had to wait an hour to clear immigration even though I already had a Kaza visa so next time I will make sure I spend more time in Victoria Falls town itself to make it worthwhile.,November 2018,Victoria Falls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293761-d11929139-Reviews-Victoria_Falls-Victoria_Falls_Matabeleland_North_Province.html,"Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe",attractions,5.0,5.0
Interesting but expensive,It is an interesting museum built on the site of the Zambezi sawmills and has a good collection of old steam engines and carriages. It is located on the outskirts of town but easy to find. The only downside is the exorbitant $15 entrance fee which probably explains why I was the only one there. After buying my ticket the man on the desk gave me short talk on the history of the Zambezi sawmills and explained some of the photos on the walls. Some of the trains have information boards while others do not. There is a first class Rhodesia Railways carriage that you can walk through. Incorporated in the museum is the Jewish museum which gives information on the Jewish in Zambia. I took around two hours to look round it and take pictures. It is open all the year round.,November 2018,Railway Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298089-d4133890-Reviews-Railway_Museum-Livingstone_Southern_Province.html,"Livingstone, Zambia",attractions,4.0,3.5
Good value food and drink,A nice place for a drink and a meal at very good prices. I had a steak for 45 kwacha whereas in another place I went to the same thing cost me 110 kwacha. The wine was very good value too at 18 kwacha a glass. It is a very big place that sells ice cream at the front and has large screen TVs showing sports. The staff were very friendly too.,November 2018,Da Canton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298089-d7350399-Reviews-Da_Canton-Livingstone_Southern_Province.html,"Livingstone, Zambia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Lovely steak,"I popped down here for a meal as I was staying at the Travelodge up the road. Lucky for me they had sirloin steak on special at £6.99. I had mine with a jacket potato and I was very pleased with the quality of the steak. There were a lot of beers to choose from, the atmosphere was relaxed and the staff and service were good.",November 2018,Moon under Water,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g528813-d3622814-Reviews-Moon_under_Water-Hounslow_Greater_London_England.html,"Hounslow, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good place for a drink before flying,"Service was very quick, staff friendly and the atmosphere was good. I can't say it is the easiest place to find but I am glad I found it. The decor is very nice with some interesting pictures on the wall. The breakfast is a bit pricey but is expected at the airport.",November 2018,The Darwin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g528813-d14142320-Reviews-The_Darwin-Hounslow_Greater_London_England.html,"Hounslow, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
OK but no character,It all seemed a bit plastic with no atmosphere and the service was slow unless you wanted a table to dine and then they were very helpful. I just wanted a couple of drinks before my flight and found it difficult to get served. The Malbec was a steep £7.80 and the selection of bottled beer wasn't good. It seemed the only place for a drink so they have the monopoly.,October 2018,Oriel Grande Brasserie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d3377354-Reviews-Oriel_Grande_Brasserie-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
More on natural history than Livingstone,It is a nice museum but I was expecting more on the life of David Livingstone which was contained mostly in one room near the end of the tour. Mostly it is to do with the natural history of the area which is very good but not what I was expecting. The David Livingstone exhibition itself is interesting and on display is his hat and coat. The clock tower entrance is worth a photo along with the statue of Livingstone outside. There is a small shop inside. Puzzling to me is when I paid my entrance fee I had to collect my change on the way out!,October 2018,Livingstone Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298089-d472567-Reviews-Livingstone_Museum-Livingstone_Southern_Province.html,"Livingstone, Zambia",attractions,3.0,4.0
Good place for a drink in the afternoon,I liked to visit for a drink in the afternoon as you can sit outside and at the weekends they show all the sports on TV which suited me being a football fan. The staff were friendly and helpful putting on any game you wanted to watch. I used to order a bottle of wine and relax. It is located at the back which would help if they had a sign at the front as I nearly carried on walking on my first visit as I thought it was closed.,October 2018,Zest Bar and Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298089-d12330631-Reviews-Zest_Bar_and_Restaurant-Livingstone_Southern_Province.html,"Livingstone, Zambia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
