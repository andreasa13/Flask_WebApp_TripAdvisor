Must visit,"The Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut, also known as the Djeser-Djeseru (Ancient Egyptian: ḏsr ḏsrw ""Holy of Holies""), is a mortuary temple of Ancient Egypt located in Upper Egypt. Built for the Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Hatshepsut, who died in 1458 BC, the temple is located beneath the cliffs at Deir el-Bahari on the west bank of the Nile near the Valley of the Kings. This mortuary temple is dedicated to Amun and Hatshepsut and is situated next to the mortuary temple of Mentuhotep II, which served both as an inspiration and, later, a quarry. It is considered one of the ""incomparable monuments of ancient Egypt.""

The relief sculpture within Hatshepsut’s temple recites the tale of the divine birth of a female pharaoh – the first of its kind. The text and pictorial cycle also tell of an expedition to the Land of Punt, an exotic country on the Red Sea coast. While the statues and ornamentation have since been stolen or destroyed, the temple once was home to two statues of Osiris, a sphinx avenue as well as many sculptures of the Queen in different attitudes – standing, sitting, or kneeling. Many of these portraits were destroyed at the order of her stepson Thutmose III after her death.",February 2021,Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el Bahari,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294205-d318962-Reviews-Temple_of_Hatshepsut_at_Deir_el_Bahari-Luxor_Nile_River_Valley.html,"Luxor, Egypt",attractions,5.0,4.5

Preferably by car, because the road is splendid. Nature is revealed in admirable beauty. Ialomita Cave is at an altitude of 1.500 m on the right side of the Ialomitei Canyon.
At the entrance to the cave is a monastery (Ialomitei Monastery), built in the sixteenth century, founded by the Voivode of Romanian Country, Mihnea the Evil.
Cave takes place on one level over a length of approximately 480 m, of which 400 m are accessible to tourists, to the point called ""the Shrine"" upstream portion followed by another 80 m, with galleries and halls.
The cave has a mixed development, presenting both galleries and halls. The cave is modernized, well maintained, illuminated, clean. On the inside of the cave there are often exposed panels with information about the history and geography of the place (also in English).
At the entrance you get the headcover for head protection. You have to wear it. Have thick clothes, because inside, in the cave, it's cool and high humidity.

"Smart hotel, indeed","We stayed in Sinaia, at Smart Hotel with our dear Grivei (bernese mountain dog, 6 years old, about 60 kilograms) for three nights, full weekend in November 2017. We found the hotel on Tripadvisor, we liked tourists' impressions and called for reservation.
Upon arrival, we were pleasantly impressed from all points of view: hotel location, reception service, exterior and interior design, landscaping, cleaning, restaurant, spacious room, outdoor garden and trout river, parking. But I will tell them one by one.

Indoor:
The room is generous, very clean, with modern pieces of furniture and well maintained, large and comfortable bed and beautiful decorations. Big and very clean bathroom, showers with massage.
The balcony in the room is a very pleasant surprise, being like a spacious terrace with chairs and a table, with a superb view, clean air, quiet and bird song. Amazing view from our room.
Even if it is not huge, the hotel has an elevator which helps a lot if you have luggage’s. The reception area is not very spacious .... but the common spaces of the hotel (interior staircase, hallways) are wide.

Outdoor:
Outside you can find the big surprise, especially if you are a nature lover.
The green space is landscaped, like a botanical garden. With an impressive variety of trees and plants, specific to mountain climatic conditions. A wealth of colors in all shades of green and brick. The entire courtyard is set up on high-rise steps, with sidewalks sloping among the garden plants. Each plant is very well maintained and has a story to tell ....
In some areas of the garden, exists small islands for relaxing and serving dinner (little private tree corner).
At the boundary of the property, the river is arranged likes a waterfall, and represents its own fish farm (trout).

Pet friendly:
Pets are allowed and the tax is free! Grivei was happy and treated with all the friendship and admiration at this hotel.

Services:
Staff in this hotel is nice and friendly. All employees are nice, helpful, and attentive.
From an architectural point of view, the restaurant is very original. The walls exhibit an impressive and unique collection of corkscrews (entered in the Guinness Book). The atmosphere is pleasant and quiet. Culinary preparations are tasty. The breakfast is not very varied, but was fine for us for all mornings.
