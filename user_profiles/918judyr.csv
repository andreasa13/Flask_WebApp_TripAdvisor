A bit of a disappointment,Had reservations for dinner . It was to be the highlight of our Broadway stay but felt dinner was not up to our expectations. Ordered the scallops and pork belly dinner. It came with two small scallops and literally a brushstroke of the butternut squash. The pork was rather plain tho tender and the pork skin crisps were so hard I thought I might break a tooth.

Good family location,"This is a beautifully designed resort with a great pool, very good restaurant, and knowledgeable, helpful staff.
