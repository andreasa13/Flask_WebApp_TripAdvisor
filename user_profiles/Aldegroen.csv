Disappointed,"Our communication with Michael matched his company’s logo, it was Amazing, so we were expecting an amazing time. Unfortunately our tour was not up to our expectations. It was basically an expensive taxi service with the driver taking us from location to location with minimum information provided. We were disappointed…

Not up to our expectations…",September 2018,Michael's Amazing Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d9798835-Reviews-Michael_s_Amazing_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,1.0,5.0

An absolute must see!!,"An absolute must see. A breathtaking piece of history that comes to life right before your eyes. The 360 view is spectacular too. Make sure to reach the site early in the morning, upon opening, otherwise you will find it crowded. Unfortunately our driver did not warn us about this and we spent valuable time waiting and waiting. Look out for the slippery steps and make sure to have water with you.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
