Excellent,"This hotel is on the edge if the city. Easy access by metro. The decor and service is top quality and the restaurant food is amazingly delicious with generous portions. Staff are friendly and helpful. The pool is small but adequate. My only complaint is the steps into / out of the pool are small. They need an extra step at the bottom and top as it is difficult if you are not aged 30 or do not have long legs.

Xmas treat with friends,Busy busy time of year. Managed to get a table. Fair menu - 2 or 3 courses. The beef was amazingly tasty !!disappointed in the Xmas pudding.

Pre panto,We have eaten here pre panto ladies lunch for the last 5 years. It is always the Christmas menu in December. The food is always well cooked and the service good (we do pre order food) however all 18 of us were disappointed in the Xmas menu choices - nearly all ended up with the daily special of fish & chips or burger. We have had my her nicer choices in the past. Also we asked if we could order pie from the normal menu but was told no. Only to discover pie had been added when we arrived on the day.

Disappointed,"We tried this restaurant following a recommendation but we were disappointed. The noise levels were very high possibly due to the high ceilings. The menu seemed comprehensive but the quality was not so good. Mussels in garlic sauce - the garlic was chunky hard and raw. Not a pleasant taste. The salad was a huge bowl of lettuce mainly. The order was prepared wrong so the salad came before the grilled chicken breast. Then the breast was coated in something. Steaks were not the nicest we have had in South Africa. They had run out of draught beer.
Disappointing",September 2019,Meeurots Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608448-d3687202-Reviews-Meeurots_Restaurant-Yzerfontein_Western_Cape.html,"Yzerfontein, South Africa",restaurants,2.0,3.5

Brilliant,"From the minute we crossed the entrance we were amazed. Delayed by a family of baboons we got lots of pics. Slow drive down to the point where we spotted an ostrich. Bit too far in the distance to photograph. The funicular ride to the lighthouse was amazing and we explored from all angles. Got lots of photos of the point and peninsula. Amazing coves and beaches below.
Great value for money. Plenty of toilet opportunities. Well stocked shops
Would definitely recommend. We had a much better ostrich shot on the way back. Spent a good couple of hours there. Arrived early it was empty but very quickly filled with coach tours and mini busses

Excellent location,"We have just stayed here for 3 nights. Paid extra for waterfront marina view. We were not disappointed with the apartment it was huge 2 bedrooms both with en-suite large longe and fully equipped kitchen.
When we arrived the main TV would not work and the agent couldn’t fix it.
The housekeeping came as promised on the Monday but only did one bedroom and bathroom so bit disappointing otherwise would have scored 5
Safe underground parking with lift access to our door. Security 24/7 on the entrance to the complex
The location is excellent and we have spent all our time in the V& A waterfront. The food is amazing at fantastic prices.
Beware of world travel plugs. We were left with no chargers until the last night when the agent came to our help as the plugs are big thick round pins.

Winter retreat,"For our first ever winter holiday this was fabulous. Nothing outside the hotels to really see or do but plenty in the hotel. 5 min transfer time from the airport. You can see the hotel from airport car park
All inclusive buffets were amazing with food to suit ever taste and need. 3 speciality restaurants which you have to book well in advance. - do it as soon as you arrive !
Areas around the hotel are well kept and clean but some areas a little ‘tired’ and in need of a bit of TLC. Probably due to the hotel being an all year round resort. People were friendly. Service excellent. We had a couple of minor room issues while we were there but these were dealt with quickly and professionally.

Perfect venue,"We booked 2 weeks here with another couple and were very pleased with the location and setting. I think the staff are used to people passing through for a few nights but it was nice to get to know people on our longer stay.
The room were nice - one had a small patio / sitting area, our room didnt as they only had one available when we booked.
It was very clean and well serviced. The hotel provide 2 sun beds and an umbrella on the beach with your room number on
The beach is fine shingle and very clean.
Wifi was available in the main eating areas an on the beach directly in front of the hotel but in our rooms (13 & 1) the signal was very poor
Food was very good in both the cafe (limited menu) and the restaurant
Breakfast (included) was very comprehensive just let down by the fact the 'hot' breakfast items were far from warm let alone hot ! (Bacon, sausage, scrambled & fried eggs)
Lovely coffees and teas selection and local cheese & meats with gorgeous crusty bread.
Lots of fruit and cakes
There are a couple of pieces of fitness equipment on the paved area above the beach along with showers toilets & changing facilities.
You need a car as taxis are mega expensive and we didn't see any local transport
The rooms had a tv, air conditioning, a fridge and a safe
Our bathroom was nice but the shower was getting read for replacement.

Great find,"We have lived 2 miles from here for years and never been in. Had a recommendation. Managed to get a last minute table and was not disappointed. The Gin choice was amazing ! Had its own menu. The staff were friendly attentive and helpful without being intrusive !
Menu choice was brilliant - the regular menu supplemented by a ‘specials’ and pies menu.
We all had a different starter and main and they were all delicious. The ham hock was huge and very tasty. The lamb shank fell off the bone. Chicken pie was one of the best I had ever had and the grey mullet was lovely.
Puddings were light and tasty - my only disappointment was the crumble could do with a bit more crumble (my personal taste) and either custard or 2 scoops of the sorbet. But that’s being nit picky. The sticky toffee pudding was light and yummy.

Extremely dated,"We stayed here with a coach trip / tour weekend
The hotel was busy.
The decor is tired and extremely dated some areas bordering on dilapidated.
There was a tv. Kettle in the room but the curtains were paper thin. Not very clean and the bathroom needed a complete overhaul.
The bedding was clean. Extra pillows were available. The doors all banged when you closed them so there is no way you could be quiet. The sofas in the lounges were filthy and everywhere needed a lick of paint. The food was basic the quiche would have been improved if it had been warmed and the lamb was thin and mass produced (processed)
The best meal was the buffet breakfast. This could have been slightly better had there been some beans as well as tomatoes and a chiller for the juice.
The pool was filthy and clearly needed a good clean so we didn’t venture.
There is a parrot in the reception and 2 behind reception that frankly were smelly and needed cleaning out.
Plenty of scope for improvement.
There was a ballroom downstairs with nightly entertainment but the bar on the ground floor was only open briefly at tea time meaning the guests who wanted to stay in the quieter lounges had to go to the noisy dark ballroom for drinks.

Cocktails by the pool are essential. The busiest pool times are after breakfast and evening as people await the sunset. Quieter midday and early afternoon.
Great observation deck and views of the F1 track.

The restaurants serve beautiful food - I will review them individually - but are quite expensive and as there is very little around the hotel there is nowhere cheaper to go.
We paid around £40 per person each night
Which is quite expensive in Malaysia in comparison to other restaurants and we were told food at the sister hotel is cheaper
The grounds were lovely with plenty of beds and there was a nice touch in the afternoon with cold flannels followed by complimentary fruit and an ice cream
There was a 'happy hour' I the bar 5-6pm and 7-8pm but limited drinks available and the happy hour price was not really cheap

Fab Hotel,"This hotel is well placed to access the city. Lovely hotel great food, great pool, helpful staff

Ticked the box,"Ideally placed, access to lake front, shops, bars restaurants, breakfast on the expensive side but clean, good food,
Ideal for a sightseeing city break
Rooms are compact but beds very comfortable. Bathroom is a 'pod' but adequate.

Lovely food,"We ate here 3 nights in a row while staying in the Ibis Paradiso just across the road. Limited menu but excellent food, burgers were delicious some served with potato Rosti Some with cheese and / or eggs. Mixed salads were great. Service was friendly.
Out door eating at its best. Ice cream dessert prices extortionate !! Main meals average prices for the area.
French fries were delicious and you got a huge plateful !
They have a cakes / pastries/ coffee shop but we only ate evening meal. Alcohol was served and beer was cold",September 2016,Münger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188095-d3354500-Reviews-Munger-Lugano_Canton_of_Ticino_Swiss_Alps.html,"Lugano, Switzerland",restaurants,5.0,4.0

A truely hidden gem,"We found this gem after a search for child friendly restaurants in Sheffield. 8 of us looking for a venue for my daughters 30th birthday. We found it straight away because the other helpful reviews warned us what to look for. We were not disappointed the service was with a smile, the food was outstanding. The students were amazing. Cannot fault it in any way in fact I took a friend back today and they recognised us from the week before. Again the food was amazing. We will be visiting many times more for sure",July 2016,The Hidden Gem,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d4262018-Reviews-The_Hidden_Gem-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Mediocre,"We booked a table for 18 people for my daughters 30th birthday.The nachos on the table were a nice touch. Waiter was very friendly and quite efficient. Food was fine but not outstanding, Average service time but we heard other waiters apologising for big delays. Sombreros were fun and kids enjoyed them wile we waited for food. Might go again but other places to try first",July 2016,Chiquito,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d2233648-Reviews-Chiquito-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Beautiful,"A group booking for 12 people we were seated to time the restaurant is decorated beautifully. Comprehensive menu, friendly staff but £1.40 for a lime & soda ????
Food was lovely maybe a bit of gentle background music would ha been nice as the talking got quite overpowering at times as it was very busy.
Outside sitting area for drinks and downstairs bar / meeting area was lovely
Food average prices for Italian restaurant",July 2016,Capri at The Vine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190729-d10366479-Reviews-Capri_at_The_Vine-Wakefield_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Excellent food,"As a lover of Tapas we tried for the first time on a recommendation. Staff were friendly and helpful. We had olives and the beautiful cured Jamon for nibbles.
We were so enthusiastic we forgot to take photos !
The selections of tapas were pretty good and the food kept coming as we were eating. All well cooked and nicely presented we all had our favourites.
The Sangria was lovely but the gins were amazing just as they should be - large glass lots of ice
The Churros were gorgeous. We were not rushed and the atmosphere was great

Will definitely return",July 2016,Tapas Revolution Meadowhall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d10129422-Reviews-Tapas_Revolution_Meadowhall-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Popular place,"I took my grandson to a party after school so the place was heaving. There were 3 parties so hundreds of kids.
The parties were well organised and seemed to flow.
We ordered food and despite how busy it came fairly quickly.
Attempts were made by staff to keep older children out of the younger areas but they have added a ball area where they are sucked up the tubes then drop when the hopper is full - you have to go through the 3yr old area to get to it and it attracts older kids.

All in all as good as could be expected for the busy ness of the place",July 2016,Runaround play & party centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186364-d10256051-Reviews-Runaround_play_party_centre-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Perfect,"Christina and Spiros are good family people. They work hard and keep the studios lovely and clean. Rooms are typical Greek but well stocked. Good fridge. TV. Air Conditioning. We were by the pool and had a lemon tree outside our balcony. Breakfasts are simple with a small variation on eggs / meat but plenty to eat and a beautiful dining area. Or you can take your tray round the pool.
Lovely bar area with big TV
Supermarket next door but one. Bakery across the road. Fantastic restaurant next to Bakery (Costas)
If you eat at Costas you will walk back past 2 ginger cats. The sit in and around the rubbish bins. They love a bit of left over meat
We were made very welcome, Christina speaks the best English. Spiros will make himself understood.
We never revisit the same place twice but are seriously considering returning.",June 2016,Christina Studios,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1190188-d315141-Reviews-Christina_Studios-Lygia_Lefkada_Ionian_Islands.html,"Lefkada, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Average for Greece,"The setting for this restaurant is lovely looking out onto the water. The food is relatively good however we were spoiled by an excellent restaurant across from our accommodation which more than made up for the view.
We did feel rushed and got the impression they wanted to get more people through - I have to say unusual for Greek people",June 2016,Seven Islands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1190188-d1829766-Reviews-Seven_Islands-Lygia_Lefkada_Ionian_Islands.html,"Lefkada, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Nice food,"It was a halfway place too meet with friends from North Yorkshire. Coffee first was unremarkable. Lunch menu had some different choices. Prices were reasonably average for this type of place. Service was friendly and efficient
The pulled lamb in pitta was delicious. We didn't have room for dessert but the afternoon teas looked very nice",March 2016,Tankersley Manor Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g528796-d249193-Reviews-Tankersley_Manor_Hotel-Tankersley_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Tankersley, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,3.5
