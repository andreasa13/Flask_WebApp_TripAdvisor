Graduation Party for 12,"We did a small lunch party at the midtown Crave for 12 family and the service and food were excellent. We had oysters, ceviche, branzino, and several other dishes. All were excellent but the ceviche was special. The upstairs space was perfect for our gathering and the restaurant is easy to find. Highly recommend!",May 2019,Crave Fishbar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d3459256-Reviews-Crave_Fishbar-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Combo ticket tour,"This is it folks, the sights you came all this way to see. If you see the short films at The Acropolis museum before you come here, you will understand better what you are seeing in terms of the history and planned restoration of these amazing temples. Especially enlightening is the description of how most of the damage to the Parthenon was purposely caused by humans and not by natural forces. In any case, this is a place worth visiting as pictures and videos just don’t do it justice. Take your time and walk around the Erechtheion several times and each time you will see more detail. Be prepared for the long walk up the steep path to the Propylaea (and don’t slip on the exposed marble). Take your time and rest along the way if you need to; there’s plenty to see. When you come down and exit, bear to the right and go to the ancient Agora. It’s well worth seeing.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Excellent seafood, good value",We stayed in an airbnb on Rue de Rivoli and were hoping to find a nearby seafood restaurant when we found this gem a few short blocks away. Definitely not a tourist spot this place is well known to local seafood lovers. The shellfish platters seem to be the specialty here and they are really something to see. We were looking for fresh oysters and fish dinners and were not disappointed as we took the advice of our well informed waiter. The oysters were excellent and the bass and salmon dinners were simply cooked and very fresh. I would definitely visit the place again the next time I am in Paris.,January 2018,Le Comptoir des Mers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d2010582-Reviews-Le_Comptoir_des_Mers-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,4.0
better than the Louvre,"If you must see the Mona Lisa than you need to visit the Louvre, but if you want to be really thrilled by an amazing collection of wonderful art you must visit the Musee d'Orsay. The my wife and I were in Paris for our honeymoon 39 years ago, this museum was a defunct railway station. But today it is one of the most modern, well presented museum in Europe. By well presented I mean that the collection is logically organized, the paintings are well lit, the audio tour is extremely interesting and the entire museum is a good size for a three hour visit. We also had a very nice lunch at the cafe. So if you are interested in seeing great works by Renoir, Manet, Monet, Pissaro, Van Gogh and other great painters from the impressionist and pre and post impressionist movements, do not miss this museum.",January 2018,Musée d'Orsay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188150-Reviews-Musee_d_Orsay-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nothing like this in the USA,"Right across the street from our airbnb on Rue de Rivoli was a wonderful fruit shop, two wine shops, a patisserie and this gem of a cheese shop. Visit this place if for no other reason than to taste the samples on offer. Check out the variety of bleu cheeses. I am now totally in love with the cave aged gouda. Just don't ask for crackers (we were politely told the cheese and crackers are an American thing). The selection here is better than even the best high end supermarkets in the USA. Only in the Italian market in Phillie was I ever in a cheese heaven like Laurent Dubois.",January 2018,Fromagerie Laurent Dubois,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d2173596-Reviews-Fromagerie_Laurent_Dubois-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
The place for absinthe and mousse,"This place is a real trip to a different time and Parisian culture. Order a liquor drink after your meal and they bring over a device to drip ice water onto an ice cube suspended over your drink. Then order the mousse for dessert and expect a tankard that can easily serve eight people. Perhaps this is how they attract the tourists, but its still pretty special. We just had drinks and dessert but this place was a lot of fun as was our waiter, who made us all laugh.",January 2018,Chez Janou,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d714966-Reviews-Chez_Janou-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Nice Surprise on 9th Ave,"Confusingly there are two tripadvisor listings for this little gem and one of them has an out of date phone number. After reaching the restaurant on the second try I made a reservation for four this past Saturday night, pre-theater. Apparently the person who took the reservation doesn't usually answer the phone and when we arrived there was a little confusion but the staff did everything they could to make up for that. Our waiter turned out to be the one who I spoke to on the phone and he was wonderful, working hard to make up for his mistake even though it was really no big deal; we had a very nice table away from the noise and the front door. Our food was the next happy surprise. My branzini fish was excellent, a whole boned fish broiled perfectly with delicious sides. My friends all got the steak with onions and everyone was very pleased. The ""family style"" rice and beans was an excellent bonus. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a pre-theater meal at a reasonable price and food that is something you don't have every day.",January 2017,Samba Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d10781002-Reviews-Samba_Kitchen-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Happy to Have Been Visiting Cara Mia for Years,"Twenty years ago I popped into Cara Mia with my two teenage kids to get out of the rain knowing nothing about it. We were hungry and wet and the lunch specials were appealing. That lunch was the beginning of a long relationship with Cara Mia. We have had family birthday parties with twelve people, small pre-theatre dinners with my wife and I and everything between. Over the years the food and the service have been consistently excellent. I particularly like the striped bass, the eggplant parm and the pear and arugula salad. Be sure to make a reservation if you are pre-theater on the weekend as the place can get crowded.",January 2017,Cara Mia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d459072-Reviews-Cara_Mia-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.0
A few steps from the beaten path and worth it.,"We had a great time and a wonderful meal at this hidden gem of a bar and restaurant. The waiter was friendly, enthusiastic and extremely helpful making sure we knew the best grilled fish to order for our family group of five. We had the assorted meats and the tomato appetizers that were great starters and the hake and corvina grilled fish which were exceptional. The wines are very reasonable and a nice selection. The owner, who was behind the bar all night, was very nice to us. We were in a small room above the bar and it was not too noisy so that we could enjoy our conversation. We are very glad that we found this place before we left for Lisbon.",December 2016,Jota Batela,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d1674803-Reviews-Jota_Batela-Madrid.html,"Madrid, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Tired and hungry after the palace, then we stumbled on this wonderful place by chance","It was New Years Eve and places were closing all around. When we tried the door to El Buey and it was open we breathed a sigh of relief. I know the waiter was probably thinking about going home for the holiday but he did not let us think any such thing. He told us how we should order the specialty of the house and he was spot on. The specialty is a filet steak served seared but essentially raw and then they bring out heated ceramic ""plates"" and you cook each slice to your personal liking. Maybe lots of restaurants do this in Spain but it was new to us, and seemed quite wonderful. The meat was tender and delicious. Oh yes, we also had appetizers. The first thing the waiter brought was a bowl of meatballs in sauce with some delicious bread. We were hungry and the meatballs disappeared quickly. The we ordered grilled mushrooms that were out of this world. The generous order was plenty for the five of us. We also had a very fine ratatoule that we all enjoyed. And then the meat. What a wonderful surprise this place was.",December 2016,Buey Bistró,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d697527-Reviews-Buey_Bistro-Madrid.html,"Madrid, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.0

This is the Best of the Best,Everything about the Tarrytown House Estate is wonderful. The staff is professional and welcoming. The rooms are beautiful and clean.

Outstanding,"I love this estate. I'm in the area often for business purposes. I've stayed in several area hotels, and this is by far the best. It's a beautiful place! The service, however, is really what makes this hotel superior to other hotels in the area. The staff went out of their way to make my stay perfect.
