Stacie & Sonny,"My Boss was here about 6 months ago and gave us Giannis’s phone number because he was so friendly and efficient. We’re so glad we called him. He was even a bit early each time to pick us up! He was even happily willing to pick us up at 4 am to take us back to the airport. We had to take a cab with someone else when we were sightseeing in Corinth and I was scared to death! That guy did not drive like Giannis!! Giannis drives the speed limit and obeys the rules :-). Giannis is very knowledgeable on the area of Athens since he’s lived here his entire life and gave ya great suggestions on where to eat, sights to see, etc. He comes highly recommended!!!
