Beautiful Hotel Close to Town,"If you are ever in Santorini, THIS is the hotel that you want to stay in. Everything from the staff to the rooms themselves were great. The colors in the room give you a vacation vibe and the rooms are very spacious. The private balcony was an extra touch if you wanted to sit outside and watch the sunset. The view was AMAZING. The staff were also very helpful. The hotel was about a 10 minute walk from Fira city center which wasn't bad at all. There was a bus stop right outside of the hotel in case you wanted to catch the bus to other places outside of Fira. One of my favorite hotels during my stay in Greece.",October 2019,The Majestic Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d579615-Reviews-The_Majestic_Hotel-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great Follow Up to Acropolis Visit!,This is a great complement to a visit to the Acropolis. The museum was about a 15 minute walk from the site and we used the same entry ticket for the site visit for the museum (not sure if all of the tickets are like this as I went on a group trip). The museum visit was a chance to see some of the original pieces from the Acropolis along with replicas. A must see in Athens.,October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A- MAZING!,I remember learning about Athens and the Acropolis in history class in middle and high school and never imagined that I would see it in person. I am so glad I had the opportunity to do so. It was worth the crowds and the walk to get there. To be standing on such a historical site and learning as much as I did was unbelievable. This is a first stop MUST see when you touch down in Athens.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"The name grabs you, but the food makes you want to come back..","Before visiting Seattle, I researched and came across this place as one of the top places to grab breakfast in Seattle. And with a name like this who could resist. I already knew the line was going to be long and it was, but to me it was worth the wait. I had the biscuit with sausage...SMOTHERED in sausage gravy. From the first bite until the last I enjoyed it. The vibe in the restaurant is great, the people who work behind the counter are very personable and although the wait for food was about 45 minutes, I didn't mind at all.",June 2017,Biscuit Bitch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60878-d10680149-Reviews-Biscuit_Bitch-Seattle_Washington.html,"Seattle, Washington",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice hotel...good location,"Despite some remodeling going on, the hotel is very nice. The staff greeted us with a smile when we walked in and they were very cordial and helpful with any questions that we had. Our room was nice - we were upgraded to a suite. The furniture in the living area was a little dated, but suitable. The bed was very comfortable and they had enough pillows for me to bury myself in while I slept. Bathroom was very nice - the double sink was a plus. The location of the hotel was wonderful. I was surprised that we were so close to the Space Needle and Seattle Center - about a 10 minute walk. That also connected us to the monorail which made it easy for use to get to Westlake Center, Pike's Place Market and the waterfront without having to deal with traffic. We did eat at the hotel's restaurant the first night and the food and the service were great as well. When I visit Seattle again I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",June 2017,Four Points by Sheraton Downtown Seattle Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60878-d124264-Reviews-Four_Points_by_Sheraton_Downtown_Seattle_Center-Seattle_Washington.html,"Seattle, Washington",hotels,4.0,4.0
Impressed Visiting Baltimore Oriole's Fan,"I was visiting Seattle and had the opportunity to go to a Seattle Mariner's game (they were playing the Houston Astros), Coming from Oriole Park at Camden Yards, I was definitely wondering what my experience was going to be like and I was impressed. I was sitting very high up, but my views of the field were great. The energy in the stadium was definitely very high - the fans definitely show out for their team. The food prices were typical for a ballpark so I didn't mind spending here. I wouldn't call myself a Mariner's fan, but I enjoyed my experience at Safeco.",June 2017,T-Mobile Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60878-d531952-Reviews-T_Mobile_Park-Seattle_Washington.html,"Seattle, Washington",attractions,4.0,4.5
FINALLY!!!!,"I am a fan of tall structures (skyscrapers being a fascination) and the Space Needle has been on my list of places that I've wanted to go FOREVER. I got the chance to visit Seattle and the FIRST place I went was here. The ticket price was lower than I expected and I like the fact that they broke up the visitors into time slots so that there weren't huge crowds at one time. The views were PHENOMINAL. The weather was nice and it was so clear that I was able to see Mt. Rainier, Puget Sound and Elliott Bay, any and everything! I took so many pictures. I could have stayed there all day. This is a must go to if you visit Seattle.",June 2017,Space Needle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60878-d123109-Reviews-Space_Needle-Seattle_Washington.html,"Seattle, Washington",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Views!!,Reasonable ticket price and you stay on the wheel for at least 10 minutes. Just hold your breath if you stop at the top or over the water..LOL. The views were absolutely great. Make sure you have your camera ready. Once you get off the wheel you can head inside Miner's Landing and grab some food!,June 2017,Seattle Great Wheel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60878-d3308043-Reviews-Seattle_Great_Wheel-Seattle_Washington.html,"Seattle, Washington",attractions,5.0,4.0
Loved it....,"After a morning of sightseeing all over Seattle, I was definitely ready to sit down and have some Pacific Northwest seafood. Coming from Maryland (Baltimore specifically) - the home of some of the best seafood, I was skeptical. I wasn't disappointed. The calamari was very tasty and not overdone. I had the crab, shrimp, corn and red potatoes. When I tell you I was FULL after I was done - yes I ate it all - I was full and very satisfied. Crab legs were meaty, shrimp were a nice size, corn and potatoes cooked perfectly. Our server was very attentive and answered my questions about the menu perfectly.",June 2017,The Crab Pot Seafood Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60878-d479890-Reviews-The_Crab_Pot_Seafood_Restaurant-Seattle_Washington.html,"Seattle, Washington",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great Food...Great Music,"I went to see Poncho Sanchez and his band perform and everything about the night was great. Made reservations online and because we were having dinner, we were advised to get there at least and hour to an hour and a half ahead of time - that would give us time to enjoy our meal before the show. The meal was great - nice portions, great taste. We decided on floor seats and they were great. I honestly don't think there was a bad seat in the house and I was a little jealous of the people sitting in the balcony..lol. Be advised that if you are just going for the show (and not dinner), those who are having dinner will have priority in being seated.",June 2017,Dimitriou's Jazz Alley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60878-d103583-Reviews-Dimitriou_s_Jazz_Alley-Seattle_Washington.html,"Seattle, Washington",attractions,5.0,4.5
Most Amazing thing Ever!,"I went to Niagara Falls two weeks ago and I was already amazed at the beauty of the falls. I kept saying ""Nature at its finest"": or ""This is so beautiful"". My friend and I decided to do the Journey Behind the Falls and I was floored - in a good way. The views from below and behind the falls were breathtaking. It didn't matter to me that it was raining and windy. I was out on the observation deck trying to get as many pictures as I can Seeing one of nature's great creations that close up was mind blowing. When we went to the two portals and got to see sheets or water pouring down, I just stood there with my mouth wide open.The experience was great, we didn't have to wait a long time, and the people were spaced out enough between the observation decks and the portals that no one was falling over the next person. I would definitely do this again!",April 2017,Journey Behind the Falls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154998-d286825-Reviews-Journey_Behind_the_Falls-Niagara_Falls_Ontario.html,"Niagara Falls, Canada",attractions,5.0,4.0
Very nice hotel!,Not to long of a drive from Toronto and right near the QEW and the outlets. The room was nice and the hotel staff was very friendly. Only about 15 minutes from Niagara Falls and the drive to their from the hotel was very scenic and nice.

Good food,I was really surprised by the portions. There were only two of us and we could barely get through half of each plate. I was definitely full and satisfied when I left.,April 2017,New Ho King Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d707291-Reviews-New_Ho_King_Restaurant-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Toronto, Canada",restaurants,4.0,3.0
The Perfect Island,"Sandy Island was nothing short of BEAUTIFUL! If you want a nice day trip where you can get great food and take a dip in beautiful water, Sandy Island is where you want to go! It's small enough that a walk around the island would probably take about 15 minutes (depending on how fast you walk..lol), but big enough that you and 160 other people can take over and have the best time ever! If you are ever in Anguilla, please put Sandy Island on your to-do list!",May 2014,Sandy Island Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g5213296-d1021339-Reviews-Sandy_Island_Restaurant-Sandy_Ground_Anguilla.html,Anguilla,restaurants,5.0,4.0
Nice hotel,"I had done some research because this was going to be the first time that I actually stayed in a hotel on a visit to NYC. I had gone back and forth between this hotel and the Sheraton next door, and after talking to my sister, I decided to stay at the Aloft. I liked the fact that it was on a side street, but not to far from the main street. The subway at Hoyt Street was a block away so that made it easy for me to get to Manhattan with no problem. When I got my room key, I went up to the room only to find that the room had not been cleaned. I immediately went back downstairs and advised the person at the desk the condition of the room and was immediately given a new room. Went up to the new room and LOVED it. I was on the 23rd floor and my view was great! I loved the decor and how they used the space. The bed was comfortable, I had no complaints. I am going to be back in NYC the middle of January and will be making my reservation at the Aloft.",October 2013,Aloft New York Brooklyn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60827-d1174685-Reviews-Aloft_New_York_Brooklyn-Brooklyn_New_York.html,"Brooklyn, New York",hotels,4.0,4.0
