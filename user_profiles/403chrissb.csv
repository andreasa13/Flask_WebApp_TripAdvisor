Consistently good hotel,"The interior of this hotel is beautiful with hanging chandeliers and Arabic mashrabia throughout. It is perfectly situated on the edge of town and next door to the ibn Battuta mall. The hotel staff are friendly, rooms are good and there are some very fine restaurants especially the Chinese one. Very family oriented and they take great care of your kids here. We have been coming here for years and it has never dropped standards. For the price you pay here it is a very good value Dubai hotel and they now have a sister on the palm and they will transport you over to sit by the sea for a day
Consistently good",August 2017,Oaks Ibn Battuta Gate Dubai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d1823675-Reviews-Oaks_Ibn_Battuta_Gate_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,4.5
Brilliant at this time of year!,"It must be 3 or 4 years since I last came here and I spotted a big pink swathe in the water from the car the other day and thought it must be flamingoes so we went round first thing in the morning and we were amazed at the amount and variety of birds there. A local bird watcher gave us the insight on some of the birds but apart from the pink and white flamingoes there were cranes and storks and a variety of herons and egrets of different size and color
They still close this place on Friday’s which I seriously do not understand but if you get the chance to take a look during the cooler months, it is well worth a visit",December 2019,Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d1959617-Reviews-Ras_Al_Khor_Wildlife_Sanctuary-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,4.0,4.0
Reliable good food,"This franchise continues to deliver quality food and our meal was no exception. The staff were fast and friendly and the truffle risotto was top class. My friends had the cheesecake and it all looked very yummy
But........
Unfortunately we sat outside on the terrace and we were plagued with flies and inspects something terrible so if you are visiting here sit inside.",December 2019,Jones the Grocer - Dubai Mall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d16853319-Reviews-Jones_the_Grocer_Dubai_Mall-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Top class Chinese food!,"Excellent restaurant! The menu is extensive and the dishes are authentic. I took a team of ten here for Xmas works lunch and the speed and quality of the service was impressive. The food was wonderful and every morsel was consumed. The starters and dim sum alone are massive meals but the specials were all yummy too. The team were stuffed!
Big shout to little Brenda who served our table with grace and a smile and constantly asked us how she could help us. Thanks!

World class stadium,"A positive jewel in the already shining crown of singapore, this place is an excellent venue. We went for the U2 concert and we were advised to come early and glad we did! Travel on the metro is simplicity and the signs to the various entrance gates and ticket entry points are clear and you cannot get lost. When you emerge from the metro at the stadium you arrive in an entertainment town with cafes and bars in full swing. You can get any type of drink and food desired and because there are so many outlets you do not have queue for most of the day like you do in other stadiums. People were sat everywhere on the walls and stairs just eating and drinking and feeling good before the concert. Loads of toilets and everything way signed clearly enough but plenty of Marshall’s and security staff walking around who are mor than willing to direct or assist you.
No cattle market corralling of humanity here, this stadium is open, free and full of happy people

Interesting experience,"Interesting
There’s are no animals or birds here like the rainforest in Dubai so you are going to look at flowers. Having said that, they are spectacular especially the orchid walk and the fly traps.

Excellent seafood! - Famous chili crab,"You can sit on a plastic stool in the street and get the authentic singapore chili crab experience but if you want to eat in a restaurant surrounding then Jumbo is the best place.
We had the medium mud crab - chili crab set lunch with white rice and some Chinese greens. The food was simply amazing.
The chili crab takes 40 minutes and there is always a queue so we booked a table as soon as we had checked in our bags in the Jewel. Drinks are extra from the set menu so the whole thing was a bit pricey by comparison to the street but the setting, the service and quality of food were well worth it.you cannot come to singapore without trying the award winning chili crab experience and this is as good as anywhere to enjoy it.",December 2019,Jumbo Seafood (Jewel Changi Aiport),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d17345978-Reviews-Jumbo_Seafood_Jewel_Changi_Aiport-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fantastic airport experience like no other,"Singapore airport is like no other. There are two central hubs, the duty free zone after you pass immigration exit and this place which is on the outside between terminals 1 & 3.
Come early, check in your bags here and spend time roaming around. It’s like a day out before your flight.
The water fall feature is impressive and up on the top deck you can buy pass tickets too all the attractions and visit the rope bridge the steam forest the mirror hall and so on. There is a decent size mall and a very good food terrace area with every type of restaurant and bar, coffee shop and the ubiquitous ice cream shakes.
We had 5 hours between hotel check out and flight boarding and we passed 3 of them easily here just milling around and having lunch.
It is well worth coming early and seeing any least some of this wonderful place as there is no other airport i have ever been to as interesting as this one.",December 2019,Jewel Changi Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294265-d17237163-Reviews-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",attractions,5.0,4.5
worth the experience,"Note: this is not HOPON-HOPOFF so choose your destination wisely.
We went from Marina bay sands all the way up the canal and back again to the Merlion. This is the best value tour for your money. The view from the boat when you get onto the canal is very good, you go past clarke quay and the colonial offices, etc and the television tour guide is very informative describing what you can see from every angle.
If you are staying in Singapore for a few days it is worth doing this boat trip early so that you can see some of the park and bar areas you might want to walk through later.
Boats are slow, safe and clean and this is a trip worth taking",December 2019,Singapore River Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294265-d6692280-Reviews-Singapore_River_Cruise-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",attractions,3.0,4.0
Top quality Chinese fine dining,"Set in the main lobby corridor of the hotel, this is an excellent Chinese restaurant. Quick, friendly and efficient staff ease you through the experience and you can order from schezwan, Beijing, shanghai, hong Kong as well as an extensive range of seafoods done china style. There is plenty of drinks on the menu and you can go the whole hog with authentic Chinese mao tai wine if you want to experience it (don’t!).
A little pricy compared to the abundant Chinese food available in singapore as a fine dining experience it is very good

Excellent lobby lounge,"This is a Japanese themed bar with a large selection of sake as well as an extensive whisky range. They have home made craft beer which is very good. The food is arty snacks and small meals and all of it worth while. The staff are excellent as they are everywhere in this hotel, service is swift and always with a smiling face. Before dinner drinks or a chance to catch up on some emails over a glass of wine, this is a very pleasant place to sit for a while and relax (especially good for a pint when it takes your wife umpty million man hours to fix her makeup!)",December 2019,Renku Bar & Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d12895727-Reviews-Renku_Bar_Lounge-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,5.0,4.5
extraordinary bar - well worth a visit!,"In a strange combination, this place advertises “gourmet burger”, “craft beers”, “luxury shakes”
It is exactly what you get.
The beer selection is extensive. I tried two different draft ales recommended by the staff and they were both good.
Not a fan of burgers per se but i had the Mexican chili burger and it was fabulous . The wife had a bespoke wage and special cheese thing and she could only finish half. Real chops and fresh salads with every meal.
Singapore loves Sundaes and milk shakes and this place is the best in town for them. Too full to try one, we just watched as great swathes of local girls tucked into giant ice cream sundaes with sauces and toppings and edible swizzle sticks - you name it? The queue at the weekend is testament to how popular this bar is and it appeals to every type of person.
A really very interesting bar, burger joint, ice cream parlor concept restaurant well worth a visit!",December 2019,Black Tap - Singapore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d15070760-Reviews-Black_Tap_Singapore-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Best bar in Singapore!,"We came across this place the night we watched the light and fountain show. It is the best bar we visited in Singapore. The food was exceptional, a blend of Asian and Italian was on offer and everything looked marvelous. We had pizza and salad to share and it was top quality.
The wine menu is massive as is the cocktail list. If you are thirsty you can order a “tower of beer” that comes with chilled glasses which they plonk on your table and you serve yourself.
As with every where, it is the staff that makes a place and this bar was operated by a dozen local girls none of which were taller than 5ft but all of whom worked theirs socks off delivering food and drink rapidly with a smile. The manager cam to our table twice to make sure everything was good and we stayed much longer than we had intended to just because it was so good.

Small but good bar,"Extensive wine menu and the biggest selection of bourbon i have seen anywhere. It is a small bar, we never tried the food but for a drink stop off it was fine.

New location with “photo opportunity” platform,"Check out the interesting history of how singapore got its name and what the Merlion means to them.
This is a “must do” photo opportunity, you simply have to have your picture taken here if you visit Singapore. There’s not much nearby, a few cafes etc. but it is only a short walk or a quick ride on the bum boats to Clarke quay so its worth stopping off here for that photo opportunity, especially the shot where you stand with your mouth open and get the right angle so you picture appears that you are drinking from the fountain.

For the younger ones,"We went early evening after dark after an afternoon swimming in the infinity pool but there was several problems. All the view seats at the edge of the bar were reserved for fee paying customers. 500 Sing dollars to sit down is just ridiculous. This meant that in a roof top bar at the top of a sky scraper you could not see the view. Next, the music was too loud. The waitresses were struggling to hear us.
So...... we stood in the defending dark and drank one drink then left
No idea what the food was like or what the place is like during the day but clearly the night I needed is for young people with money to burn and no interest in talking to each other",December 2019,CÉ LA VI,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d1937704-Reviews-CE_LA_VI-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Fine dining in the sky,"We had already visited the main section of this restaurant during our trip to the infinity pool so we booked a table at night for the full dining experience. There’s a dress code and limited availability so best to prepare.
The cocktails were great and came quickly or could be blended at your table. The wine menu was staggering!
The chef came and made his recommendations and we ordered based on what he told us rather than the menu. Needless to say, the food was amazing. The staff were lovely and dedicated to only a few tables so you never needed to wait for anything.

Two tiny complaints:
1) the background music was rock hits of the 70”s and the full length version of “don’t fear the reaper” is hardly conducive to a relaxed dining experience
2) the unisex toilet door did not lock and someone opened it while my wife was in there (fortunately another woman)",December 2019,Spago Dining Room by Wolfgang Puck,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d8683187-Reviews-Spago_Dining_Room_by_Wolfgang_Puck-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Small but worth the visit,"By day it is a fairly simple Chinese market selling the usual tourist tat. But come here at night and it transforms! Once the cooking stations get going and the place is viewed with all the neon lights etc. its like visiting old world china.
There’s a very unusual temple that’s worth a visit. A Chinese cultural heritage center also worth calling in and across the road there is an indoor food court if it starts raining.

Thank you Gordon!,"What you expect from Gordon Ramsey, the place is lovely and right on the weathers edge at the Marina. Loads of place to sit outside, an extensive wine and cocktail menu and seriously reliable UK grub cooked and served well. We went twice, breakfast one day on the way out touring and drinks and dinner one night on the way back to the hotel. Food was excellent both time and the service was great.

Like the Maldives on a roof!,"Beautiful place. If you are a hotel guest access is free. There is a nightclub terrace bar on Tower 3 and a large Italian bar and grill on top of tower 1 in between them there is a giant infinity pool. There are loads of seats and beds in a variety of options, there are jacuzzi pools and observation seats. The pool is huge and split into family zone and adults only. There is an abundance of staff bringing drinks and food to you. In the main concourse area there is a large bar and diner by Wolfgang Puck and you can sit and dine in the main area or the bar anytime.
Above all (excuse the pun!)
To swim to the waters edge and look down 55 stores to the marina below is an experience not to missed. H a cocktail in hand and look down on the forest and gardens behind the hotel is just wonderful.
As with everywhere you go in this hotel, the staff are great. Lots of friendly people more than happy to go the extra mile to make you happy and comfortable

Spectacular,"“Gardens” does not do this place justice. It is 100 hectares of lush tropical forest with walkways and water features. There are play parks for kids and designated picnic areas but the main event is the pay to enter attractions namely the misty mountain and floral garden both of which are a must see and worth the entrance fee. In the mountain walk you can see meat eating plants and walk through a corridor of orchids. There a huge waterfall and tropical plants and trees from all around the world. Inside, it is a riot of colors and smells wonderful.
In the floral gardens they already had a Christmas theme set up so you can walk through pine trees to Santa’s cabin and all the rest of it. Needles to say, it wears packed full of super happy kids!
Inside or out (even in the rain!), this is a beautifully maintained well laid out forest-garden-park walk.
A must see.
Tip: the giant steel flowers. Walk (climb). Them only if you are fit and active as it is a tiring climb just to see the trees from above but most importantly. Time your visit here so that you can see these trees at night. The subtle light show is truly lovely and you cannot come to singapore and miss this night time attraction",December 2019,Gardens by the Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294265-d2149128-Reviews-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",attractions,4.0,4.5
Fantastic Hotel,"Where to start with this leviathan of a hotel? Three towers, around 20 Resturants, an a gazillion things to do! This is one of the best hotels i ever stayed in. Off course the people make the place and here in MBS there is an eclectic bunch of super-friendly and helpful staff to make your stay the best it possibly can be. With 6 celebrity restaurants, bars and cafes everywhere and the worlds biggest roof top infinity pool, plus the giant mall, the laser fountain, science museum, theatre and casino, you could spend your entire holiday in singapore just in this hotel
Tip 1: get a “City view” room. You can see the fountain show and the canal boats and the city skyline is breathtaking.
Tip 2: this hotel is vast. If you are going to meander around the mall you take the main tunnel exit between tower 1 and 2 but... if you are heading straight for the waterline to the restaurants or the fountain show then exit the building and go up the elevator to the bridge. It brings you out at the waters edge exit doors and it saves masses of walking if your not interested in shopping.

Great location, great amenities and loads of restaurants and staffed with smiling happy people. This hotel ticks all the boxes

Avoid the Friday Brunch!,"Although the setting is beautiful, this Friday brunch was ruined by the staff (or lack off!) .
The lunch is Japanese based but actually only consists of Sushi plus 1 main course which is simply not worth the cost but to add to the dissapointment, the staff were useless. Inattentive, often absent and looking as if we had disturbed their valuable time when we finally managed to attract their attention

The best Friday brunch in Dubai,"Simply fantastic!
This place has maintained its rightful position as best brunch in Dubai by continually providing the very best of quality. It is impossible to list or recommend dishes there are simply too many but suffice to say that the food here is second to none
A light jazz trio, smiling helpful staff, sunlight sparkling off the boats in the marina, it is the most relaxing ambient fur a Friday brunch. They also hold the best cheese room I have ever seen.
Over the years, I have had several birthdays here and I am so glad we returned this week

The staff are eclectic and everyone seems to enjoy working here. The food is a select menu but plenty of it arrives and it was all quality. The drinks menu was comprehensive and there is a follow on after party if you want to take the mood further.
If you live in Dubai it is certainly a brunch experience to add to your list

There was not a lot of people here it being mid summer so there was plenty of attentive staff. The seating area is in a big glass atrium so i feels very spacious and airy. The prices for the inclusive alcohol package were very competitive and for what we paid compared to what we got, we felt we had a very good deal.
Relaxing and charming, good food, good staff and cheap what more can you ask for?

First class venue,"I have been here at night to watch a rock band and it is as good a venue as any i have visited in the world but this Hard Rock Cafe particularly excels during the day and especially on Fridays. Everything is as you would expect with bright colorful happy staff singing along to the tunes and delivering the famous menu choices with aplomb (my favorites are the beef short ribs - yum!). But HRC really shines for families during the day time hours. The meals selections please even the pickiest kid but the shakes, floats and mocktails delight them! When i was here on Friday afternoon there was bikers in leather sat next to family groups and later in the afternoon after Friday Prayers were completed, locals started to come in with their families. The sight of local people in their traditional dress in large family groups sat at the next table from leather clad biker s quaffing pints on a Friday afternoon shows you the truly eclectic appeal of the Hard Rock Cafe and says a lot about how good it is to be living in Dubai.

Authentic Arabic,"There are many coffee shops everywhere where you can pick up a flat white and blueberry muffin but the Cafe Bateel franchise offer a touch of Arabic class. There’s an extensive menu and they always try for a relaxing atmosphere. This one in Festival city i have visited several times, they have select menus where you can get Arabic coffee and dates or go for a straight black americano if you prefer. If you are gonna relax for half an hour during your shopping then Cafe Bateel is a touch above your average coffee shop and worth a visit",July 2019,Cafe Bateel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d3918698-Reviews-Cafe_Bateel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Top quality Friday brunch!,"Scrumptious and excellent food including (if you pay for it) the champagne and caviar package. The fresh seafood was excellent with chefs on hand to help you out or prepare to your taste. The waitresses bring you shots, cocktails and even alcoholic ice creams! There is an Italian station cooking pizza and their truffle risotto cannot be missed. Wide open and bright with all the windows plus the view of the Dubai lake and fountain, the life is a top class restaurant that does a top class brunch but as with anywhere, it is the people that make the venue and the the loft Friday brunch was full of helpful happy staff, quick to assist and hand out smiles
I went home wobbly and full of caviar after a very pleasant Friday afternoon

Great steakhouse!,"What it says on the door. They have a great big grill pit and they know how to use it! They have an extensive wine menu and there’s a well stocked bar but it’s the steak you come here for. The special was 600g t-bone and even I could not finish it. The decor is beautiful, the theme is Argentinian and menu reflects that, the fried crab starter was delicious, the wife had a hearty soup which almost finished her so we had to take her seafood platter home.
Good food, good setting, good staff

Abysmal service!,"Thursday night, the week finished and time for a relaxing seat on the veranda and happy hour. No.
The staff were truly the worst I have seen anywhere, unmanaged and left to themselves they were in disarray, orders were cancelled or lost, people were vociferously complaining and food was arriving to tables that had been abandoned.

The Habtor polo club is a truly lovely place with its isolated position giving it a monopoly on the local area but we will travel far and wide to avoid the chaos of this bar,
they seriously need to understand what customer service is",May 2019,Horse & Hound,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d15003189-Reviews-Horse_Hound-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Hearty American fare!,"You can tell by the steaks on show in the cooler as you enter that this place takes its food seriously. The menu is vast with steaks, ribs, fish and chicken dishes. There is a selection of American staples including chili, corn bread and sauce, fried chicken etc. they have a selection of mocktails but no bar.
The staff are plentiful and friendly, the portions are huge and the food is super yummy

Constantly excellent,"I have never eaten here and the late night DJ affairs are not for me but in the early evening on those big sofas sipping cocktails in the dark moody atmosphere of Karma Kafe is a super relaxing experience. The cocktail and drinks menu is extensive, the staff are great and it’s very relaxing place to be (until it gets full then I leave!).
You can sit outside on the terrace, have your dinner and watch the fountain if you book early.
I have been coming here years now and the standards have never slipped. I nice, moody, relaxing cocktail bar very close to the Dubai Mall, open afternoons and well worth a visit any day",April 2019,Karma Kafé,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d1587253-Reviews-Karma_Kafe-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,4.0,4.0
A much improved pub,"Have not been here for a long time I cannot really remember why I stopped coming here but we were out with friends and stopped here for drinks and it was a pleasant experience. A large but fairly standard American themed sports bar but there was an abundance of friendly staff, a very good pub menu specially the sharing platters. Drinks come in novelty jam jars and if the weather is good you can sit outside on the terrace. The locality of a decent pub close to the Dubai Mall is worth keeping in mind for those lengthy shopping days when the wife is stuck in Jimmy Choo’s!

Bland and basic,"Looked forward a large business function at this hotel in the heart of downtown but it did not live up to expectations.

Firstly, valet parking were in disarray and did not seem prepared for a lot of people and it could only be described as chaos at departure time, cars with no drivers blocking the exit of people trying to leave etc.
Then, there’s no bar per se, There is a kind of add on bar to the coffee shop / smoking lounge but we got the impression that they wanted to sell cream cakes and teas
Then, the function itself was poorly attended by staff, everyone was trying to attract waiters and the staff looked hassled.

Not the usually standard for Address or indeed any of the Downtown hotels. We have had functions in the Manzil and the Palace hotels that were much better",April 2019,Address Boulevard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d10451046-Reviews-Address_Boulevard-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,5.0
Excellent spa,"We were booked for the couples experience as part of my wife’s birthday weekend. Unfortunately nature intervened and we could not attend. I write this piece as a thank you to staff. Normally there are late cancellation fees etc and things can be a bit of drama but when i went to speak to the staff here they could not be more helpful. They were disappointed on our behalf and showed us the facilities and made a note of our names for the next time we visit. The staff at the Talise spa like all the staff at Zabeel Saray are just wonderful.
We will certainly return and enjoy the experience one day",April 2019,Talise Ottoman Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d3374752-Reviews-Talise_Ottoman_Spa-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent for breakfast or brunch!,"We have been to Imperium before for the Friday brunch and were suitably impressed. Staying here for the weekend to celebrate my wife’s birthday meant That we visited here twice for breakfast. The breakfast buffet is vast and there are Arabic, Indian and Asian cooking stations as well as fresh eggs, fruit and drinks stations on top of the buffet spread. The staff as they are everywhere in Zabeel Saray are first class and there’s always someone bringing you mer coffee or whatever you need, they look after you. In this weather, breakfast out on the terrace is a must, its a beautiful garden setting with sparkling water features. They have a duty falconer outside and the site of his magnificent falcon gliding over head and all the sparrows and crows making a desperate run for the trees as it passes is a not to be missed breakfast bonus!

Stunning romantic beach dinner,"By day, Plaj is the beach bar and restaurant. Located next to the pool and convenient for beach, pool, toilets, showers etc. The staff of plaj wander all around the beach and poolside areas delivering snacks and drinks to your seats. The bar is spacious and the deck of the main restaurant is spacious for a proper sit down lunch. The menu is varied and there’s an extensive children’s menu plus lots of attentive staff to help you with the kids.
BUT
At night, once the pool and beach are closed, this place transforms itself to a moody beachside bar where you can listen to the gentle waves as you sip a cocktail or two.
We booked the romantic beach dinner for my wife’s birthday and it was everything they said it was in the sales pitch. The setting was superb, the food was superb, the service was superb. It wears the meal that defined our stay and the reason we chose Zabeel Saray and they did not disappoint.
Thank you Plaj for a most memorable dinner evening.",April 2019,Plaj,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d3920218-Reviews-Plaj-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fantastic food!,"As the standard red wine and steak dinner is my favorite, i have been lucky enough to sample most of the top steak houses in dubai. The Rib Room at Zabeel Saray just shot right into my top five list. Dinner here for meat lovers is excellent. Some exotic starters on the menu, a massive wine list, a beautiful young lady playing gentle piano in the corner and simply wonderful steak. The staff are marvelous, helpful and friendly. Both our steaks were cooked exactly as we asked and the food was delightful.",April 2019,The Rib Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d7370342-Reviews-The_Rib_Room-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Simply Fantastic!,"This is a truly great hotel. The architecture is magnificent like an old Arabian palace. The gardens and pool area are resplendent and fragrant with colorful plants but it is the people that really make this hotel work. Zabeel Saray is one of those rare hotels where you get the feeling that everyone loves working here and that they are all happy and this is conveyed to the residents. Everywhere you go from valet parking to check out you are surrounded by people asking you if you are happy? Can they help you? Is there anything we can do for you? At Zabeel Saray you genuinely feel welcomed.
There are many restaurants as you would expect. Breakfast is a spectacular buffet and when you are on the beach there are plenty of happy staff bringing fresh towels, ice creams and waiter services to your recliner. All you have to do at Zabeel Saray is reflex and enjoy yourself, they do the rest

Just gets better and better,"I have been going to the meat company since it first opened and it is definitely my favorite restaurant in Dubai. The recent revamp has only improved it. The food is excellent it is a meat lovers paradise. The new floating tables add to the experience, there’s no better view of the tower lighting show and the fountain than here. Staff are fantastic! Everyone is smiling and happy. Steak and red wine, what more can you want
10 years and still getting better and better! Do not miss the chance to sit here for fine dining before it’s too hot to enjoy
