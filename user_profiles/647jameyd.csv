Take the time to learn about this incredible edifice.,Learning about something as magnificent as the Acropolis will broaden your understanding of the world around you.

Perfection at a reasonable price!,"After searching TripAdvisor for the best cruise at the best price with the best reviews we landed on this absolutely perfect experience. Our hotel recommended many other, much more expensive excursions. We ignored them and took this one instead. It is a great crew on a great boat with great food and music. Exactly what it’s supposed to be. And very affordable. Probably the only thing affordable to do on Santorini! Take the time to do business with these people. You deserve it and so do they.",July 2018,Bella Aurora & Thalassa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635864-d896859-Reviews-Bella_Aurora_Thalassa-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Pay the money , it’s worth it.","This find is a little jewel on Santorini. The view is insane! The staff and kitchen crew take care of you like family. The food is Phenomenal! The location is about perfectly situated in the middle of the island for easy transit north or south. Use the office personnel for setting up transfers! The bus system is mentioned in other reviews as a cheap and easy option. Do not put anyone you know on this bus unless you are the beneficiary on their life insurance policy. It is a mass casualty event waiting to happen. The cliffs are steep and these bus drivers act like they have nothing to live for. Do Not Take The BUS!! Ask for a transfer, it’s so easy and it’s very very reasonable. Your life is worth the $25 euros. Skip the Donkey ride torture. It’s torture for your back and theirs. Book it! JFDI. You won’t regret it. Trip of a lifetime, destination of a lifetime and hotel experience of a lifetime.",July 2018,Csky Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d1537476-Reviews-Csky_Hotel-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Love this place,We had the great pleasure of enjoying a meal here in mid March. Both my wife and I got steaks of course. They are always perfect and perfectly seasoned.

Perfect for a home base when stopping in Savannah,"The breakfast alone is worth staying at this hotel. Great service and excellent facilities.

Save your money,"So, this place is a well designed and beautifully appointed Japanese grill on the parkway in Pigeon Forge. I was Thrilled to see it was open and we pulled right it. We have a place in The Forge and visit often. We walked in, checked out the incredible menu and ordered. There were 2 couples in the place and exactly 2 employees. None of which were Asian. Someone dropped some serious money on building this place, and there is a white guy ( I am white ) on the grill and a brown guy at the counter. There is not a soul of Asian descent in the building. And you could tell when the food came , eventually. The meal was edible and we did not get sick, much to my surprise, and did not have any other issues the next day either. But, someone put some serious money into building this place out, and it is going to go out of business before they ever make a penny unless they make themselves present and participate in running this place.",January 2018,NAO Japanese Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55270-d12862345-Reviews-NAO_Japanese_Grill-Pigeon_Forge_Tennessee.html,"Pigeon Forge, Tennessee",restaurants,2.0,3.5

Underwhelming,"I have stopped into this Pancake house in the past and would have given it a good review previously. Idk what happened. Food is cheap, safe to eat but INCREDIBLY over priced.

"So much better than Disney , it not even funny","For those of you who have traveled to Disney's water parks , you will be pleasantly surprised by the quality and affordability of Splash Country.

A gem in the middle of chaos,"We have stayed at river stone 5 times. We did not stay this past visit because I waited too long to book it. Sometimes I am stupid like that.

"Needs help, really they actually need more help","Extremely well done resort. Great choice in building materials and over all the feel is that of luxury. Staff was nice and as helpful as possible. The main problem, hands down, is the abundance of managers and the like. While there is a huge lack of the people who actually do things , like cooks, servers and valet. This resort desperately needs someone who managed a resort in the past, to come in and help this great destination get on its feet. It feels like the potential is there, but right now it is not living up to it in any way.",August 2015,Dollywood's DreamMore Resort and Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55270-d7772465-Reviews-Dollywood_s_DreamMore_Resort_and_Spa-Pigeon_Forge_Tennessee.html,"Pigeon Forge, Tennessee",hotels,3.0,4.5
