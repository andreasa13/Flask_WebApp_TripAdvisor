Impressive!,When climbing up to the rock of Acropolis and viewing the Partenon the feelings you experience are so strong. The whole Acropolis shows the glory of Ancient Greek civilization but Parthenon itself is so impressive and dominating. If you love history you will be excited! But even if you do not care about the past I believe that you will enjoy the visit.,December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Incredible! Best hotel for family!,"Traveling with a family of 6 is always a challenge, but this time the things were far too easy. We had booked the suite with balcony which is sooo spacious and we got a great deal contacting directly with the hotel.

I really enjoyed the luxury details (decorated with autentic artworks, high-tech automations, etc) and the location next to the central square. Breakfast in the room was very convenient!

But the best thing was the staff. They made sure that everything would be perfect. The transfer, the suite, the arrangements for restaurants and attractions, even they made the arrangements for baby sitting. Highly recommended!",December 2019,Athens Ikon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15559981-Reviews-Athens_Ikon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Amazing decoration!,The café is OK to be visited. The service um bit indifferent. But the decoration of the Little Kook and the street is magical! If you are in Athens during Christmas time make sure to visit it!,December 2019,Little Kook,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d9710322-Reviews-Little_Kook-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Must see in Braga,"If visiting Braga, then you must pay a visit in the Cathedral of the city. It's an impressive church with small chapels and a beautiful choir. Personally I disliked seeing dead people in chapels, but this is my personal opinion. The choir is one of the most beautiful parts of churches that I have ever seen.",December 2019,Sé de Braga,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189171-d318707-Reviews-Se_de_Braga-Braga_Braga_District_Northern_Portugal.html,"Braga, Portugal",attractions,4.0,4.5
Tasty pasteis de nata,Pasteis de Belem are probably the most famous pasteis de nata in Portugal and one of the most popular spots in Lisboa. The place is really nice and the service very effective and fast despite the long queues. The custard cream is delicious and the natas are some of the best that I have tried.,December 2019,Pastéis de Belém,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d939704-Reviews-Pasteis_de_Belem-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great for late night drinks.,"We visited the bar for a late Sunday evening drink, while everything else was closed and we were lucky enough to have some light snacks and chilled beer. Friendly people and nice service.",December 2019,Casa Agricola,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189180-d2649304-Reviews-Casa_Agricola-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html,"Porto, Portugal",restaurants,5.0,4.5
