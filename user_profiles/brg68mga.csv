Historical Location - WOW,"WOW, we had a visit to the Acropolis on the bucket list, and it did not disappoint.
This is a place that has to be seen to be believed.
The views over Athens are stunning, the history is to be marveled at. There is just so much more to see than just the Parthenon. It is certainly a place you need to take a guided tour so you can get a more detailed understanding of the history, the buildings at what is being undertaken in the restoration process.

Interesting .......BUT,"This free opportunity was recommended to us by the Hotel, and we took up the offer. A good boat trip over, winding through the various back canals on a beautiful day.

To see the master at work blowing the glass was well worth the trip, The downside however was after the glass blowing, a very pushy sales person, guide escorted us through the sales area which put real real dampener on the time there.

Unfortunately based on the sales person, it is not an experience I would recommend. I have to say the people we traveled back to San Marco had the same thoughts. If you buy nothing, don't expect to be dropped back where you were picked up from.

This was our only negative experience in Venice.",September 2019,B.F. Signoretti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g681249-d2471698-Reviews-B_F_Signoretti-Murano_Veneto.html,"Murano, Italy",attractions,2.0,4.0

Worth the Visit,An historical church which has an amazing ambiance about it. The old material fans and the pews just added to the overall experience.

Modern Mall,We found the Lulu Mall a great place to have a meal and browse an incredible range of shops.

Amazing Place,"Humayun's Tomb is a must do when in New Delhi.
Having been to the Taj Mahal we were a little skeptical, though really enjoyed our time here. The buildings, architecture and grounds were well looked after, clean, tidy and simply amazing. There are so many opportunities to get some great photos. Definitely visit Humayun's Tomb and when there just take your time as you will not be disappointed.",September 2017,Humayun's Tomb,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304551-d311618-Reviews-Humayun_s_Tomb-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,"New Delhi, India",attractions,5.0,4.5
Tranquility,The Lotus Temple was so different to other places we had visited. Although busy we got around the gardens and Temple quite easily as the staff / volunteers managed the flow extremely well. The architecture of the Temple itself is quite amazing which radiates a type of pearl lustre. Don't miss the Bahai Lotus Temple.,September 2017,Lotus Temple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304551-d311659-Reviews-Lotus_Temple-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,"New Delhi, India",attractions,5.0,4.0
Great history,We really enjoyed the visit to the museum and got a far better understanding of Gandhi's role in the history of India. Although small there is so much to see. There are a number of stairs and narrow hallways which could make it difficult for some people wishing to visit.,September 2017,Mani Bhavan Gandhi Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304554-d311674-Reviews-Mani_Bhavan_Gandhi_Museum-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great location,"We popped in to have a look at the Boatyard and although we were not staying there we had a chat with the management and they organised a fully guided tour of the premises.
I have to say we were extremely impressed with the rooms, the tidiness and cleanliness of the place and when back in Cochin we will certainly be staying. Having said that the rooms were all well appointed, the pool, proximity to the sea and the bar and restaurant all world class.
Well done to the management and staff.",September 2017,Brunton Boatyard-cgh Earth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297633-d325218-Reviews-Brunton_Boatyard_cgh_Earth-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html,"Kochi (Cochin), India",hotels,5.0,4.5
Crowded,"We drove down Marine Drive returning to our hotel and the place was extremely busy, a real hive of activity. From the car the beach looked fairly average, though the amenities were many and varied.",September 2017,Marine Drive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304554-d321437-Reviews-Marine_Drive-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",attractions,4.0,4.5
