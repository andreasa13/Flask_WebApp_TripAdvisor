"Visit the Acropolis, DON'T buy a ticket through Get Your Guide","I feel robbed and extremely sad that there're still companies like Get Your Guide which unprofessionally insult the consumer's trust.
I purchased a regular ticket to visit Acropolis, which resulted validated three days before. At the entrance, the security informed me that this unpleasant inconvenience happens often times when tickets get bought through Get Your Guide.

I called Get Your Guide five times and always received the same vague explanations. One time I've also trusted them when the customer service person promised me to send a new (hopefully valid) ticket. I was relieved...until I realized she sent me back the same invalid one, with the same booking reference and details. a complete mockery!",October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Quality food, nice atmosphere","Goocha offers lots of culinary choices, mixing high quality seafood and meat, as well as tasty starters.
The only negative aspect of our experience is that, regardless we made a reservation, we had to wait 15’ outside due to the long queue.",April 2019,Goocha Dizengoff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293984-d798461-Reviews-Goocha_Dizengoff-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html,"Tel Aviv, Israel",restaurants,4.0,4.5
A “secret” dinner on the seaside,"Kitchen Market is a lovely gourmet restaurant with a nice view over the Tel Aviv port and cozy interiors. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful dinner filled with quality food and a great service by the waitress Tav. She suddenly suggested us a “secret” menù and we trusted her from the beginning receiving back a perfectly balanced dinner based on seafood including three starters, one mid and one main course dish, matching each and every delicacy with soft white wine.
Few bites have been also offered by the house and Tav has explained everything with competency and passion: definitely a plus benefit accompanying an atmosphere and food already of an high standard.
Overall, the dishes are not too pricey and even if you’re looking for a lighter meal, at Kitchen Market you can find something that will satisfy your palate. For the cherry on the cake, hopefully you’ll get a super nice service like the one Tav provided to us.",April 2019,Kitchen Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293984-d2589192-Reviews-Kitchen_Market-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html,"Tel Aviv, Israel",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Everything you need to enjoy Cape Town,"Sue and Steve are wonderful people who made our stay in Cape Town special. The service is top level with a clean and cozy room plus an amazing breakfast. The house is in a residential quiet area but well located to reach Cape Town's centre and Waterfront area in less than 15' by car.
The swimming pool is great and most of the times you can use it alone by making it your personal villa.",January 2018,The Victorian Goose Guest House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312582-d12571102-Reviews-The_Victorian_Goose_Guest_House-Newlands_Western_Cape.html,"Newlands, South Africa",hotels,5.0,5.0
Nice spot close to the airport,The Aviator hotel is very convenient if you need to spend one night close to the OR Tambo airport because free shuttles carry you to it in few minutes. The service quality is ok and the room is big enough to rest and have a good shower before leaving to the next destination.,December 2017,The Aviator Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312579-d1960389-Reviews-The_Aviator_Hotel-Kempton_Park_Greater_Johannesburg_Gauteng.html,"Kempton Park, South Africa",hotels,4.0,4.0
Breathtaking place in between winery and nature,"I spent one night at Leopard lodge with my girlfriend. It's located in the middle of a game reserve with a stunning lake in front of it and animals like springbok, zebra, ostrich around.

Poor service and average food,"I had a reservation at 8.30pm and arrived at the restaurant at 8.10pm for a quick drink with my girlfriend. We had to wait to seat even at the bar and couldn't order anything. Then we moved outside and ordered our food and a bottle of wine. For more than an hour the waiter continued to apologize for the delay and we finally received our dishes at 10.30pm. Fortunately the view was great, but not even close to the pictures shared on their website, and unfortunately the food was raw and expensive for that quality.",January 2018,The Vue Sky Bar Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312659-d10627392-Reviews-The_Vue_Sky_Bar_Lounge-Cape_Town_Central_Western_Cape.html,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",restaurants,2.0,4.0
