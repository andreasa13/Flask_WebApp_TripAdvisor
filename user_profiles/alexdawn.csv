High end dining on Sifnos,"I’d read the reviews about fancied giving this place a try, parked up in Platis Gialos and luckily got a table straight off - would definitely recommend reserving though if we went again.

Dishes served tapas style - cold/raw/dips/hot etc, food is divine and makes a lovely change from the traditional taverna daily routine.",July 2020,Omega3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g12116658-d4842624-Reviews-Omega3-Platis_Gialos_Sifnos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Sifnos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Perfect,"Great little hotel in Kamares, the port town of Sifnos. Rooms well appointed (everything looks brand new) and spotlessly clean, everything we needed and very affordable!

Opposite the hotel is the cut through directly onto the beach, or turn left and it’s a one minute walk to the Main Street!",July 2020,Morfeas Pension,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1163211-d775197-Reviews-Morfeas_Pension-Kamares_Sifnos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Sifnos, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Gem of a restaurant,"Lucky to have been recommended this by a lovely Athenian who holidays on Paros otherwise we would never have made the trip to Ampelas.

Wonder of the world,"This is a must if you visit Athens, it doesn’t take long to walk up and see the whole thing - budget 2 hours.

We didn’t feel we needed a guided tour as we had already learnt a lot from out Segway trip and visit to the Acropolis museum the day prior, it was brilliant to see the scale of the monuments and the wonderful views of the city.",July 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best of Athens tour,"This is up there with the best Segway rides I’ve been on and easily the best way to see a lot and learn a lot in a few hours!

Our tour guide Krissis was wonderful, a licensed Athens guide, trained archaeologist, speaker of 4 languages and the best sense of humour!

The stop offs and explanations of the various sights was fascinating and interactive, so much history in the city and knowledge from our guide who accommodated all our questions.

Highly recommend hopping on a Segway whilst you let everyone else sweat it out walking :-)

Thanks for a great trip and excellent recommendations for the rest of our stay in Athens and the islands :-)",July 2020,Athens City Segway Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12572102-Reviews-Athens_City_Segway_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great part of Krakow,"The Jewish Quarter is so different from the rest of Krakow’s main old town, it has a real atmosphere and is a living place. Good food and interesting buildings to visit, we’l worth a look.

Golf cart tours: We unfortunately took a tour on one of the little golf carts, our tour was round the Jewish Quarter and then the Ghetto, for 4 of us it was 400 zloty fixed price (circa £20 pp / €25pp) - it lasted about 1 hour with a few stop offs so we could get out and see stuff - however the narration was just a recording played over the speaker in the vehicle in 4 different languages. A disappointing experience for the money when you consider the hourly rate and what you get for it. So beware before jumping into one of these, or haggle for a better rate!",September 2019,Kazmierz The Former Jewish District,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274772-d282371-Reviews-Kazmierz_The_Former_Jewish_District-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Group tour around Schindlers Factory,"I booked this via Walkative tours.

There is so much to read at the museum that it would be impossible to take it all in.

The tour provides a factual overview of what happened to the Jewish people throughout the course of ww2. Schindlers role is raised at the end of the tour, the museum is not specifically dedicated to him but is an exhibition of the Nazi occupation. All 4 places I booked were glad they did the tour and took a lot away from it.",September 2019,Schindlers Factory Private Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274772-d18957648-Reviews-Schindlers_Factory_Private_Tour-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great apartment,"Really enjoyed our apartment.

Only rating 4 out of 5 as when you book (via booking.com) you can’t be sure exactly which apartment you are getting so our group of 4 felt a bit tightly packed, I had anticipated a bigger space from looking at the different photos but they have many apartments in the same building and all are slightly different.

The furnishings are very modern and functional, the sofa bed and pillows were comfortable.

Great shower, nice bathroom.

It’s only a quick walk over the park to get to the old town and market square, approx 5-10 mins - all very safe - we were a group of 4 women walking around at all hours. The castle is literally just down the road - 3 min walk!",September 2019,Old Town Residence Bis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274772-d15516211-Reviews-Old_Town_Residence_Bis-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",hotels,4.0,3.5
Auschwitz-Birkenau,"We did the Aushwitz tour with Krakow Direct tours yesterday, we had wanted to do the 1 day tour which included both Aushwitz and the Salt Mine but this wasn’t possible because I only booked the day before and there was no availability to combine - so we split the trip over two days and did Aushwitz and salt mine separately. Our wonderful driver Michael picked us up on time at our hotel - very knowledgable and kind. We were taken to Aushwitz I and II Birkenau where we were introduced to our on site guide who provided a meaningful explanation of the facts and testimony, his delivery and manner were excellent. Once the tour was concluded, Michael drove us back to our desired destinations in Krakow. I would recommend this company to anyone looking to tour around Krakow and for airport transfers too, the vehicles are immaculate and new.",September 2019,Krakow Tours by KrakowDirect,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274772-d2475678-Reviews-Krakow_Tours_by_KrakowDirect-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",attractions,5.0,5.0
5* room,"We had 2 nights at Beach Republic in Lamai as we wanted to escape Chaweng and see a different part of the island.

The hotel rooms are in a separate block to the beach club, it’s literally just a 2 minute walk and not an inconvenience at all. The rooms are stunning! High ceilings, big comfy bed, patio, kitchenette.

We had the Sunday brunch at the beach club which was fun, lots of choice and very fresh. Live singers then a DJ after.

September is quiet - it’s just the season though, great facilities all round at this place and a 15 min walk up the beach into Lamai town.",September 2019,Beach Republic The Residences,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1188000-d624070-Reviews-Beach_Republic_The_Residences-Lamai_Beach_Maret_Ko_Samui_Surat_Thani_Province.html,"Lamai Beach, Thailand",hotels,5.0,4.5

Rewarding week,"We have just wrapped up our 7 day detox at New Leaf, it has been a fantastic experience and a safe environment which I thoroughly enjoyed.

We came as a couple and have never done a detox or health program before. The group dynamic at the resort is nothing short of brilliant. We hadn’t expected everything to be so social but this is why it all works so well. Everyone is here for their own reasons and there is no judgement whatsoever.

The staff are all wonderful, it was a joy to be around them. The activities were fun, rewarding and very well lead. It was good to just concentrate on getting fit and not worry about eating - you don’t even get hungry despite the extra exercise.

I would definitely come back to New Leaf!",September 2019,New Leaf Detox Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1182465-d17689581-Reviews-New_Leaf_Detox_Resort-Mae_Nam_Ko_Samui_Surat_Thani_Province.html,"Mae Nam, Thailand",hotels,5.0,5.0
Excellent Fish & Chips,"Superb fish and chips on a Sunday afternoon, we sat in the restaurant which was exceptionally clean and friendly atmosphere.

Love this bar!,"My new favourite bar! I made sure we popped in every day of our 4 day holiday on Pag island because I just loved it so much.

All the drinks are expertly hand made - a lot of care goes into the preparation and the quality really shows. It was our absolute pleasure to go there and chill out. Staff very friendly. The beach location is excellent, sea views all round. There are comfy chairs, stools and bean bags and the music selection is perfect for a beach bar.

If you are going to Simuni then this is the place to go for a drink!",June 2019,Kokopelli Beach Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g4560239-d8405020-Reviews-Kokopelli_Beach_Bar-Simuni_Island_of_Pag_Zadar_County_Dalmatia.html,"Island of Pag, Croatia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Delicious fish platter,"We ate here Saturday night, absolutely delicious. We had the fish platter for 2 people (contains 2 whole grilled fish, some mussels, prawns and squid). The fish is the best I have ever had, I'm quite fussy most of the time but I thoroughly enjoyed it. During our meal, there was a huge storm where we all shifted our tables under the rain canopy - the staff handled it excellently.

Excellent apartments in stunning Simuni,"We have just spent 4 nights at these family run apartments, 2 nights in the 2 bedroom sea view apartment with kitchen and then another 2 nights in the 1 bedroom sea view apartment with kitchen.

First of all, Simuni village completely blew us away, we had no idea we were going to stay there but as we arrived to check it out, we knew it was the place for us, luckily Apartments Antica had some availability. The Croatian hosts are lovely, the landlady doesn't speak English but we communicated through her grandson and all was fine.

The self catering apartments have everything you need and great views on the bay. There is ample and easy parking and you can walk easily down a small hill into the town and to the beach.

If you are wanting a quiet holiday spot, this place is wonderful, we liked everything about it and we cooked a lot more than we first anticipated because it was so nice sitting out on the terrace, we were shaded a little with the beautiful grapevine which took away the blistering heat of the sun - highly recommend!",June 2019,Apartments Antica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g4560239-d15695166-Reviews-Apartments_Antica-Simuni_Island_of_Pag_Zadar_County_Dalmatia.html,"Island of Pag, Croatia",hotels,5.0,5.0
Great nights sleep and friendly hostess,"We had a great night at Plitvice Hills guesthouse, we arrived very late due to our own delay and the landlady was very kind and waited up for us to arrive at 11.30pm.

Beautiful room in Zadar,"We stayed in room 12 on 4th floor (street facing), the room was 5* quality fixtures and fittings, high ceilings and traditional old building right in the centre of town close to everything. We liked it so much we booked the exact same room for the last night of our holiday before our flight out of Zadar and even had a deal with breakfast included. Make sure to read your check in email for arrival instructions. This place is a gem!
