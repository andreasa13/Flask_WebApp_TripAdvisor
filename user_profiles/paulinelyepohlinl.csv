Dingle here we mingle,"Taking this scenic drive to South-West of Ireland along the Atlantic coastline makes my heart pound with excitement. Not only the sceneries of the waves lapping the shores were simply breathtaking yet relaxing, but also the sight of awesome rock formations was truly fascinating !! Look at the special formations I posted here.

I was mesmerised by the pristine beauty of nature and its gift left behind for umpteenth decades, one of such that leaves indelible memories is Dingle Peninsular, that’s me stretching out on the lolling greens amidst the backdrop of the peninsular and the wild Atlantic seas. Dingle is a quaint little town with colourful buildings decorating the tranquil surroundings. Join me for more adventure touring around Ireland in the next episodes.",September 2019,Dingle Peninsula,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186610-d523738-Reviews-Dingle_Peninsula-County_Kerry.html,"County Kerry, Ireland",attractions,4.0,5.0
Trekking adventure at Sapa,"A journey to Vietnam is never complete without seeing the beautiful rice terraces in Sapa. Best season to go is between September to October where the rice fields are ready to be harvested.

It was an 8 hour ride with my 3 other friends, in a four sharing bunker in an overnight train from Hanoi. The weather is cool at 23 degrees but sunny.

We trekked up Lao Cai mountains with the help of a friendly local from the Humong local tribe who lived there, with our tour guide. Our petite tour guide is so small framed that I could easily lift her up and swing her around.

The local tribes can walk dextrously up and down the slippery slopes barefooted or even with eyes closed. The locals whom we met along the way exudes so much warmth, making us feel so much at home. I enjoyed joining the farmers, beating the paddy out from its husks although it can be a laborious task if performed the whole day long.

We had so much adventure along the trail and whilst staying at our exclusive private chalet in Lao Cai mountain, Chapa Ecolodge. The view from our chalet is simply breathtaking and it feels so relaxing gazing at the green paddy terraces down below and the mountain ranges in the far distant, while stretching out at the balcony.

At the end of this journey, I feel like singing ‘Somewhere over the rainbow, ....’ And aptly, I did see a rainbow across the sky from my chalet one morning while lounging at the timber deck balcony.

Don’t miss the thrill and excitement in Sapa, it’s certainly a destination not to be missed.",September 2019,"The Best Canyoning Tour in Sapa, Vietnam",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g311304-d20236329-Reviews-The_Best_Canyoning_Tour_in_Sapa_Vietnam-Sapa_Lao_Cai_Province.html,"Sapa, Vietnam",attractions,4.0,4.0
The Real Wonder of the World,"Meteora is utterly amazing with its fascinating rock formations, with ancient monasteries perching on the tips of each rock cluster. I went on a 4 hour train journey from Athens to Kalambaka, the nearest train stop to Meteora. The amazing monasteries and upstanding rocks amidst beautiful green landscape were a sight to behold, a memory that will linger on for time immemorial. Here are my two memorable pictures taken at Meteora, the first with The Holy Trinity monastic church in the background, while the other with me performing a feat lifting a gigantic rock with my feet.",August 2019,Meteora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1070999-d523805-Reviews-Meteora-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Ruins of Acropolis,"It was June 2018 on a scorching hot day when I stepped foot on the ruins of Acropolis, Greece. Draining with sweat & burnt nearly black by the extreme heat was worth it all as the sight was miraculously awesome. I thought that the architecture in the past century was simply amazing indeed!",August 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Spiritual connection brought me back to Potala,"Potala Palace mesmerizes me with its charm since 1997 when I first laid eyes on a photograph hung onto a wall at a monastery in Kathmandu, Nepal. From then on, I dreamt of visiting this place before I leave this world. The only thing that held me back choosing from my other favorite travel destinations that I travelled to in the past, is the fear of high altitude sickness and breathing difficulty. Once I step foot onto it, I felt a spiritual connection to this place. I climbed up to the top at the peak without any issue and gazed at Lhasa city from the top. It was a rare and wonderful experience.",September 2019,China Highlights Lhasa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294223-d7020455-Reviews-China_Highlights_Lhasa-Lhasa_Tibet.html,"Lhasa, China",attractions,5.0,5.0
