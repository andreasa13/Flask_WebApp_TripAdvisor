Amazing but be careful!,"This is somewhere I have always wanted to visit and was so thrilled to be there. It is truly beautiful and the whole experience is incredible.

Following advice on here (thank you all) I aimed to get there at 8am opening. Due to delays on transport I ended up getting there about 8.30. Accessed it by tourist information and Acropolis station.

This is by all accounts the easier access point but beware...its still hard going. Fairly steep in places with slippy rocks.
Having read this before I went (thanks again every one on TA!) I brought some Karrimor ultra dyna grip walking trainers. I am clumsy and honestly dont think I would have made it without them....I did see a few women in high heels and plenty of people in flip flops so depends on the person I guess. I also saw 3 people fall over...

Once you are at the top of the hill almost entering the Acropolis...there are some high steps. This is quite common in Athens area...I struggle with those massive steps with no barriers (scared of heights!), but a kind lady helped me up. There is a staircase on the left of this which you can access too though...so that's helpful...would rather climb the normal stairs with the handrail than the huge ones!

Once up there you can spend as long as you like there which I think is awesome. Really enjoyed walking around at my own pace and experiencing it. The tour groups started to arrive around 9am which is around the time I made it to the top but just went the opposite way round to them so wasn't too crowded.

I left around 11.30 and they were allowing access only in one entrance and exit only the other...I had to leave via the steps and it was access only through the slopes (by the theatre)

This was fine and you come out just by Aeropagus Rock and can hear the singing from pilgrimages and there are lots of craft stalls which is fun.

Overall I loved it but in general have found here very little health and safety and zero signage...so just take that into account and you will be fine

Enjoy the experience it's truly spectacular.

Also one more word of warning - if anyone tries to give you a bracelet they take your hand and tie it on...using 4 or 5 knots saying it's free then demand money. They are very aggressive. Polite Nos do not work
I shouted at the top of my voice ""Please leave me alone "" &, that worked but I have watched so many people be roped in whilst sitting nearby people watching.
There are also rose people who do the same with Rose's and beggar ladies with children...do not make eye contact...say No firmly and they do leave you alone.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Tiny but ideal location,"Stayed here in February when it was Milford Plaza as part of a very large group (over 50 of us on a drama trip).

There were 4 of us in a room, two double beds and be prepared the rooms are tiny! There was enough room for both beds and a tiny amount of space to walk between. The bathroom is barely big enough to turn around in. However, this worked for us - we were just using it as a base and it was clean and modern, we liked it.

It is also perfectly located between Times Square and Hells Kitchen, we couldn't have asked for a more ideal spot.

I also thought the interesting lift concept worked very well - you put your number in to the lift on the ground floor & then you have to go to the assigned lift.

Was more than happy with the cleanliness of the rooms, although some sweets we had brought did go missing on one day - we think they may have been accidentally thrown away. Due to the size of the rooms, obviously shopping bags are going to be on the floor (as there is literally nowhere to put them) so staff need to make sure that they are even more careful about belongings, but overall we have no complaints about cleanliness.

The reason I haven't given it a full star rating:

1) The rest of our group got checked in fine apart from 2 room (ours and another one). It was over a 2 hour wait and no real apologies or any empathy - we had just flown in from London after all.

2) When we finally got in our room. Our safe was broken and so was our tv. I went down on the way out to report this, and was told by the staff (understandably) that we would need to be in our room to fix them (although this has never been the case in other hotels I have stayed in, if that is their policy this is fine). I came back earlier than the rest of my party from dinner out to get this sorted. TWO hours later, I was still waiting - the rest of my group had come back & gone to bed & we were still waiting for this to be fixed!! I called down repeatedly to the front desk to be constantly brushed aside, and eventually went out in the hallway & grabbed a passing maintenance man! This was a severely bad level of service.

3) Outside of the hotel is touts selling tickets for bus tours. One that is located very close to the doors is Go New York (Green bus). This is a severly dodgy company (as Trip Advisor proves) and I had an awful experience with them. I went to advise the Hotel Reception and they told me they already knew & basically what did I expect as it was a cheaper option than the others. If they already knew, why were they not advising guests on check in? Why were there no posters up in the lifts advising to avoid this company? I have travelled all over the world and think this would be done everywhere else, especially in England. It shows a severe lack of care to say 'yes we knew and we didn't care enough to warn you.'.

However overall, we had a very enjoyable stay at the Milford Plaza. Would I stay here again? Probably, its an excellent base and such an amazing location, but I would be very interested to compare it to other hotels in the area.

On a positive note, our group had a wonderful time in NYC - we loved it there :-)",February 2014,Row NYC Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1938661-Reviews-Row_NYC_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,3.0,3.5
Under rennovation unfortunately,"Amazing to see a Cathedral in the middle of a busy street especially one as iconic as 5th Avenue!

Was very excited about seeing St Patrick's but unfortunately it was under heavy rennovation and refurbishment when I was there. Could barely see anything outside and when I got inside it was even worse... would have been good to have been forewarned about this (maybe outside - if you are on a bus then you would know not to get off for example).

I did sit on the steps for a bit and watch the world go by and sat inside to get the feel but was quite disappointed overall.

Will be lovely to see when rennovations have finished though!",February 2014,St. Patrick's Cathedral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d136053-Reviews-St_Patrick_s_Cathedral-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,3.0,4.5
Warning - do not use,"I had an absolutely awful experience with this company. It's a long story but basically was trapped on this bus for 4 hours plus, driver would not let us off & did not keep us informed about what was happening, or offer us the chance to leave the bus at any time (surely there were places he could have legally stopped between Wall Street & Times Square). He changed the route & refused to keep us informed.

The staff are intimidating & aggressive. The buses have no heaters, leak water & feel unsafe.

The guide is a recording & they cannot/do not pause it whilst in traffic, so often you are nowhere near where they are talking about.

I would give zero stars if I could. Pleaae please avoid these conmen at all costs. Their license to operate should be revoked - cannot believe the City of New York is allowing it to continue!!",February 2014,TopView Sightseeing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d3533829-Reviews-TopView_Sightseeing-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,1.0,3.0
Lovely hotel with some issues,"My friend, her small son and myself stayed at H10 Las Palmeras in May.

Firstly we had an amazing holiday, this hotel is ideally located with an absolutely lovely pool.
The lobby is beautiful, the pool area fantastic with plenty of sun loungers. The pools themselves are lovely, could not rate them higher - childrens pool perfect, adult pool even better. There were always plenty of sunloungers and umbrellas. There is a life guard always on duty during pool opening hours.

The rooms are good, but it does seem they have cut corners for example the mattresses are not especially comfy & the shower screen does nothing to protect the rest of the bathroom from the shower, however well you try to position it. Despite this minor issue, the rooms are spacious, very clean and the balcony is lovely with high/well protected sides so there it does feel safe. There is a safe in the room, which is great, although you do have to pay a fee to use it. We did not get a remote control, which you also have to pay a fee for. Our balcony looked out onto the street, but you could still see the sea in the background, so no complaints there.

All Inclusive aspect - perfect. Could not have asked for better. The food is just absolutely gorgeous, fish freshly cooked in front of you at both lunch and tea. A massive selection, where even the pickiest of eaters would be able to find something delicious and an absolutely fantastic array of deserts. The drinks were also great - bottles of water on the side that you could pick up at your leisure, open fizzy drinks machine, along with wine & beer. All just left for you to serve yourself.
There is a pool bar which has a selection of snack foods for example make yourself ham & cheese toasties & also has all the drinks available. There is also small pots of ice cream that you are able to help yourself too.
The set up was well thought out & very relaxed. The food & drinks were delicious (& drinks tasted branded rather than cheap & nasty as you sometimes expect!).
The staff in all the restaurants & bars were very friendly, helpful and polite. The only thing we were often confused about was sometimes there were waiter service for certain tables but we could not figure out why this was or any reasoning behind this as you could generally choose where you want to sit.
The Italian restaurant was lovely, as AI you can eat in here for one evening completely free & the food there was beautiful.
You could also get Cocktails from the pool bar or bars inside at any time - all covered in AI.

There is a small play area for children, as well as pool tables & a small gift shop (that never seemed to be open in the afternoons). There were always stalls by the dining hall each day different selling lovely jewellery.

To access the beach you go through a back gate & are straight out onto the seafront. The sand there was not particularly nice & it is difficult access to the sea over very slippy rocks but it makes for a nice change to the pool.

The area H10 is in, is very lively. There are all the bars & clubs on your left hand side - however they are far enough away not to bother you when you are in the hotel & there was nothing about the area that made us feel anything but relaxed - this is just something to keep in mind in evenings when out walking. There are lovely walks with shops & restaurants all along the sea front, meaning it is very easy to go for long, lovely walks in the evening.

All of this is very positive so far & as I said, I really did like this hotel. However there are a few negatives:
1) There are four lifts for a ridiculous number of rooms. This means the lifts are in constant use & the long delays in waiting for the lifts means they are often overcrowded as people are waiting so long they get frustrated & then cram into the lift every time it stops. The result of this? The lifts unfortunately are subject to breaking down ALOT. We were on 5th floor with a pushchair, if the lifts were broken, the staff were not in the least bit interested & when we asked for help - they said they were not willing to help us.
2) Also related to the lifts, one evening myself & 8 others got stuck in the lift for over half an hour - this was pretty scary. The staff knew how long we had been stuck in the lift but not one member of staff came to check we were okay (& one lady was really shook up). The maintenance man let us out without a word & there was no one in sight to apologise or check we were okay, which I would have thought would be common procedure. When I went to ask about the state of the lifts the following day at Reception & how safe they were - we were told they were not really that safe as they were being repaired now as people had got stuck last night. I advised it was myself who had got stuck & the response? They laughed! I was not in the slightest bit impressed & thought this was appalling customer service.
3) I was having a misunderstanding with my transfer company about the pick up time for the airport, I know my language skills are terrible & thought it may be a fault on my side so went to ask for help at reception if they could explain my reasoning to the transfer company in Spanish. I was very polite & apologetic about this. The receptionist was not in the slightest bit helpful, she was very rude & eventually dialled the company then handed me the phone! Would not help at all with my request! When talking to reception they frequently just answer the phone (I understand the reasoning behind why they do this) without a simple apology or word of explanation, often mid sentence!

Overall this was a beautiful resort & I would book here again, the food & pool area were especially lovely & we very much enjoyed our stay. If some minor aspects were tweaked (better mattresses, better Reception staff & better lifts) then this would be an exceptional hotel :-)",May 2013,H10 Las Palmeras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562820-d289677-Reviews-H10_Las_Palmeras-Playa_de_las_Americas_Arona_Tenerife_Canary_Islands.html,"Tenerife, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Excellent, clean budget hotel with fantastic pool","We stayed bed & breakfast at this hotel & I would highly recommend the Lux Mar. We had a room in the Tropical Gardens, with a beautiful view of the gorgeous pool area & a view (which is over a building but still a great view). The balcony was lovely & could not see any people either side. Being pretty much the closing week it was fairly quiet but the walls are pretty thin, although this did not bother us at all.

My first impression as I walked into the hotel was great, it was clean & bustling. However my second impression was not great - I imagine this is up for debate depending on how each individual views things, but we booked this hotel with booking.com & knew we would pay when we got there. However I was arriving 6 hours earlier than my friend who had made the original booking on her card. They refused to allow me to check in. I offered to get my friend to call the hotel & pay over the phone on her card, as we would have been fine with the full amount being taken before we arrived but all information said 'during our stay' so we did not think it would be a problem. They said they could not allow my friend to call in because we could have stolen the card!! I work in Customer Services & know this is not the case, how do websites/call centres ever take card details off anyone if this is policy? I also do not see what the problem is with allowing me to check in & then my friend paying when she arrived, but at the very least take payment over the phone. This was not up for discussion however, I was not allowed to check in & that was that! I am not sure what they thought we were going to do with the room! There is nothing to steal & if the photo copied my passport what damage could I do?!!!

After them saying there was no way around this - I was not allowed to check in & I was panicking, my friend called in & they agreed to let her email a photo of her passport & her card details over & they would allow me to check in. This was the most bizarre thing I have ever heard!! What if we had stolen a passport & the card ha - there was no logic in this policy at all.

Finally i checked in, with no account being taken by staff that I may have been a bit nervous being in a new country alone for several hours. Regarding the attitude of the staff on the front desk - while I was waiting a girl came in to ask the rate of the hotel. They just replied ' we are fully booked' - they had not even asked the girl what night she was thinking of!! When she confirmed it was not for that night, they advised they could not book at the front desk she would have to call a call centre - one of the most bizarre things I have ever heard!!

However after all this - the room was lovely & at first glance I was not sure about the shower but it was completely fine - it was actually a really good shower.

The mix of people in the hotel were great, all ages ranges - we were worried we may feel out of place but the age range was wide & suitable for all ages. The pool area itself was lovely, the one in the photos looks nothing like it does in advertising & is very small & looks a bit dingy but the one behind the Tropical Gardens is beautiful, big pool with a gorgeous water fountain & lots of sun loungers. We had no problem getting one whenever we wanted one.

If you go out of the hotel & left, there is a free carpark which although is quite busy you can usually find a spot. By this car park there is a pathway that if you follow it & go under the lit tunnel its a short & pleasant walk into Ibiza Town. This walk was great & we got a taxi back costing no more than 8 Euros.

There are some restaurants around the area of the hotel, but no lively bars which is what the area is missing. There is also quite a few empty shops but the restaurants that are in the area are lovely & its only a 6 or 7 Euro Taxi Drive to Playa D'en Bossa which has a fantastic atmosphere & restaurants. Bora Bora & Space are both on the main strip in Bossa & the beach there is lovely.

In advertising it did say that this hotel is yards from the beach, this is not the case at all. The tiny beach which is not very nice near the hotel belongs to the Hotel Les Molinas & does not look very welcoming or nice at all. Its a tiny strip that I personally would not call a beach. A small amount of sand on a seaweed bed maybe, However its a nice 10/15 minute walk around the coast to a much more pleasant long strip of beach,

We only had breakfast which was the same food every day (some english breakfast type foods, fruit, pastries). This was a nice breakfast except for one day which was foul. The toaster does not work, so the toast is always hard/overcooked or undercooked. However overall was quite impressed with the breakfast. One day we were sat eating breakfast & a staff member came out & turned all the lights off leaving us in darkness, came out looked at us & carried on!! We had to move to an area that was lit by windows. RUDE!! However on a whole the staff were pleasant & friendly.

The beds were also fairly uncomfortable, hard & lumpy but the room itself was a good size, with great air conditioning & a lovely balcony.

I think this hotel is perfect for a base as its a reasonable distance & fairly reasonable taxi ride away from both Ibiza Town & Playa d'en Bossa. We could not figure out the buses, which seemed to arrive & depart of their own accord so we mainly used taxis or walked.

Overall despite any issues we had this was a good base for an absolutely fantastic holiday & Ibiza is an amazing place, so beautiful & I would stay here again.",September 2012,Hotel Apartamentos Lux Mar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g664638-d530144-Reviews-Hotel_Apartamentos_Lux_Mar-Ibiza_Town_Ibiza_Balearic_Islands.html,"Ibiza, Spain",hotels,4.0,3.5
Appallingly Rude Service vs lovely food,"I live in Stratford-Upon-Avon & we have eaten here more times than I could count.

We have experienced some appalling rudeness from the staff over time & witnessed it to other customers (lunch is often advertised as 12-2 but I have seen them refuse to serve someone coming in just after 1pm out of sheer laziness I assume!) & they do not do it in a kind way.

The only reason we have kept going back is because we enjoyed the food. However this evening, I have never witnessed something so disgusting - the waitress who is definitely the one described below - who looks at you like you are a massive inconvenience to her life. Took our order & when I got it, I informed the waitress this was not what I ordered. I was very polite, but surprised. She then proceeded to tell me that Sweet & Sour chicken at this restaurant was Sweet & Sour Chicken balls. Having been in chineses all over the country including this one where I have ordered this exact dish before, I obviously argued the point & said that it does not mention that this is balls on the menu at all (obviously there is a distinct difference!). The waitress, then stomped off & when I questioned her attitude & said she was rude, she told me I was in fact rude!!

I did not want this dish at all but because she would not relent, we ended up buying the dish & ordering a different one. So I guess, her extreme rudeness got more money out of us!

I work in customer service & can honestly say I would be fired if I even did half of what this waitress did this evening. I am very respectful of people & nothing I did deserved this behaviour .

When telling this story to others, everyone had a story about the terrible customer service & appalling behaviour of this waitress. Several people also told me they would not eat here because of it & they have experienced the appalling customer service on both the phone when ordering takeaways & in person.

This is also a fairly expensive restaurant & I am unsure whether I will ever eat here again or not. I may do, but I am not sure if expensive & some of the most disgusting customer service I have ever seen in my entire life vs good food is enough!!",November 2011,Must-Go Chinese,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186399-d1532890-Reviews-Must_Go_Chinese-Stratford_upon_Avon_Warwickshire_England.html,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,2.5
Enjoyable family entertainment,"I was absolutely terrified about going to this Pontins after reading all the reviews on here. There was 7 of us going as a family & we were extremely worried about going after reading these reviews.

We went Monday 13th-Friday 17th. When we got there just before 2pm we checked into our Club class Chalets with no problem, staff were very friendly & we checked in straight away. They responded to our requests & gave us two chalets next door to each other, which we were pleased about. Walking to the chalets we were still very nervous but when we got there, found lovely grass square which would be fantastic for children to play in if the weather was good (it was not!) & lovely patio doors. Each chalet had two bedrooms, both very clean & the kitchen area was spotless. The carpets were not great, would advise to keep your shoes or socks on, but overall the chalets were very clean. If they gave them a new carpet, they would be perfect.

The shower is ridiculous - you have to hold the button in which basically makes it impossible to shower, but the bathroom was very clean & we were very impressed by the chalet as a whole. No complaints here about the chalets.
I have read reviews that say all the classes of chalets are exactly the same, but we saw different levels of chalets. Club class have patio doors & we had a look at the other chalets as we walked past & although they looked slightly smaller, they all seemed clean & roomy. One point to make was the disabled parking was not very close, which may make it difficult for someone who cannot walk well. We were told over the phone that parking was just outside the chalet, it is not. Its a street length away at least which does make it difficult.

The main area, was also fine....the Fun Factory was clean, cheap & cheerful. The restaurant was clean & the staff were all very polite. The food is not the best but is cheap & cheerful.

The one thing we were not happy about was the fun fair/crazy golf was not open once thoroughout our entire stay & the climbing wall was open very early in the morning as we could see people on it (like 8am/9am) but closed soon after for the rest of the day.

We used Pontins as a base & came back around 5pm for the evening entertainment. If you fancy a drive, crosby beach has some fantastic statues on it & nearby Silcocks' entertainment arcade was very fun. One thing Southport seems to lack (well they may have it but we could not find it) was little gifts shops with seaside goods in etc, we looked but could find nothing like this. Also apparently 13th September is out of season which we were surprised at! All the boat trips/mini railway were shut only open at the weekend which we were gutted about!!
We did go on on tram on the pier which was lovely.

Now evening entertainment at Pontins starts with bingo at 6.30/7pm. I will say this before I go further that the Blue Coats work exceptionally hard & they do a great job. But they seem to have too much power & I believe this power has gone to their heads & this did affect the atmosphere.

For example during bingo - we thought even though over 18s only can play, there must be allowances made for children as we are at PONTINS & surely mainly only families go to Pontins, but apparently bingo at pontins has to be played in SILENCE!! Which is very odd, as we attend bingo quite regularly & you are allowed some communication throughout!! The bluecoats shushed their hearts out, even once at a sobbing very young baby. The poor mother was so harrassed she had to leave her newly brought bingo cards & take her infant out. After the first night, we split up our party & my brother took my niece to the play barn while we played bingo, but its such a shame if any parent have brought their children alone because there is no mixing of the adults/children activites.

Also another thing the blue coats do which goes against any form of rudimentary childcare - is they do dancing with the children & then make them sit down & watch something. Get them all hyped up & sit down, hyped up & sit down. Is there any reason when shows are on why the children can't dance?

The same rules pretty much applied to the adults too - they wanted us sat down watching these shows. Examples of power gone too far;

A women walks across the dance floor when a stage show (on the stage, not dancefloor) is going on & blue coat says 'Would you do that at the theatre love?' (stops the show to say this!! - well its not exactly the west end is it?!) & during one show a gentleman at the back of the room completely out of sight was dancing 'Please sit down mate, they pay to watch me not you' - then security came to make him sit down.

Its all very odd, as I said they work exceptionally hard & we really enjoyed the shows they put on & everything was still fun, it just would have been a much more relaxed atmosphere if they had let things be relaxed. No reason children can't dance & no reason the dancefloor can't be walked across, just as there is no reason you can't have children in bingo!!

Overall we had a lovely enjoyable holiday with lovely family entertainment - we really did have a lovely time & it was a great place for a family holiday. We would go back here again & we would recommend it to friends. Its no frills, but still we had fun & enjoyed ourselves every day which is exactly what you want on a family break!",September 2010,Pontins Southport Holiday Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g191255-d671263-Reviews-Pontins_Southport_Holiday_Park-Southport_Merseyside_England.html,"Southport, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,2.0
"Brillant location - clean hotel, pity about atmosphere","First of all, we had an absolutely AMAZING holiday in Alanya. I am a firm believer in a holiday is what you make it & my friend & I had a wonderful time. It was one of the best holidays I have ever had.

This was in no way because of Gold Safran hotel. The atmosphere in the hotel is awful, we got a strong impression that they hate the english. 95% of the guests are Russian/German/Dutch & they are generally very rude to everyone else. All the english appeared to be put on 5th floor, with a lift that seemed a bit dodgy. This also meant that the rooms were not cleaned until about 4pm everyday, meaning we had no clean towels etc when we came back from the beach & were usually trying to have a nap just as the cleaners knocked on the door. It also seemed strange to us, how the cleaners did rooms next to ours earlier in the day but never the 'english rooms' so to speak until very late.

The Receptionists were also hard work. Especially the female receptionist who was often so rude that it took our breath away. For example, we would be stood facing her asking for a key & she would reach over & put it well beyond our reach so we would have to walk for the key. This may seem like a very small issue, but after a week of constant rudeness it is very grating. We always tried our very best to be very polite but were fighting a losing battle with this one.

We also asked to see our Rep about 5 times, every time they said they had never heard of Karen Williams, who had worked there for 8 years, therefore as they did not know who she was I was not able to leave a message for her. On the last day, the one friendly receptionist (male) admitted he did know who she was & left a message for her. By this time we were pretty much ready to check out & so when reception gave us her number, we did not call because thought there was no point. I would advise trying to go to the welcome meeting so you at least know what she looks like. Unfortunately the welcome meeting was at 1.30pm on the day we arrived & we arrived at 8am, so had literally just woken up & was grabbing some food when the welcome meeting was taking place!!

Our room itself was very nice, it was spacious & the balcony was lovely, overlooking the street, really lovely big rooms. However the one major major problem with the room is - there was large double bed in the living room area & then a seperate bedroom with twin beds. The air conditioning unit was located in the main living room. This meant the bedroom was like an oven. Its ridiculous that their is not a seperate air con unit in the bedroom & when we asked for a fan, the hotel staff acted like we had asked for the earth & refused point blank. Obviously one of us slept in the living room & the other one had the bedroom with the door open, but this bedroom was stifling hot. This made sleeping very difficult & we were very surprised that this was not taken into account. Surely air con in the bedrooms should be standard.

There is a safe in the room which costs 28L for the week.

The food was pretty horrendous - we were not expecting great food every day, but it was pretty the worst AI food I have been on. Luckily they did have chips or potato wedges every day so we got to eat something. If they do run out of anything, if you asked for more then they would usually get it for you, so this was good. One thing they did which we thought was odd, was the set all the knives & forks out on the tables. This is fine for the first sitting but the hotel was to capacity, so every table would probably be sat at 3 times in an evening. Every evening we would have to spend ages looking for staff to ask for knives & forks & more often than not we would end up using tiny dessert cutlery as it was just easier!!

The location of the hotel is ideal - its right in a small area called Obagal which has loads of shops & restaurants just on your door. The area is lovely & if you walk to the main road & hop on the very frequent buses it will take you to alanya centre for just 1L. We always got a taxi back which cost about 15L.

The beach is also a very short walk away & the sunbeds at the beach cost about 5l most days. Some of the hotels have deals with the sunbed people but from what we could gather the Gold Safran did not. The beach is lovely & this was where we spent most days as the hotel pool seemed very small compared to the amount of guests there was & most sunbeds were taken by the time we got up.

Due to the atmosphere, we spent very little time in the hotel but as I said the area was lovely & we had a very lovely time wondering around the shops. just a note, but Alanya is not cheap - everything is about the same price or more expensive than england - cocktails on average worked out to about £8 or £9 but you could usually find them at buy one get one free if you looked. The only things we found cheap was silver & ice cream!!

There was a lot of restaurants in the area where the food was lovely, so we ate there fairly often & the atmosphere throughout all these restaurants & shops was fantastic, all the locals are really friendly.

The Turkish bath at the hotel was good & the shop staff were very friendly.

On checkout, we asked for late checkout as checkout was at noon & we were not being picked up for transfer until midnight that night. The female receptionist who we knew was nasty told us that the hotel was full, there was no late checkout & that our rooms were urgently needed. We checked out & when we came back from the beach many hours later, asked for a shower. The male receptionist then asked us why we had left our rooms so early. This made us believe that the female receptionist had not been telling the truth. We had to have a shower in the turkish bath which was a bit of a palaver & from the way the staff was acting, made us seem like people did not seem to ask to do this. Other english people asked us later where we could shower - so we assumed it was an english thing rather than a rest of the world thing. My friend is widely travelled & she said she has never encountered a situation such as this, where there is no shower room available for guests checking out at odd hours.

The transfer from the hotel to the airport was fine but the transfer at the beginning of the holiday was not good. We used A2B transfers & the driver did not know where a single hotel was. A majority of the guests on the bus was going to Gold Safran but he seemed certain that we would get to that one last for reasons we could not phanthom. But he found it randomly & dropped us off. We were very confused as to how the transfer drivers did not know where any of the hotels were that he was dropping off too!! Before we got to Alanya he tried to drop a family off at the wrong hotel, luckily the women was very vigilant & knew instantly that the area had two hotels with the same name & then we had to spend absolutely ages finding the right hotel!!

Overall as I said this was a fantastic holiday, we really could not have enjoyed ourselves more, we loved every minute of our holiday & Alanya is an absolutely wonderful place.

I would say go to this hotel if you are just using it simply as a base like we did, but if you are planning a holiday where you use the AI features to the maximum & don't intend to leave the hotel much, I would not suggest this hotel!!",July 2010,Gold Safran,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297961-d557234-Reviews-Gold_Safran-Alanya_Turkish_Mediterranean_Coast.html,"Alanya, Turkey",hotels,3.0,3.0
Excellent,"Could not recommend this hotel higher - it was beautiful, so clean, staff were so friendly from the moment we arrived - the swimming pool was beautiful & sauna lovely. The rooms were gorgeous, roomy & the beds really comfortable. We had a brillant stay at the hotel, would absolutely recommend it to anyone - great value for money & the icing on the cake was the 5pm check out on Sunday!! The late check out made our weekend, it made it a much longer break & much more relaxed!! We will definitely stay here next time we go to Reading!!

My one grip was a minor one - but we both had to present our cards on the way back into the hotel on saturday night - we had been out & my friend couldn't find hers in her bag. I understand this is a security measure, but surely if you are with someone who has a card than that should be enough - I imagine it could get very embarrassing for young couples!! Surely if you have paid for the room & are with someone that has a card that should be enough?

However that is only a minor comment - I honestly could not recommend this hotel more, it was absolutely fantastic!!",June 2010,Novotel Reading Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186363-d608186-Reviews-Novotel_Reading_Centre-Reading_Berkshire_England.html,"Reading, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
Absolutely fantastic hotel - could not have asked for better,"Like others, having read the reviews just before we went - my friend and I were a little concerned about the hotel. It was a last minute holiday, so we did not know what to expect. When we first walked into the Festival De Jardin we thought it was too good to be true. The lobby was beautiful - all in marble and the staff were friendly. We checked in straight away and a bellboy took our bags to our rooms. Our first impression of the room was that it was perfect, our view from the balcony was the sea and we could not have asked for more. The room has a safe with a code that you are able to set yourself and we thought this was important (we could not find this mentioned anywhere before we went!). Like others, we found the bathroom slightly shabby, but it was very clean so no complaints there and the whole room was cleaned completely everyday. We even got freshly made beds everyday. The cleaning staff were very friendly as were all the staff. There are numerous pools, all beautiful - we especially liked the saltwater pool on the beach and only once could we not get a sunbed with shade on there - so we managed to get one nearby on the beach. The dining hall was clean and I am an incredibly picky eater so was concerned about the all inclusive aspect - but at every single meal I was able to find something I liked - and you can't ask for more than that for me! Whats more the food was delicious and plentiful and the staff helpful. At every meal a certain waiter recognised us and instantly brought our drinks without us even asking, which was lovely. There are numerous bar snacks throughout the day, all inclusive - and chips are always available at one of the pool bars if you fancy them!! All the staff were incredibly lovely and went out of their way to be helpful. Like others we found the constant selling on the beach a bit much, we had already decided what trips we were going to do before we got there, so the selling on the beach was completely un necessary - but once we had booked all our trips and were very firm, they pretty much left us alone. We went on two trips (snorkelling to see dolphins and a desert adventure both great days out and value for money) and I also went on the aquascope submarine that was also fun. A few things - we were two girls alone, and the vast majority of holiday goers there were families or couples - this was not a problem to us at all, we did not mind but it did mean we got quite a lot of attention - my friend especially, we were not really expecting this within the hotel. Also a majority of the other holiday goers are russian - it is completely shocking how they behave, they are rude and will eat all the food if they are given a chance or just take it even if they don;t want it!! (example I was in a queue for chips that had just ran out, so was waiting for new ones to be cooked, there was a russian in front of me and one behind. When the new lot of chips came out, the russian in front took all the chips, leaving about 5 for me. The russian behind then tried to push in to get them.). It is unbelieveable how they act, it is disgusting. They are just plain rude and i have come away from this holiday vowing never to visit Russia!! The women are also mainly all exhibitionists which is not suitable for a muslim country. The hotel had a rule that was no swimwear in the lobby, which we thought was fair enough and constantly - at least every day there was a Russian flaunting this rule and having to be told by the hotel staff and then ignoring them in an extremely rude way!!! I feel this would be a problem in peak season (the hotel was only approx 50% full when we went) - as the Russians would be very aggressive when it came to claiming sunbeds, as there was a lot free at this time we had no problems but we could see how it would be a problem. For families - I would also highly recommend this hotel, there seemed to be alot for children to do, including lots of play areas. Overall the hotel was fantatsic, the staff great and our Thomas Cook Rep Natalie also went out of her way to make sure we were fine even though we had no problems whatsoever. I could not recommend this hotel more - our only complaint was that we wished we had booked 2 weeks instead of just the 1!!!",May 2009,Hawaii Le Jardin Aqua Park Resort - Families and Couples Only,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297549-d1092538-Reviews-Hawaii_Le_Jardin_Aqua_Park_Resort_Families_and_Couples_Only-Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html,"Hurghada, Egypt",hotels,5.0,4.0
