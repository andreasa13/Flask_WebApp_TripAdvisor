An excellent dinner in a nice setting,"The four of us had a great time at this restaurant. It’s located close the busy Bahnhofstrasse but yet at the end of a tranquil side street. The atmosphere was nice, the service attentive and the food very delicious. I had a the beef fillet & wok vegetables which were both cooked to perfection. It could not have been any better! The other dishes my family members had ( Fettuccine with beef/crispy chicken salad/spring rolls) were also very nice. The dessert & ice cream (Mango/Lime scoop) we ordered were also excellent and unique. We were all very happy and enjoyed the evening out in Zurich very much.

Excellent choice!,"Located in a lively (still quiet) about 10 minutes away by foot from the Acropolis museum and the nearest metro station Sygrou-Fix, this B&B is a true hidden gem. We were a family of 4 (2 teenagers) and loved our stay (3 nights) very much: nice, safe, quiet location, very clean rooms (2nd floor, stairs only) nice AC, nice bathroom, good WiFi, refrigerator in the room (free water) free choice of a breakfast menu (very yummy menus to choose from including a coffee and a freshly squeezed orange juice), nice and relaxed hosts and excellent cleaning ladies (they did a superb job with an eye on details).

Excellent - everything from A-Z!,"All meals we ordered (family with two teenagers) were excellent and of a very high quality. The service was outstanding and the owner, who spent 8 years working in top notch restaurants in NYC knows his business and is fun to talk to.

A must visit place,"Luckily, due to the issues related to COVID-19, not very many tourists were visiting this historic place. This made our visit very nice, agreeable and relaxed. The view overlooking the Greek capital with 5 Million inhabitants was stunning. I guess, the Parthenon is always under construction.

Excellent Falafels,This a very small but excellent place for a quick bite to eat if you are not looking for a fancy restaurant. Their food is fresh and of very high quality.

What a positive surprise,"My wife and I (Swiss and around 50 years of age) had a very nice dinner at this kind of hidden restaurant. For 60 Euro, including a tip, we both had some yummy garlic bread as a starter, then a good beef fillet, French fries, a on the side Mixed Salat, a Beer, a Glass of nice red wine, water, two delicious desserts (chocolate mousse & a crepe with grand marnier/vanilla ice cream) and a coffee.

Very good place for the price you pay for,"I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn’t need the luxury of a 5 star hotel but has certain expectations that need to be met while being on a holiday.

Today, we showed up at 09:10 and very much too our surprise breakfast was already closed.

You’re able to choose one out of three appetizers, main courses and desserts. The three courses I choose were all good and the set price was € 29.90, drinks not included.

Good place for a good piece of meat,"Despite having higher expectations, we still had a good night out. The service was friendly, the variety of beers (national and international) was nice, the „ceasar salad“ I ordered was good eventhough it was after all not really a true ceasar salad (iceberg lettuce and no romaine, chicoree?, french dressing, beacon strips laid on top of the salad, slivers of parmesan,... We all ordered a Swiss Steak/Entrecôte, the meat was good and lean; it could have had a little bit more taste and one of my friends Steak was cooked too long.

Mixed Opinion,"We were a group of 8 and our opinions varied quite a bit. Some were pleased with what they ordered while others were disappointed.
Since we were celebrating our National Day, we treated ourselves with a cocktail. They were good, especially the Strawberry Daiquiri, but they could have used more alcohol and less syrup.
The quiche with a small salad (N$ 45) was very good and in comparison with some other dishes a bargain. A chef's salad costs N$ 85; that salad is pretty small and includes low quality ingredients, such as iceberg salad. The garden salad next door at the ""Brewery"" costs the same and is ten times better. The risotto and the chicken Schnitzel were okay. The service was friendly and good. However, we were almost the only ones in the restaurant; the kitchen closes at 21:00.

The food (chicken fajita) I ordered was served immediately; I mean, literally within one minute after I pleced the order! The portion of chicken was huge, the pieces were also big (not meant to put inside a tortilla) not appealing, not very warm and just not good at all.

However, the longer we were there the sloppier the service got. The mixed salad I ordered was good, but the pizzas we got could have been much better. They had no taste, the doughs were blend and there was hardly any sauce on them. After the tiramisu we ate, we had to wait a great until we got the bill.
