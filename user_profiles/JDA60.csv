Great Service,"The service was exceptional and the food was very good. Generally higher end pub food, the brussel sprouts and fries are really good and they do have some vegetarian options.

Great Service Reasonable Prices,"A nice rustic ambiance with a friendly staff who are very COVID aware, and the prices reasonable. There is a parking but it can get full quickly. The food varied from average to very good. I didn’t not care for the eggplant parmigiana, (a dish for me that separates the great Italian restaurant from the average) that being said many of the appetizers were very good and many of the other dishes good.

Delicious Pizza,"They have a small area where you can eat your pizza in the restaurant, however better for takeout. I usually am not the biggest fan of a thin crust pizza but this is an exception. Their pizza is excellent and may be one of the best pizzas we have had in a while. The sauce was good, the toppings delicious. There online ordering is easy to use and communication helpful and timely.

Not bad pizza,"Their menu is creative and has lots of options like a Portuguese Pizza. We aren’t far away but the food was cold when it got here. The wings were more like Turkey wings than chicken wings, the skin was crispy but the wings were tough and the honey mustard sauce kind of bland. The crust on the pizza was chewy, all in all despite having to microwave everything the food wasn’t bad. I would not rush to order from them again but they are worth a try.",February 2021,Lago Mar Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58277-d824462-Reviews-Lago_Mar_Pizza-Virginia_Beach_Virginia.html,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Great Fish and Chips,"Drove from VAB to Yorktown to try what were supposed to be the best fish and chips in Virginia. I don’t know if they are the best fish and chips in the state but they are very good. The portions are generous, and the prices reasonable. They have the choice between haddock and cod, I prefer the haddock. They give you a nice tartar sauce, malt vinegar and ketchup. A hole in the wall but worth a visit. They are also allergy aware and cook the fish separately from their shellfish.",December 2020,The Chipper,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60775-d13996733-Reviews-The_Chipper-Yorktown_Virginia.html,"Yorktown, Virginia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A small part of what you need to see,"The fort itself is not as important as the history behind it. The trail and historical markers are worth seeing the history itself is incredible. The fort itself is a small part of the overall experience, worth seeing but you need to take it all in including the obelisk marking where the fort originally stood.",November 2020,John Brown's Fort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60722-d10700606-Reviews-John_Brown_s_Fort-Harpers_Ferry_West_Virginia.html,"Harpers Ferry, West Virginia",attractions,2.0,4.0
A Beautiful Historic Hotel,"The hotel is named for Light Horse Harry Lee, revolutionary war general and father of Robert E. Lee. Reservations and check in are on line and you get a door code a day or two before you check in. There is ample parking behind the hotel. There are two sections to the hotel an older section built in the 1700’s and keep in mind that there are limits to why you can do to renovate as a result. The other side is newer and maybe a better choice for some, as tthey are newer, the bathrooms are nicer and they have their own thermostats. The historic side the thermostat is in the hall. The fire hall is not an issue as they don’t ring the siren after a certain time at night, but the road noise if you are on the Washington Street side can be loud. The bed is large and very comfortable.
Breakfast is included and may be the best hotel breakfast I have ever had. The chef in the morning Meaghan is very friendly and offers a lot of helpful suggestions. We felt COVID safe in the hotel and had no issues, there are a few things they could do to be a 5 star. A guide on how to operate the TV would help, if there is one we could not find it. The blind in our bathroom was broken and taped up, (replace it) the chandelier in the room was covered in cobwebs and needs dusting and the toilet has cobwebs in it too.
The hotel is well located and walking distance to Kelley’s Farm Kitchen and Hamilton’s Tavern.
I would definitely stay here again and recommend it.",November 2020,Light Horse Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60722-d7931178-Reviews-Light_Horse_Inn-Harpers_Ferry_West_Virginia.html,"Harpers Ferry, West Virginia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great Beer,"Park in the train station parking lot and walk up the stairs. They will not let you in because of COVID but there is seating on the patio they do take out. It can be cold and windy on the patio but they have heaters. The service is very good, the staff friendly and helpful. Their beer selection is exceptional and they are the best beer bar in Harpers Ferry. The food is good and the portions generous, a few more vegetarian options would be nice, I’m not a big portobello burger fan. As the chairs on the patio are metal and cold when it is cold if there is a COVID safe cushion it would be nice.
The condiments in a bowl would also be better than on the table.",November 2020,The Rabbit Hole Gastropub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60722-d17352884-Reviews-The_Rabbit_Hole_Gastropub-Harpers_Ferry_West_Virginia.html,"Harpers Ferry, West Virginia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Only BarBQ in the Area,"The service is good and the staff friendly, the ribs were very good, I didn’t try the pastrami but the brisket was only ok, the bread was stale, Texas Toast style white bread, it was somewhat average.

Great Beer,"I’m a fan boy of their beer, there is a lot of parking nearby but it is not well marked out. Their beer is amazing and there is a lot of space, it is an industrial ambiance like Reaver Beach in VAB, in fact they are quite similar. The music is not too loud which is a good thing as metal can get annoying after awhile.

A Great Place for Dinner,"There is parking in back and parking on the street, one thing that would have been nice to know before we got there is that they are bring your own for wine and beer, there is no mention of this on their website. They do not have a freezer or microwave so everything is farm to table. The service is good and the plating exceptional. The food is very good and the portions appropriate. The chef has a bit of a sweet tooth and some of the dishes were on the sweet side but had some savory elements to them. A pet peeve, especially in a fine dining restaurant is when they don’t change the cutlery between courses. The pace of service is a little between rushed and leisurely it could be a bit slower. All in all a very good restaurant and I would go back if in the area.",November 2020,Hamilton's Tavern 1840,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60722-d17652129-Reviews-Hamilton_s_Tavern_1840-Harpers_Ferry_West_Virginia.html,"Harpers Ferry, West Virginia",restaurants,4.0,4.5

My food was excellent, fresh and lots of flavor, my wife felt hers was good but very flavorful. There are tables both inside and outside. They are across from Baladi’s and the Cupcake Bakery. A few little things would have made it a 5, the tortilla chips that came with meal were stale and if you are going to serve tortilla chips then some salsa or guacamole would be welcomed.

Organized Confusion,"In all fairness I have eaten at Mod many times before and the food was ok. Last night because of the power outages they were incredibly busy.
Nothing irritates me more in a service establishment than being ignored, I stood waiting to place my order for almost 10 minutes and was ignored, the young man was busy preparing orders but it would have taken 10 seconds to say I will be with you ASAP I need to work on these orders. The food was also disappointing, I ordered two of the Dillon James Pizzas and they were supposed to have basil on them neither did, on one it tasted like they subbed cilantro for basil. If you are going to sub, you need to let me know, what if I was allergic to cilantro.
One pizza had a Mod (thin crust) and it was like eating burnt pita chips too crunchy and burnt. The food was not great, and the service a hot mess.

This is not a gourmet breakfast and not as upscale as the Bee and The Biscuit (or Chez Cora’s for the visitors from the North) but you have a lot of options and the portions are generous (you won’t leave hungry). They do put a ton of butter on the toast so ask for it unbuttered as there is butter on the table. The service was good and the food decent, the coffee was hot a bit on the weak side but fine.

I would definitely recommend the bread salad it is delicious with sprigs of fresh Rosemary, and the wines are moderately priced. One of the best restaurants I have been to in a while. They are small (in the summer they have a patio) reservations are a must and I recommend about 2 weeks out. They have a nice ambiance with a buzz of conversation but not excessively loud. In the winter if you have a table near the door or at the bar it can get cold when the door opens. Street parking nearby can be a challenge, I recommend parking at MacArthur Center, it is a 2 minute walk, they are open 24/7 and 5 hours parking will cost you about $3.00, worth it to avoid the aggravation of street parking.

Spectacular View,A beautiful drive along the coast from Athens to Sounion. You can see the temple of Poseidon on the cliff from a long way off. The temple itself is gorgeous and you can get quite close to it. There are great walking paths on the property that you can explore the views and see the temple from different vantage points. It is windy at the top of the cliff and it can be several degrees cooler than on the shore. The paths are gorgeous but the climb back up can be a bit steep. Well worth the drive and some of the private tours are a better way to go. Sunset at the temple would be gorgeous.

Our server Jazlyn was slammed, she had a private room and a section and it seemed as if the whole section was seated at the same time, despite that she kept her cool, was pleasant and provided excellent service.

A good airline until there’s a problem,"Flight DL 84 from Atlanta to Paris on November 15th was a Charlie Foxtrot. The flight was delayed by more than 3 hours. They couldn’t get the Auxiliary Power Unit to connect properly to the air craft. Stuff happens however the communication from Delta’s gate crew was less than ideal. They did not notify us of a delay until after the boarding time had come and gone, they started out with a 20 minute delay, then it was 15 more minutes, then 15 more minutes, etc., the app and flight tracker were a better source of information. When they finally got it working, we had to wait for the aircraft to warm up. Then we boarded and someone was sick all over the seats, needless to say the cleaning crew had to come on, however at no time did they tell us why we were delayed. They didn’t say anything until the cleaning crew were finished.
When we landed they had boarding passes for some of the delayed passengers but not all of the delayed passengers, so some of us had to get in line with Air France to get our boarding passes. They did give us a coupon for 15 Euros for food.
The communication from Delta left a lot to be desired. By time I arrive at my final destination I will have been traveling for 24 hrs.
Stuff happens and sometimes it is beyond the control of the airline, what separates the good from the bad is how they handle it. This brought back memories of why I had stopped flying Delta years ago. I started with Delta again because they are better than American and marginally better than United, however the way they handled this leaves me questioning that decision.",November 2019,Delta Air Lines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729060-Reviews-Delta-Air-Lines,World,flights,1.0,4.0
