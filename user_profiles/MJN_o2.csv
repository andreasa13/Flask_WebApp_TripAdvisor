Lovely stay!,"This hotel is extremely beautiful and the 6th floor is a great location.
We had a few hiccups- such as our TV not working but I couldn’t mark them down because the issue was resolved very quickly and complimentary drinks were provided.

The 6th floor can get very busy on the weekends, anyone is welcome to come up- the service drops because of the fact you can’t determine who’s from the hotel and who isn’t! But it’s understandable why people want to come and visit- perfect views and the drinks were lovely!

The breakfast was great, we picked from the small menu and had egg Benedict & avocado with a poached egg, was lovely!

The room was beautiful- the location was perfect- the breakfast was good- there was a section where they had free drinks 24-7.
This is up there with one of the best stays I’ve ever had.
We were going to the baths on the last day and they extended our room till 2pm free of charge.
You get a slip in your room where you can request an adapter- more pillows ect, I thought the whole service was great.
I will deffo return if I come back to Budapest!

Great experimce,"I recommend arriving early because around 11-12 in the afternoon it becomes very busy- the staff were helpful
We paid for our own changing room for 500 HUF more- worth it

Disappointed,"The staff were professional and took us to to our table, the place itself it’s very beautiful and I would recommend even going for a coffee for the experience.
I was disappointed with the food- we had sausage for starter and this was lovely however for main I ordered the penne pasta and it was a bowl of pasta in tomato sauce- no meat? Seasoning? We had two drinks each and the bill was 30,000 HUF- which is £82!!! We were totally shocked when the bill arrived! There was a service charge of 15% on the meal and the drinks.
I personally wouldn’t recommend for food- but I would for a drink!
I think it’s way to pricey and The food wasn’t to my taste",February 2019,New York Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274887-d970327-Reviews-New_York_Cafe-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",restaurants,3.0,4.0

GO- One of the best meals I’ve ever had,"We visited here on our last night.
The service was brilliant, the staff were really friendly and helpful.
It had a nice atmosphere with live musicians and the food was unbelievable, one of the best meals I’ve ever had ( I had chicken pancakes to start & the mascarpone pasta for main)
I highly recommend- if we ever return to Budapest we will be back!
We were so shocked how cheap the bill was- think it was just under mid 20’s (20,000) which was great value considering the level or service and food itself, we had a three course meal and 4 drinks!",February 2019,Aszu Etteem,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274887-d4284031-Reviews-Aszu_Etteem-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fab,"Lots of screens, only issue we faced was that you couldn’t stand at the bar if there wasn’t a table you weren’t allowed to stay, however we jumped on a table with someone else and don’t have any complaints!
We had some bar snacks which were nice and the drinks were a good price",February 2019,Champs PUB,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274887-d783758-Reviews-Champs_PUB-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",restaurants,4.0,3.5

Interesting,"It was an interesting museum and pretty cheap for access.
I did find it a little confusing, you can purchase some head phones which help explain each room but it was double the price.
Each room has a English print out which explains what each room is showing but some of them were 2 A4 pages, which was an effort to read.
I would recommend going if you’re looking for something to do, it wasn’t expensive so we don’t feel any type of way for going",February 2019,House of Terror Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274887-d325279-Reviews-House_of_Terror_Museum-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",attractions,3.0,4.0

Great!,"We came in for a late Sunday lunch- we hadn’t booked a table, we were told to sit at the bar and get a drink & he would try and get us a table! Within 5 minutes he got us a table!
The service was brilliant- I think he was called Jamie?

AWFUL SERVICE,"the Q was so big we were queuing outside, which is fine. However when we finally got inside to q, there was a table for 14 with empty plates & a empty table of four and the plates had not been cleared.

We waited for another 15 minutes and no one cleared these tables? The girls were just standing at the counter chatting.
Finally we got seated waited another length of time just for menu.

The menu had a make your own section which I thought was good idea! The food was good!

"Good food, awful service","You can’t pre book.. so we had to wait for 45 mins for a table!

The service was shocking but the food was fast and it was nice. We had drinks, mains and 2 sides and it was £15 a head! Which is great.

Personally wouldn’t return,"Came here for lunch, I don’t actually drink wine but if you did I would recommend coming for sure!
We had a 4 tapas starters and I have to say it was one of the worst I’ve ever had...
The main arrived I had risotto and my partner also had pasta but asked without mushrooms however it arrived with mushrooms and I had finished mine before his dish returned but we both said how lovely the main dish was!
The staff were ok..

I wanted a fry up but being the picky girl I am, I don’t like mushrooms, tomatoes, fried eggs or black pudding, she was so lovely that she basically made me my own special fry up including all the things I liked.
