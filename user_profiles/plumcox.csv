Interesting - and could do with a bigger building!,"What interesting exhibits! Timeline approach is very interesting, but with the constraints of the building it gets hard to see everything when it is even moderately crowded.

Calm space to enjoy,"Right in the middle of the tourist area, this is a great place to just soak up the atmosphere whilst looking at 'old stuff' (as my family term it!). I wouldn't go there instead of the Acropolis, but it's an interesting add on if you have time whilst you are in Athens.
The area has lots of good value souvenir shops (and some not such good value ones) and plenty to see.",February 2020,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Friendly Service, Good Food, a relaxed lunch","Very pleasant greeting by the restaurant manager, we were handed off to our server Scott, who was both friendly and entertaining!
We had a fab lunch - odd combinations of a side dish ordered as a starter and a a starter ordered as a main were all dealt with easily and well. Our varied party, spanning 60 years from the youngest to oldest, all chose dishes to suit. Vegetarian, diabetic, child-picky, all were catered for.
Delicious food, plenty of vegetables, good service that was attentive without being over the top. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and plan to return when we are back in Maidstone.
Many thanks to the team, especially Scott, who kept my autistic teenager engaged with the whole dining out process in the most charming way.",January 2020,Chiltern Hundreds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187056-d1503780-Reviews-Chiltern_Hundreds-Maidstone_Kent_England.html,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
