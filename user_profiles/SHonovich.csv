Nice lunch in Delphi,"We stopped into this restaurant for a late lunch after visiting the historic sites of Delphi.

Great day tour from Athens - totally worthwhile,"We had a great day trip to Delphi from Athens. We booked it through Get Your Guide and it was terrific! There were only 3 of us on the tour - my husband & I and one other woman. The driver/guide was very knowledgeable and explained the area as we drove to Delphi (about 2.5 hours). We stopped in a small village to take photos and take a walk around. When we got to Delphi, we had a museum guide lead us through the museum and the ancient site. It was an incredible experience! We really got a lot out of it. On the way back we went to the town of Delphi and had lunch. The ride to & from Delphi gave us incredible views of the mountains and the valleys looking down from the mountains. While it was a long day, it was fantastic!",October 2019,Delphi day tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d5568551-Reviews-Delphi_day_tour-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Very cool - don't miss it!,We were glad we got to see the Plaka as it lets you imagine what everyday life might have been like and you see the relationship between the Plaka and the Acropolis.

Incredible place - you can't see this stuff anywhere!,"We would have spent a lot more time in this museum if we had allocated enough time. It was later in the day when we got there, and it was very crowded (I can't imagine what it's like in the summer). The collection is amazing. It would have been good to have a tour but we could overhear some other tours and signage was pretty good. It's a very special place.

A do not miss - but planning ahead will help!,"The Acropolis is probably the #1 attraction in Athens. It's incredible - don't miss it. That being said, just remember that everyone goes there. Even though we were there near the end of October, it was PACKED. We did not arrive until after 10am. This was not smart. It is suggested to arrive very early or later in the day. That would have been wise. There is a lot of walking and climbing, and when it's very crowded, it is hard to navigate with so many people walking various speeds and many being very cautious on the rocky paths. Definitely bring water and if it's hot, bring a hat. Try to arrive as soon as possible and leave yourself a lot of time. Go up from the main entrance (we did not - we went from the side by the museum). If you can hire a guide, do that. We did not - and we would have learned more if we had.

Lovely dinner sitting by the beautiful old harbor!,"We had a wonderful dinner here on our first night in Chania. It was peaceful and romantic looking out on the harbor, the shops and restaurants, and feeling immersed in this old Venetian-style city. The food was delicious, bountiful and reasonable. The service was great. Would highly recommend.",October 2019,Palazzo Al Mare,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d4413133-Reviews-Palazzo_Al_Mare-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fabulous hotel - especially due to the service!!,"We stayed in Casa Delfino for 4 nights at the end of October. It is a truly unique experience with a feeling of being in Greece and Venice at the same time. Unusual architecture and a somewhat odd mix of modern and ancient in the rooms. Our room turned out to be two floors with the bedroom upstairs and the bathroom and living room downstairs. This was not ideal for us, especially after we hiked the Samaria Gorge and could barely walk the next few days. The steps up and down were a lot. Also the room could have had more space for clothing and definitely more places to hang towels in the bathroom.
We were blown away by the service. The front desk staff spent a huge amount of time trying to find some tours for us when the ones we had booked were cancelled (and they succeeded). They gave us great directions, got us breakfast boxes to go when we needed to leave for excursions earlier than the breakfast was served, and they did so much more. All of the restaurants where we had dinner were recommended by them and they were all excellent (and very reasonable)!
I would definitely recommend it!",October 2019,Casa Delfino Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189415-d250618-Reviews-Casa_Delfino_Hotel_Spa-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Dreamlike Experience,"We had a fabulous 3 nights at the Canaves Oia Hotel in late October. The hotel immerses you in Greek culture with the stunning Santorini architecture, a layout with a lot of privacy and a 2-room 'suite' with plenty of space, spectacular views, and service to rival anyplace I've been. The staff could not have been more warm, welcoming and helpful. They got us a rental car, drivers to various places, directions, restaurant recommendations, and much more. The food in the restaurant (especially the breakfast) was the best we had in Greece, and the view from our table was truly breathtaking. Since it was the very end of the season, the hotel was getting ready to close for the winter, and the dinner options were very limited, but the staff more than made up for it with their attentive service and charm. Highly recommend this place!!",October 2019,Canaves Oia Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482941-d228905-Reviews-Canaves_Oia_Hotel-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
"Great location, very good service, nice room.","We stayed at the Electra Palace for 4 nights in late October. It was recommended by friends who had stayed there and we saw many great reviews.
Overall we enjoyed it immensely. The location is A+++++. Easy to get anywhere, nestled in the middle of the Plaka with loads of shops and restaurants right nearby, and easy walk to the Acropolis and many other sites.
The rooftop restaurant was a huge plus for this hotel. We made reservations to have dinner there our first night, and we had a lovely table outdoors with great views of the Acropolis and the entire area. It was private and special. The food was fabulous and the service was outstanding. We enjoyed having breakfast in this lovely space several days. The breakfast was fine - prob. a standard Greek buffet breakfast. One disappointment which we found in all the hotels in Greece was that there was no place to just get free coffee before breakfast in the morning. There was a keurig type machine in the room but that does not provide for any milk, etc to add to the coffee. The bigger disappointment was that the hotel refused to pack us a breakfast bag or box to take when we had to leave early in the morning for day-long excursions before breakfast opened. A luxury hotel should be able to accommodate its guests in this way - particularly when breakfast is included in the room rate. The other hotels we stayed in in Greece were happy to do this. So many people have to leave early for day long excursions.
The front dest and door staff at the hotel were very customer-focused. They helped us with many things - directions, calling cabs, recommending restaurants, and more. They seemed willing to bend over backwards. We did have one very negative experience in this department. We were going to the home of a friend in the suburbs and asked them to get us a cab. They said no problem and the cost would be 10 - 15 Euros and take about 15-20 min. .They called someone they seemed to know, a car service. The driver took the highway, packed with rush hour traffic. He was miserable, complaining all the way. He charged us 25 Euros and it took 30 min. For the way home we called a basic cab, who charged us 15 Euros and took 15 min, We were not happy about this experience.
The room was ok. The room itself was pretty nice, with plenty of space, storage, etc.
We were disappointed with the location of the room. We booked the hotel at least 4-5 months in advance, for what we were told was off-season. However we got probably one of the least desirable rooms. It was on the 2nd floor in a space where the building turned, so we had absolutely no view whatsover. This was a disappointment. It had no real sunlight since it was on the 2nd floor facing a courtyard,
Overall I do recommend the hotel highly. The building is very nice - lobby, rooms, dining etc. The location is great. The staff was guest focused. I would take care to be specific about a room request - esp. if booking well in advance.",October 2019,Electra Palace Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228901-Reviews-Electra_Palace_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Perfect, memorable lunch!","We stopped in here for lunch on the day we had driven up to this area to explore. Upon entering, we found ourselves in a cozy, inviting space. We had read that the seafood soup was awesome, and as we looked around, we could see almost everyone eating it!3 of the 5 of us ordered the seafood soup, and the other two shared a huge bowl of mussels. The soups arrived overflowing with seafood including mussels, shrimp and scallops. The mussels dish was easily enough for two for lunch. Everything was delicious.
The soup is available in two sizes but apparently the bowls are the same size and the difference is the amount of seafood in each. Honestly, I found the small size to have more than enough seafood.
The staff here was attentive and despite the restaurant being quite crowded with a large group, service was quick and great.
We will always remember our visit here and highly recommend it.",June 2017,Narfeyrarstofa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189983-d1541703-Reviews-Narfeyrarstofa-Stykkisholmur_West_Region.html,"Stykkisholmur, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Worth the stop when you are in this region!,"We had read about Helgafell online so we were looking out for the turn on the road. It was a lot closer to Stykkisholmur than we expected - just minutes away. We had read the story about the place and wanted to check it out.
The climb up to the top was a bit more strenuous than we thought it would be. The 'mountain' looks very small but the path is a bit steep and quite rocky. Once you reach the peak, the views are awesome!
It's a fun stop on your road trip, and you can do it in 30 minutes or linger longer if you like.",June 2017,Helgafell,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189983-d312359-Reviews-Helgafell-Stykkisholmur_West_Region.html,"Stykkisholmur, Iceland",attractions,5.0,4.0
Viking Sushi Boat - Awesome experience we will never forget!,"We read about the Viking Sushi Boat tour online and were skeptical, thinking it might be overly touristy. However, we decided to book it for our day trip up to Stykkisholmur. We were NOT disappointed!
There were 2 tour options and we booked the later (afternoon) one as we weren't sure what time we'd arrive. This one was shorter than the morning one (80 min. vs. 2 hours). We arrived quite early and tried to get on the earlier one but it had just left. That turned out to be a blessing. Apparently the earlier boat was filled with multiple bus tour groups. We wandered around the small, quaint town and had lunch. When we arrived for the tour, it took awhile for them to unload the one before us.
Then, we boarded. It's a very large boat - which can probably hold at least 100 people or more. There were 7 of us, plus the crew (several people), on our tour! It was like a private tour. We were incredibly lucky with this.
The boat went out around several islands, and we saw a lot of birds. We saw some puffins, but this boat is large and cannot get close to them. We had seen puffins from a small boat we took from Reyjkavik that was able to get much closer. If your primary goal is to see puffins, I would not suggest this as the best bet, as you may be disappointed.
We were on the boat on a beautiful day, and really enjoyed seeing the birds, islands, awesome views of snow-capped glaciers, and more. After awhile, the crew dropped the net to trawl for shellfish. Everyone was very excited when they pulled it in and lowered it onto a platform. Tons of shellfish came tumbling out - urchins of many colors and sizes, scallops, crabs, starfish, and more. The crew got to work opening up various shellfish and allowing people to help themselves. There was ginger, soy sauce and wasabi to go along with it. My family, which included my kids (22 and 25 years old), LOVED this experience. They will truly never forget it. It was one of the high points of our Iceland trip. It was not cheap, but we definitely got their fill of the freshest sushi anyone could ever want, along with a wonderful, scenic boat ride.
I would recommend this trip to anyone - and try if you can to go in the afternoon as it may be less crowded, which made a big difference.",June 2017,Seatours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189983-d736390-Reviews-Seatours-Stykkisholmur_West_Region.html,"Stykkisholmur, Iceland",attractions,5.0,4.0
"Outstanding! Wonderful, helpful, informative!","THANK YOU, I Heart Reyjkavik, for all the help you gave us in making our trip to Iceland so amazing!!!

These fabulous people helped us in so many ways as we planned our trip. We booked a walking tour with them about a month or 2 ahead of time. They became the only people we knew to contact with questions about our trip. I emailed them frequently with many questions, and they patiently answered every one.

They booked a puffin tour for us (using Special Tours, their recommendation, which was awesome), they booked a 9 hour private Super Jeep tour of the Golden Circle for us, and then when I wanted to add on snowmobiling, they took care of that, too. All of this was done for the same prices I would have paid if I'd done it on my own, but without my having to do it. They sent us confirmations, told us where to be, what to wear and bring, and everything else. It was WONDERFUL.

The walking tour of Reyjkavik was the icing on the cake. Our guide was Olof, and she was delightful. We did not take this tour on our first day in Iceland due to some logistics. That worked out well for us, but if you are not going to the Blue Lagoon on your first day, this would be a great thing to do. We had already explored Reyjkavik a bit before we took the tour, but we did not feel anything was repetitive.

The tour consisted of the 5 of us and 2 others, so it was small and we were all able to hear, see, ask lots of questions, and move along easily. Olof led us through the streets and neighborhoods. We stopped often along the way, with as much time as we needed to look around. We saw an assortment of historic sites, neighborhoods, interesting shops and restaurants, street art, and more. Olof talked about the history and culture of Reykjavik (and Iceland). We learned so much - most of which I'm sure we would not have learned anywhere else on our trip. Later in our trip we went back to many of the places she pointed out (including eateries). We thoroughly enjoyed chatting with her and hearing her stories. The tour left a lasting impression on us, a great memory of Iceland for us to have forever!",June 2017,I Heart Reykjavík,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189970-d6456477-Reviews-I_Heart_Reykjavik-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",attractions,5.0,5.0
Perfect quick lunch,"We were looking for a quick and 'less expensive' (doesn't exist in Iceland) place for lunch. Durum fit the bill as much as possible in Reyjkavik. They have a decent menu - salads, sandwiches, pizzas, soup. You order at the counter and they bring it to you. It's a small place - not a lot of tables but there were enough. Most of us enjoyed our sandwiches, which were like wraps, but heated so the 'wrap' was warm and crispy. We happened to notice that the people sitting next to us ordered a seafood pizza, and it looked AMAZING. Had we seen it before ordering,we definitely would have tried one!",June 2017,Durum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d3932680-Reviews-Durum-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great experience!,"We had dinner at Snaps on our first evening in Iceland, at the suggestion of friends. We had made a reservation in advance, via email. Snaps is very popular so I recommend making a reservation. It was perfect. It had been a long day, arriving early in the morning on a red-eye and packing in a lot of activity. As soon as we entered Snaps, we felt relaxed by the warm, inviting atmosphere. It has a very homey feel, with plants all around and cozy tables. The staff were very welcoming and attentive. We all enjoyed our food, although the fish was much better than the lamb. I would highly recommend a visit to Snaps for a memorable dinner in Iceland!",June 2017,Snaps Bistro Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d2621779-Reviews-Snaps_Bistro_Bar-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Fabulous ice cream!,"We stumbled into Joylato one evening after dinner, and when we saw that they make the ice cream right in front of you, we could not resist it. We ordered the chocolate, salted caramel, and mango. Each one was delicious. It is a slow process for them to make each ice cream individually, so it takes a lot longer than another ice cream place. However, it was worth it. It's a unique experience and product, and worth a visit!",June 2017,Joylato,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d9681349-Reviews-Joylato-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good ice cream but nothing special,"We had read rave reviews of Valdis so we headed over there one evening. They have a large selection of flavors, which is good. However, the taste of the ice cream was nothing special. It was like a basic American ice cream shop - although not quite as good. There were a few unique flavors, like Banana Skyr and Licorice, but most of the others were standard American flavors. We did not see that many ice cream places in Iceland, so if you are looking for ice cream (which we were), this place will do the trick for sure. Just don't expect to be blown away by it.",June 2017,Valdis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d6786772-Reviews-Valdis-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Overrated,"It's a hot dog, and not a very good one. Everyone said we had to go here, so we did. The hot dogs are very thin and I think they put a lot of toppings on it to mask the fact that the hot dog itself does not have that much flavor. It will not set you back much - they are only about $2.50 each. So if you are curious, go ahead. But don't go out of your way for this in Iceland.",June 2017,Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d1852122-Reviews-Baejarins_Beztu_Pylsur-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Overrated,"We made a reservation at Resto a few weeks before heading to the US from Iceland, based on others' recommendations. We drove to the restaurant as it is a bit further from the central area of Reykavik and would have been almost a 30 minute walk. There was plenty of parking nearby.
We were there on a Tuesday evening. The restaurant is small but was not crowded. We did not need a reservation. There were only about 4 tables occupied that evening.
The menu is quite limited (which we seemed to find true in most places we went). All of the food we had was really good, although not amazing.
The service, however, was poor. We literally felt ignored several times had to get up from our table to go ask for service to get more water, our bill, etc. We could see the staff hanging out in one area of the restaurant,chatting, with their backs to us all night.
It took about 30 minutes for us to get our food once we ordered, and during that time we never saw a waiter/waitress. We found this very disappointing, particularly for a place which has rave reviews online. A great restaurant needs to have more than just good food. It needs to provide an outstanding experience, which means attentive service. This one fell short for us.",June 2017,Resto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d7281803-Reviews-Resto-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Great view of the city,"Don't forget to stop into Hallgrimskirkja when you are in Reykjavik. Admission to the church is free and it's quite beautiful inside. For a small price, you can take an elevator to the top, where you will get a great view of Reykjavik.

We enjoyed it.",June 2017,Te & Kaffi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d8099727-Reviews-Te_Kaffi-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
An unforgettable experience,"We opted to visit the Blue Lagoon upon arrival in Iceland. Our flight was scheduled to land at 6:10am and we could not check into our accommodations in Reyjkavik until 2:00pm, so we figured it would be a good way to spend several hours (we rented a car so we had a place to store our luggage). We were very glad we opted to go there at the beginning of the trip. I would not have wanted to go on the way home, as for me it would not have been relaxing.

We pre-booked the 8:00 am time slot, which means you need to arrive between 8-9. Our flight arrived a bit late and it took awhile to get the car, so we got there around 8:30, which was fine. I highly recommend going this early in the morning. There were already a lot of people there although it did not feel overly crowded. However, by 11:00 it was packed in the locker rooms, lobby and other spaces other than the lagoon itself.
If you do not pre-book, you may not be able to visit when you want to. We booked it a few weeks in advance, and at that point, many time slots (like 9, 10 and 11am) were already booked. Also - the prices go up as the date nears, so the further in advance you book it, the better your price will be. We ended up having to pay more because we waited until about 3 weeks before the date we wanted (in peak season - June).

One thing you may not hear too much about the Blue Lagoon on the negative side is the extreme sulphur smell you will encounter. This is very nauseating for some people, but if you are going to Iceland, you need to get used to it, because you will smell it in the hot water everywhere. We even had it in the apartment we rented. If you can overlook this, you should have a great time at the Blue Lagoon. Even though it is very touristy and is man-made, it is a great experience. The water is warm, there is a lot of space, you can explore the waterfall, swim-up bar, and other areas. It is very relaxing. The facilities are clean and nice - showers, plenty of lotion, conditioner, lockers, towels, bags for your wet bathing suit, hair dryers, and attentive staff. You can show up with your bathing suit and you don't need much else. You can take your phone into the lagoon and take pictures but there is no place to leave it on the side - you have to get out and put it back in your locker. Many people had theirs with them - some in plastic bags or cases and some just taking chances as you don't want to miss the photo opportunities.
Overall it's a very fun relaxing experience and we would have really regretted missing it.",June 2017,Blue Lagoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608874-d207805-Reviews-Blue_Lagoon-Grindavik_Reykjanes_Peninsula.html,"Grindavik, Iceland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great last meal in Iceland!,"We visited Bryggjan for a quick meal on our way to the airport at the end of our vacation. I wish we had gone there on the first day, after the Blue Lagoon. It is only about 10 minutes from the Blue Lagoon.
We all (5 of us) had the Lobster Soup, which was about $20 per person (this is extremely cheap by Iceland standards). It was an especially good value because that included UNLIMITED soup - Lobster Soup and/or the soup of the day which was vegetable, bread and butter, coffee and water. We each had about 2 bowls of delicious Lobster Soup.
This place is very small and quaint, right by the water. The people who run it are warm and friendly. You order at the counter and serve yourself the food, so it's quick if you need to get in and out.
The menu is limited, so if you don't want soup, you may not want to eat here. They do have coffee and some cakes, so it's a good stop for that. For lunch, other than the soup, there were a few open-faced sandwiches. However, for us the soup was perfect!",June 2017,Bryggjan Grindavik,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608874-d2264342-Reviews-Bryggjan_Grindavik-Grindavik_Reykjanes_Peninsula.html,"Grindavik, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
An overlooked gem in NYC,"I've been to the NY historical society a few times and never stop being amazed by how wonderful it is. They always have some outstanding temporary exhibits, and also have a great film about the history of New York City and a permanent art collection that is terrific. You can come here for an hour or two and see a lot. You will leave feeling even more inspired by how incredible New York City is. This is an easy place to visit, without big crowds. I recommend it highly to tourists as well as residents who have never been there.

The rooms were ok, the service was ok, there was not a lot of noise, which is good, and you might get some great views from this hotel.

Good choice in Montauk,"We have now stayed in both the Ocean Resort Inn and the Aqualina Inn - sister properties adjacent to each other. They are in a perfect location with easy access to everything in Montauk. It's a very short walk to the beach, shops and restaurants, and a short drive to everything else. They are both very clean, nicely furnished, comfortable beds, basic amenities. The rates are very reasonable (both of our visits were during 'shoulder' season - early June and late September). It is hard to distinguish between the 2 on the websites. In general we found the Ocean Resort Inn a better choice than the Aqualina. The rooms were larger and more comfortable. We found our King balcony room at the Aqualina to be tiny and cramped. We had a hard time sleeping because they have bright lights outside each room that are left on all night. The bed is very close to the sliding door that the light shines into the room despite the curtains. We did not have this problem at the property next door. However, it was still a good place to stay, given the cleanliness, the rates, and the great location.",September 2016,Aqualina Inn Montauk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g48194-d8649938-Reviews-Aqualina_Inn_Montauk-Montauk_Long_Island_New_York.html,"Montauk, New York",hotels,4.0,5.0
Great for a short warm-weather getaway,"We booked this hotel (which I'd be more likely to call a motel) last minute for one night (weeknight) for a quick trip to Montauk to visit someone. We read the reviews first, and found that the hotel lived up to the reviews. It is very basic - I think the word 'Resort' in the title is not truly appropriate. However, it is clean, well-furnished and well-maintained and in a great location. The staff were hospitable and helpful. You can walk all over the place from this location - restaurants, beach, shops, parks, etc. It's great not to have to drive everywhere. The grounds are nicely kept and the hotel has beach towels, beach chairs, umbrellas, bikes, etc for your use for free, which is great. The rooms had small touches such as some free bottled water and nice amenities, which show the care the staff puts into it. The rates we paid were quite reasonable. We were on the 2nd floor. If you are on the 1st floor you may not be able to keep your window coverings open at all or people will be looking right into your room. This would not be good, in my opinion. We were in the suite on the end, which was spacious and nice.",June 2016,The Ocean Resort Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g48194-d275198-Reviews-The_Ocean_Resort_Inn-Montauk_Long_Island_New_York.html,"Montauk, New York",hotels,5.0,4.5

Decent place for a family dinner,"We've eaten in Lidia's restaurants in NYC so decided to try this when we were visiting our daughter in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is large and lovely inside. The one wall of high windows provides some nice views. The service was fairly good. Our waitress was attentive and engaging, but it was still hard to get her sometimes when we needed her. The menu and the food at Lidia's was really 'just ok' - not amazing my any means. We are foodies and eat a lot of Italian food, and this did not impress us at all. The only really awesome thing was the kale salad, which was terrific. We had the pasta special (3 types of pasta - only 1 of which was good), the lamb and the cioppino. None were particularly memorable. The prices were reasonable overall. We were glad we tried it, but would not be likely to return.",March 2016,Lidia's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g53449-d400941-Reviews-Lidia_s-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Awesome brunch - lived up to the reputation,"We went to Coca Cafe for Easter brunch. We called the day before and were advised to use the app to put our name in ahead of time. That saved us! We had heard they have very long waits and no place to wait, but thanks to using that app, we only had to wait about 15 minutes (outside - the weather was good) when we arrived and checked in. I recommend you check in even if the app hasn't notified you that your table is ready. This may work in your favor of your position in the queue.

We had heard the food at Coca Cafe is amazing, and it did not disappoint at all. There was a great selection of sweet and savory breakfast items as well as plenty of lunch/dinner foods. Easter brunch also included a pastry plate with an assortment of about 4 or 5 different miniature freshly made sweets like scones and banana bread - all delicious! We each loved what we ordered - eggs benedict, mushroom frittata, veggie hash, and cioppino, and the portions were very large.

We had a very nice, attentive waiter. He seemed to want to go out of his way to be helpful and accomodating. Oddly, he made several big errors serving us, which is why I can't provide a 5 star rating. The food took quite awhile to come, and when it did, he the 2 of us who ordered eggs benedict got the wrong dish - a 'fried eggplant benedict' instead. He insisted this was the only benedict on the menu, and argued with us that we were wrong and this is what we ordered. I had to ask him to get us a menu to point out to him the 2 different benedicts on the menu and insist we did not order something called 'fried.' He should not have disputed what we were saying. He did apologize, but we still had to wait for new dishes, after already waiting quite awhile. The new plates came out in a reasonable time and we loved them. Then, when we got the bill, he actually had an additional entree on the bill that we did not have! There were 5 of us, and our bill had 6 entrees. This makes me highly suspicious of what was going on. When we pointed this out, he removed it (of course) - but really offered no explanation. I would have thought that after the error with the wrong dish for 2 people, and then the addition of a phantom $20 item on our bill, they would have done something to compensate us and assure our future trust, but they did not.

That being said, the food was amazing, and we will return, but we will be cautious with our ordering and reading the bill.",March 2016,Coca Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g53449-d3732494-Reviews-Coca_Cafe-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great food but...,"We LOVE the food at El Vez. Lunch, dinner, drinks, etc - all excellent.
Unfortunately, the other pains we have to endure to eat there are becoming a major hindrance. The noise and cramped tables were always an issue (earplugs are a must - do not expect to have conversation with a group), but the attitude and poor service have put me over the top. They seem to play all kinds of games with their reservation and seating policy. On a recent monday night we were unable to secure a reservation days in advance for a party of 8, and then we had to wait over an hour at 6:30pm. We were finally escorted to a booth made to comfortable fit 5 (and there was a stroller adjacent to it, cutting into the space), when lo and behold, we saw 3 other large tables open (but were denied the option to sit at one of them). The wait staff was rude and inattentive from the get go. We were celebrating a birthday - and they never even asked us if we wanted to order dessert! Too bad - because we really did plan to order dessert, if only we could have tracked down someone to help us!

Great place to stop in for lunch,"It's hard to find an inexpensive place for lunch in this neighborhood where you can actually sit down. There are plenty of food trucks and places to run in and grab a salad to go, or else there are expensive restaurants, but not much in-between. We wandered into this Barilla Restaurant after seeing people eating salads and gourmet pizzas through the window. It was perfect!
You wait in line and order your food, take a seat, and they bring the food to you. I would not say it's 'fast' - they are clearly making the food fresh. The menu has a nice assortment of salads, soups, panini, pizza, pastas, and more. The pastas looked fresh and fabulous, although we did not have any. We had a salad and the Nobile pizza, which had prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula, blue cheese and parmesan. Both were delicious. The prices were very reasonable. The pizzas come in 2 sizes - individual or for sharing. We got the individual size, and it was more than one of us could eat for lunch.
You can sit and linger as long as you want, which is great when you are walking around the city a lot.
We will definitely return here.",December 2015,Casa Barilla,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d5617483-Reviews-Casa_Barilla-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Ok food and prices,This place is a 'chain' - they have several restaurants. It seems like they cater to families and we did not have any kids with us.

"Food ok, service not great","This was recommended to us by our hotel when we were looking for something close by for dinner. It's on a very quiet street, out of the way, not at all touristy. The host (owner?) was not friendly when we entered. The place was not too crowded, but apparently all the tables in the back room (which was much nicer and more spacious) were 'reserved' - and in fact they did fill up quickly. So we were seated in a very tight space leading to the bigger room. The menu was basic traditional food - not too diverse. The prices were reasonable. Our issue was this 'gentleman' was brusque and never made us feel comfortable. He seemed to be running out back to smoke and then he'd come our table to take our order, reeking of cigarettes, which was not pleasant at all. The food was ok - not as good as we had at other places in Vienna.

On a weeknight, it quickly filled up with what appeared to be locals coming for dinner after work. The place is very modern and spacious. The service was warm and welcoming. The menu was pretty basic Austrian food - not a huge variety, but more than at many other places. Our waiter had a great sense of humor and joked around with us. My mom and I each got the Wiener Schnitzel, which we wished we had decided to share, because it was ENORMOUS. It was served with a potato salad that was the best we had ever had. My mom wanted to see if she could get the recipe or find out what made it taste so good, and the waiter told us they actually sell a cookbook (they were out of them that night - but we were able to find it at their other restaurant around the corner). The prices were very reasonable. If the menu had been slightly more diverse, we would have returned a 2nd time in our 3 nights in Vienna.

Decent boutique hotel in a great location,"We spent 3 nights here in October. It was not among our first choices, which were booked. We did not take the non-refundable rate, as we were worried about possibly having to cancel. The rate we got was not a great value - it was fairly high considering the accomodations, but there were many excellent things about this hotel, along with some compromises.

The hotel is in a great location - on a small, quiet, dead-end street, but very close to the Ringstrasse near Schwedenplatz, very close to Stephansplatz, walking distance to almost everything. We walked easily to most major areas of the city from here, and also took the tram, as we could get to the tram stop in just a few minutes. There is a lot of great shopping and restaurants very nearby, and a supermarket across the street. I would definitely recommend this for the location.

The interior is beautifully decorated and quaint. The service was excellent. We had emailed ahead of time and the staff helped us get great tickets for a sold-out opera. They were very helpful with good restaurant recommendations, directions, and much more.

The breakfast was decent - nothing special by European standards- just the basic bread, cheese, eggs, etc. Breakfast is served in a space that looks very nice, but that is much smaller than what they need when the hotel is busy. People were bumping into each other, tripping over each other, and the food is all crammed into a corner and very hard to reach when others are there. It takes a long time to get to the food and to get a cup of coffee. They really need a better set-up for this.

The rooms were ok. They (we had 3 people/2 rooms) are definitely on the small side - especially for what we were paying. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was ok - hard to use the shower. We had to wait forever to get hot water in the morning, and the temperature was hard to control. Our room looked out over the front of the hotel, and there was a TON of noise at night which we could hear clearly, although we were on the 5th floor. We could hear people partying, garbage being emptied in the wee hours, etc.

We were on the 5th floor, and having the lounge on that floor was a real treat - especially since we were in 2 rooms and when we wanted to get together we could go to the lounge. It was great.",October 2015,Hotel Kaerntnerhof Velden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g641727-d638285-Reviews-Hotel_Kaerntnerhof_Velden-Velden_am_Woerthersee_Carinthia_Austrian_Alps.html,"Velden am Woerthersee, Austria",hotels,4.0,4.0

"If it sounds too good to be true, it is!","We stayed at this Hyatt House for 3 nights last week while moving our daughter into an apartment nearby. We had been told about the opening of this hotel and had immediately looked it up online. We were blown away by the language describing the hotel - especially about the warm, welcoming atmosphere they seemed intent on creating. We were very excited about staying there, with the many amenities they touted, like the breakfast and shuttle bus, great location, suite layout,and overall service.

Sadly, we were extremely disappointed in the hotel. The 2 star rating here is a reflection of the hotel's failure to meet our expectations - particularly when it comes to guest service/hospitality.

At no time in the hotel did we find the service to be what we expect when we travel. This was the biggest problem by far. At check-in, the woman we dealt with gave no explanation of the hotel and how it works, even though there are various things (related to their focus on environmental conservation) which are confusing if you have not experienced them before (like the lights and air conditioner not going on unless you leave your key in a slot inside). The staff mostly did not wear name badges and had very sloppy, oversized 'uniforms,' so it was hard to actually identify the employees. It was extremely hard to find staff to help, and when we did, they often did not have answers to our basic questions. The hotel seemed as if it had opened the day before and did not have their act together, and was not focused on the guest (they had been opened for at leas 6 weeks, I believe).

The hotel was packed to capacity at least the first night we were there, and they seemed overwhelmed. The breakfast area was chaos. Their literature goes on about the made-to-order omelettes, but with one person covering the entire operation and only able to make 3 omelettes at a time, the wait for an omelette (and they are VERY SMALL omelettes) was more than 10 minutes. We could not find help in the breakfast area at any time when we tried. Our toast got stuck in the machine and we spent 5 minutes hunting for someone to fix it, to no avail. The fruit was a combination of canned fruit and fresh fruit mixed together in one bowl, which is a huge turnoff to me. Overall, the selection for breakfast was mediocre relative to my experience with other hotels like this that have breakfast (like Hampton Inn).

We had reserved a King Suite because we were not sure how many nights our daughter would stay with us before her apartment was set up for her to stay there. This was the only room type that had a living room with a sofa bed separated by a door from the bedroom. The layout of the suite was extremely strange, with the emphasis of space being given to the kitchen (??). Our room was at the end of the hall. Unfortunately, the bathroom was inside the bedroom, rather than accessible from the living room as it should be in a suite, so our daughter had to enter our bedroom to use the bathroom. The air conditioning unit was also in the bedroom, and all the way in one corner so it blew directly onto one end of the bed. Basically, there was no cool air circulating into the kitchen or living room, so there was a huge temperature discrepancy between the areas. It was impossible to maintain a comfortable temperature in the room - one of the worst temp. control situations I have ever seen in a hotel.

This hotel sits right on Baum, a major street. The rooms are literally just a few feet off the street (on that side of the hotel). Our room was on the 2nd floor on the end of the hall. This turned out to basically be right over the major intersection of streets near the hotel, which has an audio at the crosswalk telling people when it's safe to walk. This kept us up a lot starting around 5am every day - very loud, right under the bedroom!

A few times we tried to use the shuttle bus. The literature makes it sound like it will be very easy to use. But we were told it only leaves the hotel once an hour, and you have to make a reservation. So it turned out to not be easy or helpful at all.

We encountered numerous other issues throughout our stay. Many were small, but they kept adding up. If we had once found an employee who really seemed interested in helping us out, it would have been completely different, but we did not. These employees were totally disengaged. We tried to find a manager, and failed.

The hotel facility seems like it has some potential, and the location is good. We will probably try the Marriott Courtyard across the street next time for comparison, and then see which we prefer.",August 2015,Hyatt House Pittsburgh / Bloomfield / Shadyside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g53449-d7391686-Reviews-Hyatt_House_Pittsburgh_Bloomfield_Shadyside-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",hotels,2.0,4.5
exceeds expectations,"We booked a night here as part of a road trip we had to make. We generally prefer Hampton Inns when we are looking for a lower-priced place for a night on the road, as they tend to be somewhat consistent, clean, and have a nice breakfast. I was a bit worried when we pulled into this one, as I saw it is right along the highway and was worried about noise. Fortunately, noise was not a problem here at all. We had bombed a suite since we had our older daughter travelling with us. There was a bedroom and a living room with a sofa bed the rooms and bathroom were large and clean. The living room had a nice little kitchen area. The suite was very comfortable for all of us. The service at this hotel was fabulous. I hope the folks at the parent office will visit here and see what a wonderful job the staff is doing at providing true hospitality. Every employee we met at the front desk, in the breakfast area, etc went above and beyond to be friendly and helpful. The room and the public areas were clean and welcoming.

Worth it for the view alone!,"We were visiting Pittsburgh dropping off kids at school, and came here because we heard it was a good place to view the city. We had never been up to this area before and knew very little about the city. I read a lot of reviews online, and many of them were not good, so I was afraid the experience was going to be disappointing. IT WAS NOT! The view alone from this restaurant is spectacular. As we drove up to the area, it seemed very run-down, and I was glad we had not decided to eat at one of the more expensive restaurants there. When we entered the Grandview Saloon, it looked much more casual than I was expecting. Much of the seating is actually on a huge deck. We had called and made a reservation, and had requested a table with a view. We had not specifically requested a table outside, and they did not have one (it was a sunday after a home pre-season football game), but the did give us an indoor table at the window with an amazing view. The menu was very diverse, and I think as long as you stick to the basics, the food is pretty good. It was reasonably priced, although the reviews I had read had said it's overpriced. We did not think that was true. Most of us had burgers, sandwiches or salads. The portion sizes were generous and the food was good. The service was extremely slow, and we actually had a time constraint. But I thought perhaps they just give you time to enjoy the view - which is nice!

Great addition to Margate,"We were excited when Shuckers opened in Margate (last year?) and had a good first visit there. We just returned again recently and had a great dinner. We arrived around 5:45pm on a sunday and did not have to wait for an inside table (they don't take reservations). They said it would be 25 minutes for an outside table - although it seemed like a few were vacant. By the time we left, a little after 7, the place was packed and it was a 45 minute wait. We had great service and enjoyed our food. We ordered a pitcher of their sangria (white) - delicious. Among the 3 of us, we had a soup, a salad, a few appetizer plates (mussels and stuffed clams - which one person ate as main course), friend shrimp, and the lobster roll.

Good first night dinner in Prague,"This was recommended by our hotel for our first night in Prague. We wanted Czech food close by. The menu offered a good variety. We were a bit turned off by some of the American entrees on the menu like hamburgers, but there seemed to be plenty of Czech offerings. The food we ordered was pretty good. The bulgarian salad was particularly delicious. The prices were good. The atmosphere was more modern. We later learned this is a chain, targeted toward being family-friendly, which seemed to fit our impression. Had we known that, we probably would not have eaten there, but we were pleased with it all nonetheless.",October 2014,Potrefena Husa Vinohrady,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d6591608-Reviews-Potrefena_Husa_Vinohrady-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",restaurants,4.0,4.0
So-so,"We ate here our last night in Prague, and it was disappointing. It was recommended as a great place to get authentic Czech food. The menu had many Czech specialties - lots and lots of meat, but we felt the quality and flavor was very average relative to the other places we ate during our stay. I tried the ghoulish and dumplings, and while there was lots of sauce, it really had no flavor. We ate in the non-smoking section, which is downstairs and does not have as much atmosphere as upstairs. It is probably geared more towards tourists - lots of large tables able to accommodate groups. The service was decent. There are a lot of better places to eat that are less commercial.",November 2014,Kolkovna Celnice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d694912-Reviews-Kolkovna_Celnice-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",restaurants,3.0,4.0
A Hidden treasure,"We were brought here by our friend, who lives in Prague. Otherwise, we never would have known about it or seen it, as it's quite hidden. But we're so glad we did. We had a wonderful dining experience here. We came for lunch and did not plan to eat much. The menu offered a variety of czech specialties. We had some appetizers, one soup and one entre, plus beer. Everything was delicious with lots of flavor. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable and the prices were very reasonable. We would definitely recommend it.",November 2014,Kyvadlo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d2248815-Reviews-Kyvadlo-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Go for the view,"This was highly recommended to us by a friend as a 'must do' for the view of the city at night. Having read some of the other reviews of Nebozizek, I agree with many of the positives and negatives. We had a hard time getting there because we tried to take a cab who could not figure out how to get up the hill even though he called for directions. He left us off half way and we then had to walk up. It would have been best to have taken the funicular. I agree that the view is spectacular and is worth doing. However, it probably would have been a better visit at a different time of year, when we could dine outdoors and perhaps be there for sunset to experience daylight and dark. The restaurant has a lot of outdoor seating and very little indoor seating. It also does not have a nonsmoking section (or did not appear to). Since it's small, just a few smokers can make it very unpleasant (and did). The service was not so great - the waiter was quite haughty in his tone toward us, and disappeared for long periods of time. The food was very good though, and we felt the prices were not so bad considering the location and view. You would expect to pay more for a place like this, and we did, but it was still a bargain by comparison to anything in the USA. I'm sure if we were to do it again, we would still go there, but we would take public transportation.",November 2014,Restaurant Nebozizek,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d1027079-Reviews-Restaurant_Nebozizek-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Poor experience,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom 'villa' for 3 nights. It was spacious, but not nice.

The biggest issue we had here was with the service, which continued to amaze us at how terrible it was. First of all, they are trying to sell you on buying a timeshare at every possible moment. They weave the language into every encounter they have with you. As an example, even when we went to purchase tickets to Disneyland from the concierge, they dangled 'an extra discount' if you go through their sales pitch. It sets a tone of making you uncomfortable from the get go.

On the first morning, I went to the lobby to check out a few things. As I exited my room, I encountered what appeared to be a large pile of dog poop right in the middle of the concrete walkway. It was horrible. I reported this immediately to the only staff person I could find in the lobby. He said he would have housekeeping take care of it right away. When I returned to my room about 20 minutes later, it was still there! I called down to housekeeping, and told them about it. Someone finally came up and banged on our door, asking what our problem was (in a nasty tone). When I looked outside, I could see that it had just been cleaned up, but it was appalling to have 1) seen it in the first place and 2) have had to report it 2x to be taken care of.

We returned to our room after 3pm after our first night and full day there, to find that it still had not been made up. We were going out early that night and needed to shower. We walked through the entire resort, encountering many housekeeping service carts but had trouble finding someone actually from housekeeping. When I finally did, I asked about getting the room made up. This person went into a whole story about how they had been called in early because other staff had not shown up, and there was just no way to get the rooms done in time. I have never, ever been to a hotel that does not make up a room before 3pm. We had been out all day. I do not think it is unreasonable to expect this to be done by this time. This staff member was rude and unhospitable. Someone finally came to the room around 3:30 and spent 5 minutes 'making up the room.' This did not include changing the sheets. They put in a few new towels - not enough for the family. They did not replace the depleted soap or shampoo. We asked for it and they rudely provided some, but still refused to provide soap, saying they were unauthorized to do this. Later that night, we called to ask for soap and towels, because we did not have enough to shower in the morning. We were on hold and bounced around the recorded phone message several times, and finally got a manager. She said she woulds send someone up immediately. She was extremely nice and apologetic and promised to address the situation, but 15 minutes later, nobody had come up. We called again and she said she had told housekeeping it was a priority. Someone finally came 10 minutes later.

This place uses words like 'resort' and 'villa' which are misleading. I would call it a 'unit' - not a 'villa.' Our 'unit' was extremely bare bones - drab and cheap furnishings, and very outdated. The lighting in the bathroom was so poor you could barely see, and it was connected to a vent that was extremely loud. So if you had to go to the bathroom during the night, the noise would wake up whoever else was in the room with you. The shower had the smallest, weakest fixture I can remember having. The chairs at the dining table had plastic seats which had been torn and taped over.

Overall there is zero hospitality at this place, which to me makes it unworthy of using the word 'resort.' You have to wait 10 minutes for an elevator because housekeeping seems to have carts waiting at every one of them all day long, but they can't get their act together and provide service. (I guess there is no service elevator).

Needless to say, we will not be returning nor recommending.",August 2014,Grand Pacific Palisades Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32171-d76349-Reviews-Grand_Pacific_Palisades_Resort-Carlsbad_California.html,"Carlsbad, California",hotels,1.0,4.5
Understated elegance for the perfect vacation,"We just returned from spending 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt Kauai. This resort tops any we have ever visited in terms of the overall experience. It is a beautiful and well-maintained property, with lush landscaping, incredible decor, fabulous pools and recreation facilities, and more. But above all, we have never before had such consistently amazing friendly service from every staff member we encountered. The staff just shower you with friendliness and cannot do enough to help you. Every time we interacted with someone, it was the same warm, helpful style. It contributed so much to our stay. Also, I had expected at a pricey resort like this to feel nickeled and dimed for everything, but that was not the case at all. There was plenty of free water everywhere we went, no limit on towel usage, and the food at the restaurants, by the pool, etc. was very reasonably priced with a great selection. The room was large with a terrific bathroom, and while the hotel is large, it never seemed noisy or hectic - but in fact felt tranquil everywhere. There are numerous public places to relax and enjoy beautiful views of the ocean and the grounds. I would highly recommend it.",July 2013,Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60625-d87364-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Kauai_Resort_Spa-Poipu_Kauai_Hawaii.html,"Kauai, Hawaii",hotels,5.0,4.5
