"Two activities - Via ferrata and canyoning, both fantastic!","Adam and I completed both the via ferrata and canyoning with Billy and Costino.
They are fantastic and knowledgeable guides. You will never feel unsafe but your will feel the adrenaline!
The via ferrata is extreme, a high and tough terrain but it's well worth it. You'll feel a sense of achievement.
We did the dry canyon, the rappells where high, how we like them.
I'm not gonna lie, I hurt. Two days of hard physical activity but I feel good for it.
This company does many other activities so just ask them. Great communication with Nicki.",November 2020,B.O.A - Base Outdoor Activities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d14543457-Reviews-B_O_A_Base_Outdoor_Activities-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

"Good hotel, very reasonable, average area.","I found this hotel to be clean with a good shower which is as must for me. Bedding clean and I can't fault the hotel.
Breakfast was basic but plentiful.
I didn't realise the area it is in and the comments are negative about the area.
I've travelled all over the world and I didn't find it to be particularly unsafe. I didn't go in into the main area as the hotel is near the metro. We walked everywhere (my son and I). We weren't approached or asked for money by anyone. I'm always aware of my surroundings and it felt like Le Rambla in Barcelona on a night time, a bit run.
My advice would be to keep to the main streets as we did. Be careful of the gallery side walks as you would everywhere.
I'd book here again easily.",October 2020,Ambrosia Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d8411997-Reviews-Ambrosia_Suites-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,3.5

"Disappointed, I felt we were ripped off.","It's hard to write a negative review but I was really disappointed with the service and therefore the meal we received.
I ordered chicken skewers or souvlaki but it came with 3 skewers instead of four as advertised, no salad or fries and I was still charged the same price.
My son found his meal tasty and it did come with fries.
Asked for chips and cheese and received fries and sauce. All I can say is that I felt we were treated differently and rushed.

It's either they don't know.....,".... They don't show, or they don't care about what's going on in the hood. Let me start by saying- 75 dollars each seems a bit much for a tour, but when you compare it to other excursions on offer its actually not a bad price. As a youth I'd seen the films Boyz n the hood & menace to society, and honestly never thought I'd get a chance to check out the locations or even drive through Compton. The tour operators use their knowledge of the areas they grew up in and connections to make that possible. Our guide was billy broham, and props to Billy as in my opinion he totally made the tour.
