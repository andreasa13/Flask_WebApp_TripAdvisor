Nice tour,"Guided tour with good explanations. There are some items and pieces for exhibition and the whole tour gives you a bit of the atmosphere of Berlin in the old days, including war times.

For reflection and contemplation,"cinder blocks that create a burial atmosphere . It is not an obvious attraction - one should look, sit and contemplate.

To never forget,"Something to stay in the memories of people over generations. A place that has lots of history and meaning to the humankind.

Average - needs renovation,The hotels is huge and has good breakfast (varied options and nice food). It is well located in a central area of HCMC with many shops and restaurants nearby. Rooms are a bit old and do demand renovation.

"History, culture, architecture and a stunning landscape","Cannot express how wonderful is this place. This was a real journey through the ancient history. Each piece, each structure, each stone makes you just imagine how life was in the old days and how much of legacy this old ancient people left. This is just a must-go in Athens. Make sure you take some fresh water with you and wear comfortable shoes - there is lot to walk and some climbing.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Great option in Oslo,"Awesome breakfast, nice accommodation and the perfect location - a few steps away from Central train station - makes this hotel my 1st choice every time I go to Oslo.

"Very nice hotel, staff needs training","The hotel is great, good accommodations, very nice food (varied options) and well located - walking distance from a number of shops, dining options etc. Staff in general not so kind - particularly during check-out I was assisted by a man who was extremely inpatient. I asked for a hard copy of my receipts and he was really reluctant to give it to me. He seemed no to be that happy to assist a customer and to make it more difficult he could not speak basic english (an issue for the whole staff in general). Some customer service training for staff + investment on language would help the hotel to get a 5 starts review.",November 2019,Grand Millennium Shanghai HongQiao,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g308272-d613796-Reviews-Grand_Millennium_Shanghai_HongQiao-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",hotels,4.0,4.5
Nice hotel and friendly staff,"The hotel is good for the value, excellent location, 3 minutes walking from paradise beaches and restaurants/shops. Bedrooms need some renovation but nothing that would impair our comfort. Linen and bathing clothes were good an clean. Bedroom was always clean as well. Staff is very kind and helpful except for the ladies in the breakfast (sort of waitresses that stay there around). I asked for a soft fried egg bu the lady who was cooking couldn't understand english. She asked the ""waitress""to translate it and as she couldn't do it either they called for extra help. While someone from the adm office was coming to help this""waitress""engaged to a conversation with the cooker in Thai clearly complaining about my request, grinning wryly while looking at me in clear biased way. This was an one-off bad experience I had during my stay at Sunrise Tropical; I trust management will keep training staff and would definitely consider staying there in my next trip to Thailand.",July 2018,Sunrise Tropical Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1597036-d315452-Reviews-Sunrise_Tropical_Resort-Railay_Beach_Krabi_Town_Krabi_Province.html,"Railay Beach, Thailand",hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent hotel for business trips,"Everything is good at Traders - cleanliness, friendly staff, towers view, room service and the phenomenal breakfast. Definitely my 1st option whenever I am in KL.
