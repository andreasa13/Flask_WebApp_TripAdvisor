Good value for money,"I stayed in Studio C. It was good enough to have a comfortable sleep and showers and chill/relax at times. But I did not spend much time outside of sleeping and bathing inside the hotel/room. It is not a 4 or 5 star place. But the price is good for what you get. Some noise at times from something going on behind my unit outside, and intermittent internet connectivity at times, but overall good host, felt very safe, etc. Would definitely consider staying here again in the future.
