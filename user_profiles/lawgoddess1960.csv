WORST VALENTINES DINNER EVER,"We had waited a long time to go to this restaurant since it is an hour away from our home, but having heard good things about the place we decided to try it on Valentine’s Day. I am not sure there was anything i really liked about the restaurant but i will try to explain why this place should be ashamed of themselves for charging $180 (without tip) for two people. First, we are not in New York City. There is no premium on space out in the country. That being said I am not entirely sure why there were so many tables so close to each other that we were literally having a romantic dinner with our neighbors. Since i go to New York restaurants all the time, i usually dont mind it, but since all their tables weren’t filled i wondered why they had to try to eek out the last dollar to make people uncomfortable. The server was quiet, pretty much said nothing to us and knew nothing about the menu, which i didnt realize would be streamlined from their regularly menu for a “special dinner.” There were four appetizers and four entree choices. I am usually a fish eater but the only fish item on the entree list was cod, something i solely reserve for fish and chips, certainly never a nice dinner out. Nothing on the menu looked especially appetizing, but eventually i chose the Armenian stuffed herb bread and “duck stew.” My husband chose the oyster and shrimp in cucumber broth and the lamb chops. Prior to getting the appetizer we were served a small stale roll with four olives (we each could have 2). I was starting to question this place but reserved judgement. Then the appetizers came out. A hard dough flatbread came out with a reduction of some herb in the middle, it was edible but really not enjoyable enough to eat the whole piece of bread. It seemed like a rustic peasant dish, cheap to make and easy to cook in advance. My husband’s broth and fish was just sad looking. The broth was extremely bland. It tasted like cucumber juice and there were a few oysters and undercooked shrimp with no flavor floating in it. This did not bode well for the entree but we had no idea how bad it was going to get. My husband thankfully had the lamb. There were three lamb chops. They were well cooked and although they were tender they had no taste and the sauce served with them tasted like plain yogurt. The rice on the sauce was dry, tasteless and inedible. Absolutely no vegetable was offered anywhere. As for the duck stew, for the first time in my life i actually wanted to send the food back to the kitchen. The burnt, hard, tasteless shell of rice was stuffed with “pulled duck”. I thought I might crack my teeth on the rice. And the duck? It was just mashed up duck meat. There was pomegranate juice,sauce, on the plate and that helped with the flavor but there was nothing else on the plate. Again, no vegetable anywhere. This dish was so bad I wondered why the chef would make it except that it seemed that they were serving dishes that could be cooked ahead of time in the kitchen and plated quickly. Unfortunately, this one sat for way too long waiting to be served. I am the biggest fan of duck meat, but this was not a stew and it certainly was not an elegant presentation of duck. I also cant fathom why the chef cant cook rice? My husband’s was dry and tasteless and mine was burnt and hard. Yikes! And after serving us this disgusting rice, the chef had the nerve to offer as one of his two desserts rice pudding! Between the crowded tables, the horrible food and the lifeless server, who never even noticed i took two bites of food and left the rest untouched, we skipped the dessert and went elsewhere to try to salvage our valentines dinner. Maybe it was a bad night because they strayed from their normal menu, or maybe they were trying to make as much money as they could by stuffing in as many tables as possible and serving rice, no vegetables, and precooked food, but whatever the reason i feel like i deserve an apology from this restaurant for ruining our dinner. Actually, we laughed so hard at how horrible everything was, I’m not sure it actually ruined our night out, although an apology would still be appropriate. I have no idea what others see in this restaurant, but it was seriously bad the night we went there.",February 2020,Serevan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29808-d1488555-Reviews-Serevan-Amenia_New_York.html,"Amenia, New York",restaurants,1.0,4.0
"Great breakfast, bit of a wait","Great breakfast, bit of a wait, 45 min for 1 person on a Sunday morning. Service is very pleasant and the food is excellent. I had the eggs Benedict special with pork cheeks and it was really quite nice. The portions were generous and the pork cheeks were well cooked and tasty. The hollandaise was nice and lemony and the poached egg cooked perfectly. The biscuit it was served on was was also really nice. I had the grits and i think they could definitely have cooked longer, and who doesn’t add cheese to their grits to make a decadent Sunday breakfast more decadent??? Thats my only complaint, the grits could have been better!! I would return, it was really a great place to sit and eat and enjoy!!",January 2020,Over Easy Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60742-d444122-Reviews-Over_Easy_Cafe-Asheville_North_Carolina.html,"Asheville, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Nice hotel, very minimalist","This was our first time staying at an AC by Marriott. It is antiseptically clean in a good way although the air kind of smelled like hospital clean throughout. It is immaculate and new. And has a small,but very clean gym. The service was efficient, but not overly friendly. Our room was a minimally appointed box, not too comfortable, but not uncomfortable. The couch was very hard, it being minimalist furniture. The bathroom was nice and the shower was exceptional! Really nice hair products in the room. great location and parking underneath make this ideal for a stay in Asheville especially if you want to walk around the shops and galleries downtown.
There was a lot of partying and music in the hotel. Lots of young people, dont know if that is just the location, or the bar on the 9thfloor, or if we are just getting older but we would have liked it a bit quieter especially at night. We wish they had a coffee shop downstairs in the lobby so we could have coffee in the room (the stuff in the room tasted like brown water) but there are quite a few shops just across the street and down the street so we just ran out each morning.
I would probably stay there again just for the location and cleanliness of the place.",January 2020,AC Hotel Asheville Downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60742-d10806731-Reviews-AC_Hotel_Asheville_Downtown-Asheville_North_Carolina.html,"Asheville, North Carolina",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Gorgeous, pleasant ambiance","Let me start by saying the restaurant is gorgeous, really beautiful renovated barn that has a really nice ambiance. I also like that all the food is meant to be shared so you can try a lot of different things. It ends up being quite expensive, considering the casual surroundings, but it is all very interesting. I also give the chefs credit for putting together some pretty unusual combinations of foods, ones that you wouldn’t often times find next to each other. Some of these combinations worked, others not so much, but overall a really nice meal.
We started off with the Bacalao to compare with the fish cakes from last nights Benne on Eagle, and in my opinion they just really couldn’t measure up to Benne’s. I just tasted potato and salt cod, separately. We also had the red shrimp with olives that was delicious! The roasted mushrooms were a big hit amongst all of us, and some of us really liked the squid which i thought just tasted undercooked and slimy. The pork cheek appetizer was disappointing because there was a teaspoon of pork cheek, which was very good and the rest was sort of a pork shank which was really nothing too interesting and mildly overlooked. As for the entrees we shared the steak and the whole trout. The meat eaters at the table loved the steak, although the grated potato underneath seemed like it was way undercooked and still hard. The trout was grilled and it was amazing. There is nothing better than a whole trout perfectly cooked. There were lots of shallots on the plate and it had a sort of heavy handed onion sauce with vinegar that could have been a bit lighter to enhance the mild taste of the fish. I would order it again though and ask if they had a different sauce for it. I do want to mention the charred broccoli with anchovies. The broccoli had great flavor but i wasnt quite sure how the anchovies fit in with the dish. For dessert we had the chocolate ice cream with espellete pepper which was a little too mild for the people i was sharing with, and the gateau basque was like a shortbread with very dense pastry cream baked on top. The desserts weren’t quite as outstanding as most of the dishes, but otherwise it really was a very good meal. Oddly, we ordered espresso and it was so acidic it tasted salty, so we didnt drink it, hopefully someone in the kitchen noticed it came back untouched.

I would visit this restaurant again as i think it will probably get better the longer it is open. The service was really good and as i said it really is a very nice place to gather and enjoy food.",January 2020,Forestry Camp,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60742-d19055984-Reviews-Forestry_Camp-Asheville_North_Carolina.html,"Asheville, North Carolina",restaurants,4.0,3.5
"Some things were great, others could definitely use some work","On the whole, this restaurant is very very nice. I like the variety of food choices and i like that it is a southern soul food restaurant and has so many flavors in each dish. I wish that every dish could be of similar quality, because it would be an amazing restaurant, but that just wasnt the case at our table. We started with the deviled egg spread, the fish cake, the cabbage pancake and the ribs. I’m usually a rib girl, but even though these were fall off the bone they just were kind of bland, mushy and uninteresting. The deviled egg spread however had an amazing consistency and the fish cakes were incredibly flavorful and wonderful. The cabbage pancake however took over the show, it is truly a grand example of what can be done with a seemingly bland vegetable. As for the entrees, The oxtail was outstanding, truly superb as was the scallop and shrimp purloo (which others at the table loved). The trout with spoon bread was fairly run of the mill although the sauce underneath the trout was pleasant, although extremely subtle. The pork dish was dry and far less interesting. My biggest complaint with the restaurant, aside from the few dishes that failed, was that 2 out of 4 desserts, the ones we picked, were sold out by 9 on a Friday night. We got talked into the hummingbird cake and i have to say it was one of the more disgusting creations I have ever had for dessert. It had banana pudding middle and a sicky sweet frosting. I love ending a meal with a gorgeous decadent dessert and this restaurant just fell short completely in that category. I really did like so many things, maybe if we are lucky, the chef will read this review and take care to taste some of the things Ive remarked on. It really could be a great restaurant with some extra effort.
The location is wonderful and the service and ambiance were all very nice!!! Would love to go back and see some things changed for the better.",January 2020,Benne On Eagle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60742-d15635781-Reviews-Benne_On_Eagle-Asheville_North_Carolina.html,"Asheville, North Carolina",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Fun, really fun","I wasnt sure what to expect, i thought the place might be cheesy and the desserts might be awful but actually the dessert was very good and the service was great!! We spent a bunch of time just reading through the hilarious menu and then ordered an apple dessert with vanilla ice cream. First of all, it was huge, second of all, it was beautiful and third, it actually tasted really good. No one rushed us and we had a wonderful time just eating and talking and relaxing in our “own little booth.” Go, you wont regret it until you step on the scale the next day!!!",September 2019,Better Than Sex - A Dessert Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60814-d15121258-Reviews-Better_Than_Sex_A_Dessert_Restaurant-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Nice, romantic restaurant","Nice, romantic restaurant with pleasant service and good food. We started by ordering wine and although the waitress did not know the first thing about wine the mature d’ helped us out by sending two different wines to our table to choose from. The wine list by the glass is not superb, but it is all drinkable. That being said, the dinner was excellent. The biscuits sent out from the kitchen were pleasant. We tried the meatloaf, stuffed with foie gras (or chicken liver I’m not quite sure), was interesting and quite good if you are a meat lover but the star of the evening was the shrimp and grits. I have eaten a lot of shrimp and grits in my life but i think this may have been the best one that i have ever tasted. It was definitely satisfying and creamy. I liked the restaurant but there was something missing for the high cost of the dinner, maybe it needed a little more excitement in the menu or the wine list or the service. It just seemed really pricey for what it was. It is a beautiful restaurant and i would most likely go back again.",September 2019,a.Lure,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60814-d2662397-Reviews-A_Lure-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",restaurants,4.0,4.5

The mussels here are simply irresistible. They are plump and tender and the sauce is sweet and curried. We also had the octopus which was good but wasnt our favorite. At lunch time, which is easier to get a table and less expensive, we had the salmon salad which was outrageous and the snapper risotto which i cannot recommend highly enough. If i had another day i might have gone back for more of that delicious risotto. Nice place to hang out, day or night.

Fish cheeks is awesome,Fish cheeks is awesome although impossible to get a reservation. We decided to walk in and wait and it was well worth the effort. We started with some awesome fried chicken that had an amazing sauce on it. Then we ordered some pork cheeks which were simply amazing and i would come here and wait in line just for them. We also had tiger prawn karee which were delicious. Crab fried rice which was also amazing and steamed fish. It was all delicious but i would be neglectful if i did not include a comment about the service which was excellent. This was a crowded lively restaurant but was neither too loud nor too rushed. It was absolutely perfect Thai food and we will certainly be back to try more of their food!!! I think fish cheeks far surpasses uncle boons and somtum der.

It was loud, and very popular, but i think there is a reason people want to be there. The food is really good and the service is exceptional. Our waiter Kevin C was literally there every time we even thought we needed something which was amazing since it was so crowded and he had so many other tables to attend to. All of his suggestions for dinner were spot on. We shared the lamb meatballs and the octopus and while they were good the mushroom croquettes were the star of the show. We liked them so much we ordered an extra round of them!! We also loved the stuffed churros with dulce de leche. They were really wonderful and the perfect end to a delicious meal. It is loud and crazy in the restaurant, but worth dealing with.

This will put you in a food coma and keep you dreaming of the next time you can return,"Tonight’s visit to Tuome was nothing short of exceptional. We live in the neighborhood and had often thought of visiting this restaurant but were often confused by the Michelin star which was overshadowed by the opinions of other self critics here on trip advisor which said it was way overpriced and overrated.
Tonight, despite the reviews, we decided to check it out for ourselves. I must repeat emphatically that is was nothing less than exceptional! We started the evening with a beautiful little potato and ricotta dish that was sent out as a gift from the chef. It was light and lovely but that was only the beginning. We ordered some very nice cocktails. I ordered he dragon sangria and it was a nice way to start off the evening. We ordered the octopus, the deviled eggs and the chicken liver mousse and although all of them were superb we thought the foam brown butter sauce on the octopus deserved special mention. It was so rich and had a such a great mouth feel , but it also had a wonderful taste, which is often absent in a foam sauce. As for the entrees, we shared the pig out which was a crispy pork belly with 3 different sauces on the plate, and a side portion of peanut noodles and although the pork was delicious the real standout was the garnish of arugula salad with lycees and candied walnuts. We also tried the halibut with a gorgeous light curry cream sauce that was superb as well. Everyone at the table loved the crab noodles which were very light in taste but very delicious, but the winner for me was the side dish of rice. It was sweet and pudding like and went so well with the curry and the pork! Last, but not least we had the roasted carrots with a smoky sauce and they showed just how versatile and skilled the chef was to do so much with simple ingredients like carrots. We were so stuffed we literally couldn’t eat all of our food. It was all so rich and had so many different sauces and flavors. We were completely overwhelmed by this unassuming little restaurant that leaves behind the pretentiousness but delivers on the flavor. We couldn’t leave without trying their dessert and we all shared an order of beignets with vanilla ice cream and red bean paste with a squeeze bottle of caramel sauce on the side. It was the best ice cream sandwich ever. We walked home amazed by this completely unexpected and delightful experience. The service was outstanding, the food was delicious and rich and satisfying and i wondered to myself how it could be that anyone could complain about it. My only advice is, if you are reading this review, if you really like a massive steak hanging off your plate with no sauce, you are definitely in the wrong place; however, if you enjoy watching the imagination of a perfectionist chef run wild, this might be the place for you. After dinner we debated would we go to Marea or Le CouCou or Aqyavit overTuome and we all decided we wouldn’t miss this for the world!!! Go see for yourself, its an unforgettable experience.",January 2020,Tuome,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d7247217-Reviews-Tuome-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A must see in Athens,"We didnt have much time in Athens before leaving for the islands but we made it a point to go see the Acropolis. We flew in later in the afternoon but by the time we arrived it was already closed (about 5pm). Luckily, we decided to go up first thing in the morning (8am) because it really crowded up with tour groups by the time we were leaving. We entered by walking up a very long steep climb past the amphitheater and then up to the top. It was good exercise for those who are looking for something more strenuous, but maybe a little steep if you are not prepared or able to make a long climb. There may be better ways to get to the top especially if you are going by tour bus.
The ruins were beautiful and the views from the top were spectacular. This is a place that i would go again and again, it just tells such a great story about Greek civilization.
They are doing a lot of restorative work at the top but it didnt bother our ability to see what was there and use our imagination for what wasnt.

SOMEONE FORGOT TO TELL MANAGEMENT THEY ARE A MARRIOTT,"We stayed here while visiting family and were so disappointed in the hotel it sort of wrecked our whole trip. We booked our room, king size, bay view, high floor, paying extra for all of it in advance of our arrival, but when we got there they had sold our room again to someone else. They didnt even tell us there was a problem with the room or reservation, just tried to give us a tiny little closet on the 8th floor and hope we didnt notice! Good lord this is not what I expect from a Marriott at this high of a price room!!!! The room we stayed at was so loud from the ghetto blasting bass of the street noice and the shape of the room was triangular so it made all 200 square foot of it look even smaller. Can you imagine that they had to put the TV off to the left corner of the room, impossible to see from the bed, and since there wasnt enough room for a chair, it was virtually unusable!!! They offered us $50, we were so mad and got no sleep!!!! Seriously, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!!

Very nice theatre district restuarant,"We had tickets to the Harry Potter broadway show and took the break between the afternoon and evening show to meet at kellari tavern to have a relatively quick dinner. The service was exceptional, and the ambiance was very nice too. These are two things which are most noticeably lacking when eating dinner In the theater district.
We ordered a couple of dishes on the menu to share including the grilled octopus, which was excellent; the Faroe island salmon tartare which was good, but probably my least favorite dish; a mussel dish and a seafood stew, both of which were excellent. Our only regrets as we sat there was that we did not order the whole fish which we noticed many people had ordered and looked amazing! We will definitely order the fish the next time we go back.we shared two desserts, the baklava and the egg custard in phyllo and they were fabulous.
The dinner was quite pricey, but the food really was delicious and the place was really perfect for us. It was quiet enough so there was no hustle and bustle and the waitstaff was attentive enough to warrant us making a return trip.

Great little neighborhood place,"This restaurant is tucked away amidst a ton of other restaurants. It is a small place, and it is very quiet and calm inside. I didnt know what to expect since the reviews seem to be all over the map on this one.
We only tried a few dishes but liked all of them. We started with the Jonah crab and smoked salmon rice and it was very smoky tasting and it was really good. We also had the homemade dumplings and they were truly delicious. Finally we shared the poke bowl and that was excellent as well. The dishes were all small portions and in the end we had room to share a chocolate sundae with coconut ice cream which was very good.
We did not have any alcohol, and only ordered a few dishes but the bill came to $100 for the two of us.

Excelllent historical tour of the area and new york,"I happened upon this church as i was walking through Nolita and thought it might be fun to check out the candlelight tour of the catacombs. The tour is scheduled to leave at 11, 1 and 3 and it was easy enough to secure a ticket for the next tour right at the entrance to the sign.
Brittany was our tour guide and she was cheerful, energetic and informative. She provided us with a ton of information about the role that the church played in early New York history and it was fun to hear about all of the famous people that frequented this church. She was extremely knowledge and friendly and i dont think i could have asked for a better introduction to the subject. I especially liked the tour of the 2500 pipe organ from behind the scenes as well as the stories about the people who were interred in the catacombs. If you happen to be passing and are interested in the history of New York this is a really nice way to pass an hour and a half.

"Expensive, better than average Chinese food, but maybe not worth the high price","The Infatuation website came out with its list of best restaurants in Chinatown today and after reading through all of the potential choices, i decided to go for “the absolute best.” The absolute best comes with a high price tag (for Chinese food) and i will admit that my expectations were instantly raised. I decided to have it delivered from postmates since it was raining and i was being enormously lazy. There is something about Chinese food being delivered on a rainy day in New York that makes me love living in this city, but this time the price i paid for that laziness left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and no matter how much i tried to like the food i just couldn’t muster up much enthusiasm. I ordered food at 5:15 and was promised delivery by 7:00. By 7:35, i felt like a rabid dog and called the restaurant asking where my food was. The woman on the phone was outraged that i was mad even after I explained that I had just paid about $40 in fees and taxes and had ordered almost 3 hours ago. Ultimately, she disclaimed any knowledge of these fees and told me it simply wasnt her problem. She repeatedly stated that the food would be there soon. We definitely were not off to a good start with this dinner.
The food finally arrived at about 7:50 and between the food and the tip for the delivery person we had reached a whopping bill of $130.00. Here’s what we ordered: Cold Sesame Noodles, Fried Dumplings, Half order of Peking Duck, Dry Crispy Beef and Fried Rice. I have paid a lot for meals in New York, and granted the food only totaled $88.00, which is probably too much for Chinese food, but at $130.00 this one just seemed insulting.
As for the review of the food, the Peking duck was admittedly delicious, it truly was, although I’m not sure that I haven’t had that same delicious duck in many other places in Chinatown. It was old school and a taste that was familiar to me, and i will eat it again and again in a ton of places, but probably never again here. The dry beef was interesting, very crispy, more like a sweet coated beef jerky, but nonetheless it was tasty. As for the cold sesame noodles, I don’t know who at the infatuation website wrote that article, but i have to disagree, there is a world of sesame noodle out there that is much, much better. I can say the same for the fried dumpling as well, which was simply nothing special. The fried rice wasnt fried, which was good since this place doesnt give you white rice with your $130 order, the only thing remarkable about it was that it had a few quality shrimp in it otherwise it tasted like plain white rice with egg.
For a restaurant that is trying to reinvent its image i was shocked that they couldn’t care less if they had delivery problems or how much you pay to get their food. I think for the level they are at they should at least look into who they are partnering with. Ultimately i will never know who charged all of the fees associated with this meal, but i am done with postmates and Hwa Yuan.
Had this delivery issue not occurred with this restaurant would i have thought more kindly about the food? Probably not, Chinese food from New York’s Chinatown is so good in so many venues and i can pay half the price for it anywhere else.
While i admit it may have been a better idea to go enjoy the service in the restaurant and maybe that would have made the high prices more palatable, but ultimately the meal just wasnt that good. Save your money, go find Peking duck at some of the great, no-frills restaurants in Chinatown and enjoy that old time taste that made New York’s Chinatown so famous. For me, i will leave this place to the rich people who don’t care if the value of a meal is commensurate with what they pay.",June 2019,Hwa Yuan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d13082326-Reviews-Hwa_Yuan-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Really good pizza slice,"I’m not a huge fan of pizza, in fact, i usually eat one slice and I’ve had enough, but i will make an exception for a slice of artichoke pizza. This is really creamy almost like they covered the crust with a can of cream of artichoke soup and baked it with cheese on top. Comfort food at its best and really delicious.
We also tried the crab pizza which was interesting, but a bit overwhelming for me as I’m not a huge fan of surimi, as opposed to real crab,which they don’t use. The meatball and the pepperoni pizza were very good too but similar to so many other pizzerias in New York.
The slices are expensive, i think the artichoke slice was $6, but they are huge and it’s nice to be able to buy just one slice instead of a whole pie. There is no place to eat but that’s fine if you just want a quick meal to take away.",May 2019,Artichoke Basille's Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d15162035-Reviews-Artichoke_Basille_s_Pizza-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Theater district sure bet,"I am always hard pressed to find someplace nice to have dinner before a show in the theater district, and reluctantly went to Becco even though i had heard it recommended many times. It was a bit daunting when we arrived, as the place was completely packed. I mean wall to wall people kind of packed, and it seemed like chaos, and the hostess was less than warm and she was a bit late on our seating. As i was standing with the massive crowd, I was actually tempted to leave thinking this wasn’t my type of scene at all, But once we were settled in, upstairs, it was much quieter, and we had a wonderful waiter who was both efficient and professional. While the place itself may have lacked warmth and charm, the food more than made up for anything that was lacking. The family style salad was large and delicious. We then ordered the fried calamari which were very good. It was not the best I’ve ever had, but then again the place was packed and there was an enormous portion that the three of us were unable to finish so I couldn’t be too critical. I then ordered the short ribs which was absolutely delicious and my friend ordered the halibut which melted in our mouths. My husband had the swordfish which was interesting as it was served in 3 thin portions. It was probably our least favorite of the dishes but quite honestly they were all delicious and more than filling! We were out in time to see our show and were fully satisfied with out dinners. It wasnt cheap, but the quality of the food was excellent. I would love to go back and try it again sometime when the pre dinner theater crowd has already left.",May 2019,Becco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d424429-Reviews-Becco-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good Chinese food,"I tried this Chinese restaurant after reading the reviews which were a mixed bag of complaints and raves. I decided to do takeout since i am not a fan of crowded loud restaurants and i think that was a wise choice. When i called in the order it was crazy busy but there was no problem ordering except that i had to leave my full credit info with the harried woman which was slightly unnerving.
I’m not a huge fan of spicy food, but I’m willing to give it a try sometimes. So i ordered the chili oil wontons which were exceptional, the lamb with cumin which was also very good, the wonton soup was so bland it was almost tasteless and the dandan noodles were interesting but tasted a lot like spaghetti with minced pork and a mild hint of peanut.
I can see why it is popular with the younger and more spice driven crowd. I have had much worse Chinese food in my life and definitely would rate it above your average take out joint. Whether ill go back, that remains to be seen.",April 2019,Han Dynasty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d5031531-Reviews-Han_Dynasty-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Old World Italian,"I was in the theater district and we stopped in for a quick dinner. The waitstaff rushed us through our meal, which really wasnt that much fun since we met up early so we could enjoy a leisurely dinner before we went to a show. That aside, the food was old school Italian, nothing too special, but not too bad either. I ordered the lasagna and it was extremely cheesy and gooey, so if you like that sort of food, this is the place for you. It’s extremely cozy and if they just let us relax we would have had a nice dinner. There are much better places in the area however so based on the lack of friendliness of the waitress, the rushing us out the door and the lackluster food, I don’t think i will be going back too soon.",April 2019,Mercato,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1898220-Reviews-Mercato-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Great BBQ,"I am nor a lover of BBQ and definitely not Kansas City BBQ after spending quite a few years in the South. However, I will say that this BBQ was excellent. The smell of the wood smoked meat alone was worth the trip! We ordered quite a few things so we could try everything, and really everything was quite delicious. We ordered the chicken wings which were sticky and crispy! The Pork Belly appetizer and a side of Mac and cheese were just as good. We ordered the judges plate and the burnt ends brisket and were not disappointed! The pork ribs were definitely the highlight of the meal. This is a no pretense joint and the service is friendly and welcoming. We had a reservation so there was no wait.

Another Fantastic food tour,"This is my third tour with Foods of New York Tours. I have loved each one, and amazingly they have each been very different. The food is always fantastic and the history and stories that go along with it are both interesting and entertaining. Most recently, i went on the Old Greenwich Village tour with Burt. Two of the tours I have taken have been led by Burt, and from the very first time i met him, i became acutely aware that he was a very special person. He is completely well versed in all things New York and yet his Southern charm is what shines through most of all. He has an easy laugh and his brilliant conversation will make you wish you were spending your entire vacation with him. Burt is a bright star shining in the universe and i feel grateful to have come into his orbit, if only for 3 short hours. This food tour is fantastic and it is without reservation that i highly recommend it to anyone who loves food!",April 2019,Foods of New York Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d1135188-Reviews-Foods_of_New_York_Tours-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,5.0
Better than the hype!!!,"Have always wanted to try this restaurant, but never found a time that was right. I mean a lobster roll is a lobster roll, right? Wrong!!! This lobster roll is so creamy and sweet and delicious it blew me away! The bread is buttery and soft and the lobster is ample and perfectly tender. Not overly mayo-ed, not over cooked.Omg! I really can’t recommend this highly enough.
We went during lunch so we could avoid the lines, but I would wait for hours to eat this delicious food. The clam
Chowder was good, but no where near as good as the lobster roll. I have read that the fried oyster sandwich is the star of the show and I will be sure to try it next time!!! Clam chowder, lobster roll and 2 glasses of wine, more than enough food for 2, and only $70.00!!! What a luxurious, indulgent lunch, treat yourself, you will not regret it!!!",January 2019,Pearl Oyster Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d457767-Reviews-Pearl_Oyster_Bar-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great little vacation spot,"Martinique is a beautiful island. It has green mountains and blue waters. The people are French and therefore you feel like you are traveling much further than the Caribbean. The transfer from the airport was long but on time and very pleasant.The Club itself is quite small compared to the Mexican Riviera club. It has very few kids and 90% of the staff and guests speak French. If you are going to meet people, you better speak French because there is literally no one there that speaks English very well. We had a big group so we felt well occupied. There are limited choices for activities since the club is so small but we felt content to sit on the beach and kayak and paddle board. There is no snorkeling around the hotel so you have to take a boat to see any fish. The rooms were very nice, depending on which room you get. At first we had a dark, small dinghy room, but after two nights we complained and they moved us to a better room with a better view. Aside from the first room being depressing, the food was probably the worst part of the vacation. The a la carte restaurant was no better, maybe worse than the buffet. The buffet had nice things like lobster, lamb chops and fresh fish, the problem was everything was over cooked! We understood recycling the leftovers for cold lunch but overcooking French food is just inexcusable. The cheeses and breads were nice at dinner and the salads were nice for lunch, but they need a total makeover on their dining choices!!!! I was actually excited to taste their food, but it was mediocre at best.
That being said, it is beautiful and quiet and a nice place to relax and the food gives you good incentive to skip some meals and lose a few pounds. Even though i consider myself a foodie i would actually go back to this resort again provided i checked which room i was in first!!!!",January 2019,Club Med Les Boucaniers - Martinique,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147331-d151605-Reviews-Club_Med_Les_Boucaniers_Martinique-Sainte_Anne_Arrondissement_of_Le_Marin_Martinique.html,Martinique,hotels,4.0,4.5
Wow what a wonderful little French restaurant,"We were going to the cherry lane theater to see a show and decided to stop in to have a quiet dinner. The waitstaff was amazing, very friendly and extremely professional. We ordered the oysters on the half shell and were blown away by them. The mignonette sauce was excellent, but the oysters themselves were some of the best we have ever had. They were brought in from the Boston area and truly were firm and fresh and not at all briny. What a treat!! So much so, that we ordered a second round. I ordered the mussels and fries and they were superb as well. The sauce was so good, i wanted to drink it and the fries were crispy and salty and amazing! My husband ordered the lamb fete and it was a party on his plate! The lamb rib let was my favorite but he liked the lamb chop and leg just as well! We ordered a creme brûlée for dessert and it was the perfect finish to an amazing meal. This may become my go to restaurant in New York when i just want a fantastic meal in a quiet little restaurant.
Thank you to all at the restaurant, you really do a superb job!!! This may be the best kept secret in New York until now!!",December 2018,Le Gigot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d423252-Reviews-Le_Gigot-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Very nice casual Greek restaurant,"We arrived at Eros with no reservation and the host was happy to seat us right away. We were told that there was no alcohol being served that evening, but we decided to stay anyway. We were glad we did.
We ordered two appetizers and one entree, all of them were very simple and tasty. We started with the grilled octopus which was a very large portion and nicely cooked and flavored. We also had the Scottish salmon tartare with avocado which was also excellent. We shared a whole bronzino and watched the waiter expertly fillet it in front of us. The fish was perfectly cooked and there was so much food we couldn’t even eat it all.
Somehow, we managed to eat the phyllo dough with custard which they brought to our table free of charge!!
It really was a delightful weekday dinner spot and we will stop in again.
I read some of the other reviews and while they said it was a little disco like inside, even that didnt really bother me.

Awesome hidden old fashioned speakeasy type bar,"What a treat to go to an old timey bar that is beautiful and historic and have wonderful drinks.

"Not you’re basic Mexican fare, oh no, not at all","Down an uncrowded street, in an unassuming building we found Limones. It was festive, classy and warm and had wonderful food and drinks. We started with cocktails including a cucumber margarita, a blood orange margarita and a habanero and carrot margarita—all were fresh and delicious! We shared a wonderful sampler of ceviche from the classic red snapper, to the ahi to the squid they were all amazing. Along with the thick freshly cut chips it was amazing. Lest you think this is your everyday average American restaurant, think again!! We ordered lamb chops which were every bit as tender and tasty as a French restaurant. We also ordered the seafood stew which had a whole bunch of sea scallops, mussels and chorizo. Sound like a weird combination? It was truly to die for we couldn’t lap up enough of the sauce it was so good. And the mussels were like tender little velvet morsels. We also had the eggplant chilaquilles which was interesting but wasn’t as dramatically wonderful and was a more traditional Mexican dish. They forgot to start our lamb chops so the server, who was exceptionally sweet, came over and apologized, as did the manager. We didn’t complain or say a word, then they graciously offered to buy our desserts. Full as we were, we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to taste dessert and we ordered 2 to share. The first was a bread pudding with a burnt caramelly type sauce and that was nothing really too special, very dense but still tasty, but the other dessert we shared was the churros and they were masterfully fried to a crisp crunch and had a nice coating of large grain sugar, it was also served with a wonderful sauce that tasted like the top of a creme brûlée, burnt sugar caramel-delicious!!! We were well fed and well taken are of, this restaurant is awesome for those people who would like a special evening out, I’m not sure the typical taco crowd would necessarily enjoy but we sure did!",November 2018,Limones,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60742-d653597-Reviews-Limones-Asheville_North_Carolina.html,"Asheville, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Amazing, just amazing","There isn’t much that i can say that hasn’t been written, but good lord this was an amazing restaurant. This is one of Katie Buttons restaurants and i fussed because on our recent trip to Asheville NC i was unable to snag a dinner reservation even though i had tried months in advance. I was able to get a reservation for Sunday brunch and thought we would have to settle for the brunch menu which only has about 4 items, but when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised with not only the brunch menu and the bar menu but also the full tapas menu!!! We made the most of our experience and ordered way too many dishes but it was so worth it! The papas brava and octopus tapas were standard but cooked really well. The garlic shrimp too, cooked well but kind of standard. Then we went on to the more dramatic dishes. We had the liver cannelloni with Bechamel and manchego cheese, yes it was fantastic! Very heavy, but great for sharing. We also had the broccoli, cauliflower and raisins with celeriac purée which was pure heaven, i mean it. I know it was all vegetables but it probably wasn’t healthy and tasted like dessert. Our waitress, Miller, who was excellent, suggested we eat this with our grilled sliced Iberico pork tenderloin and she was not wrong. Wow! We all remarked that this was more like a great steak than pork. This led us to discuss why no other pork tenderloin tastes like this!! We were truly full but decided to push forward with desserts because we fell we were winning at the roulette table so why stop now. We narrowed it down to three dessert and felt like we had won the jackpot! Each one was better than the next. The basque cheesecake was beautiful and served with a cherry compote and sheeps milk whipped cream. The Marconi almond tart with the creamy center and drunken cherries were absolutely remarkable, but the real shining star of the dessert choices was the browned chocolate ganache tart with the olive oil ice cream and olive oil crotons. I’m not sure who thought that combination would be a good combination, but it seriously was a dessert i wont forget too quickly, in fact, i think i need to get the cookbook so i can make it at home. The service, the atmosphere and the food were all fantastic and the minute i make flight reservations for my next trip to Asheville i will be sure to follow up with reservations for Cúrate again.
My advice, don’t save room for dessert, eat everything and then make more room for dessert, its all awesome.",November 2018,Cúrate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60742-d2032063-Reviews-Curate-Asheville_North_Carolina.html,"Asheville, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Southern biscuits elevated to a new level,"Oh joy, of joys, when can i go again!!!!!We got a tip from a guy who went to a farming college out here that this was the place for breakfast. It was!! This was about a 20 min drive from west Asheville towards black mountain and it was well worth it because the food was wonderful and the foliage was spectacular. We were on our way to the Biltmore estate, more about that in another review and thought this would be the perfect brunch to help us through an entire day of sightseeing. We had a bit of a wait to order but that gave us plenty of time to decipher the menu and determine which covered biscuit to tackle. We opted for the biscuit Benedict, basically an eggs Benedict on a biscuit, and the seven sisters grit cakes with fried chicken, fried green tomato and country ham. While waiting we took a blueberry scone to hold us over and 5 of us were satisfied with one really well made scone. We also helped ourselves to the jam bar where we sampled the peach, blueberry, strawberry, raspberry and honey. The peach and the honey were clear winners in the best tasting jam contest. When our entrees arrived they were perfectly cooked and everything was delicious. Home-made, only better. The biscuits were huge and fluffy and the fried chicken was moist and crisp. The fried green tomato was very nice and the ham was good and salty. One outstanding taste was the nutmeg flavored fried grit cake with the fried chicken, add honey and it was al one ever needed to tackle the Vanderbilt’s estate. I would go there again, i would order more, i would enjoy it again and again.",November 2018,Blue Ridge Biscuit Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48962-d4795208-Reviews-Blue_Ridge_Biscuit_Company-Black_Mountain_North_Carolina.html,"Black Mountain, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Romantic, greater food, great service","I was so pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. It is a little tiny restaurant, hidden away on a tiny little street in Greenwich Village. It was truly exceptional. We were seated in the garden with the open air roof above us and it was really beautiful and romantic. The waiters were attentive and the service was unrushed. The food was awesome. I ordered the Zupa d Pesce and it was a glorious bowl of shellfish swimming is a tomato garlic broth all covered with a thin layer of flatbread. There was a shameful amount of lobster, mussels, clams, scallops, calamari, and fish but i loved every bite. I used the thin bread to dip into the bowl of broth and it was heavenly!! My husband had the veal chop and it was huge and very nicely prepared. The cavolfiore Palma was excellent as well, i cant ever remember eating a creamier whip of cauliflower!!!
I cant wait to go back, what a great restaurant!!! Absolutely beautiful, what NYC is all about.",October 2018,Palma,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d423264-Reviews-Palma-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Ramen, just plain old ramen","I love ramen. I’m not a connoisseur of ramen, i just really like to eat it when i feel like having comfort food. I was looking forward to trying Ippudo since i had heard so much about it and there is usually such a long wait. I decided to go early in the day when there wouldnt be too many people waiting. I was quickly seated at the bar after having a greeting by the entire restaurant staff. This greeting continued for each subsequent customer and while it might have been charming after the first couple of people arrived, i found it loud and disruptive after a while. I ordered the classic ramen with a soft boiled egg. It didn’t take long for my bowl to arrive. It came with thin noodles and some kind of bamboo shoot that was too hard to eat. The 2 small slices of pork had a ton of fat on them and the meat portion was still tough so i decided not to eat that part of the soup. The broth was pretty good but definitely could have been served hotter. By ramen standards it was a fairly small portion, but since i am not a huge eater I didn’t eat the whole bowl. I wanted to bring some home for my husband to try since i thought i probably wouldn’t ever want to go back but it was forbidden as i was told by the waiter. This ramen was really just average. There are so many better places, i just cant see why anyone would make an effort to go to this place. With tip, i paid $25.00 and didn’t even get to take the rest of the meal with me.Quite frankly there are much better, much cheaper places to go to, count me out on this one, I don’t think I’ll be going back.
If you really want interesting ramen head over to Tsuoro Ton Tan off Union Square, nicer atmosphere and fantastic ramen choices!!",October 2018,Hakata Ippudo NY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1026774-Reviews-Hakata_Ippudo_NY-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Interesting Mexican menu,"I enjoyed having drinks at the black ant although it was definitely bar volume music not restaurant volume so we had to eat outside in front, which was nice, but 2nd ave is kind of loud too.
I had a watermelon margarita and my husband had a cucumber margarita. They were nice and light in flavor and since we got there just before happy hour ended we were happy to have a cheap margarita (ends at 7pm, $8). We also had a very nice duck taco which was on the happy hour menu and it was terrific. We ordered duck dumplings with mole and there was too much fry for me on the dumplings, not enough filling, so I didn’t eat this, but i did enjoy the swordfish taco, which wasn’t quite as good as the duck taco but it was pretty good.
The waitress was super sweet and i think I would go back to at least try some of the other offerings on the menu which were pretty unusual for a Mexican style restaurant. If you can go before happy hour ends, the food was just as good on the bar menu.",September 2018,The Black Ant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d6786935-Reviews-The_Black_Ant-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.5
"Really good mussels, very loud","The appetizers we started with were not a great example of how good the mussels would be. We started off with some east coast oysters which were not very exciting (nothing fancy like row 34 and there were no west coast oysters). We then had some fried calamari which was really very ordinary. The best part of the meal, of course, were the mussels. There were so many choices for mussel sauces we literally could not choose one. We loved the Thai mussels and the curried mussels but we finally decided to have the Maine lobster mussels and they were great!! The bowl had small bits of lobster and the sauce tasted like a really good clam chowder. The bread that we used to dip into the sauce was very nice and we were lucky to have a very sweet waitress helping us. It was so loud in the restaurant we felt lucky to have found a table outside in the front. I really liked flex, but as loud as the dining room is i think i can only go on beautiful days when i can sit outside. This was a fun place and at approx $20 for a huge bowl of mussels, it was a pretty good deal. The fries that came with the mussels were great too!!! If you love mussels with very unique sauces this is definitely the place to go!!",September 2018,Flex Mussels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1984030-Reviews-Flex_Mussels-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Very romantic and beautiful,"From the moment we entered the Addison we knew that we were in for a special evening. The bar area was beautiful and overlooked a waterfall with gardens. It was right on the golf course and the outdoor seating was so comfortable and elegant. We ordered lemon drop martinis and sat outside enjoying the cool breeze on the deck. The lovely maitre’ d told us that we could enjoy our drinks as long as we liked as our table was ready whenever we were. When we finished our drinks we were shown to our table in a spectacular dining room with perfectly spaced tables. The chairs were instantly pulled our for us by three attentive waitstaff. We opted not to order the chefs tasting menu ($250.00) not necessarily because of the price, although it is hefty, but because we have been let down by other restaurants where the chefs have been left to make the choices for the evening. We all had the foie gras topped with passion fruit and served with chocolate brioche. It was truly unbelievable. The foie gras was creamy like a mousse and the passion fruit was tart and served with the chocolate bread. It will go down in my book as one of the most memorable appetizers ever created. We moved on to the next course which wasn’t quite as good, but was beautifully presented. I had the green curry mussels and while the mussels were tender and tasty it tasted more like a broccoli/cauliflower purée than a green curry purée. The coconut foam that was supposed to be over the dish was so mild it didn’t add much flavor. My daughter had the chicken en brioche and it seemed like an old school chicken pate en brioche rather than a modern deconstructed dish. No one at the table loved this dish but two things made up for the lack of flavor in the chicken. One was the bowl of creamy corn served with it and the other was a small piece of pork belly and these made the plate worth ordering! For entrees, I had the veal which was creative and tasted like no other veal dish i have ever had. It was presented like two crab cakes and the veal was encrusted and so tender you didn’t even need a knife to cut it. My daughter had the roasted duck and it was served again with foie gras and a tangy marmalade that was excellent. It came with some kind of an endive vegetable in a bowl (we think) but we didn’t really care for that. My husband had a miso style carmelized sablefish and it was wonderfully cooked and was definitely a healthier choice than the rest of our dishes. For dessert, we ordered a Mille Fuille which we all thought was the weakest part of the meal. In fact, we all remarked that all of the baked items/dessert items were no where near up to par with the chef’s creations. All in all, it was about $110 a person without wine, cocktails and service and coming from New York I thought it was expensive but not completely outrageous. The service was outstanding (almost over the top) but really unbelievable!!! And the food in general was creative and perfectly prepared. There were some dishes that we didn’t like as much as other dishes but really the only thing we found wrong with the place was the breads and desserts (just a note, in case the chef has the opportunity to read this, the chocolate brioche was amazing but the rest of the baked breads/dessert/cookies were completely dry and over cooked).
I would go again, but only for a truly special occasion. This is a place you go to celebrate a great event and hopefully by then they will have perfected it!!! In reading my own review, it sounds like I was a bit negative in my review but i really did enjoy it very much i just think my expectation gets raised when i pay so much for a dinner.

Awesome location and food,"We had the opportunity to go here on the evening of July 4th just as the fireworks were going off over the wharf. We sat half outdoors/half indoors and enjoyed every minute of our dinner. Our centerpiece on the table was a small table side fireplace in the middle of the table and it made everything even more beautiful. The decor is charming with its stuffed wild animals and lots of books on the walls. We started our meal with two appetizers, first we had the Brussels sprouts which were grilled and wonderful even for those people who aren’t too crazy about Brussels sprouts. Then we had the roasted eggplant dip which was also full of flavor and superb. We shared the hangar steak, the deep fried hen, and pillowy gnocchi with wild boar sausage. It was all excellent. The gnocchi was amazing and the deep fried hen tasted like a really awesome fried chicken. The service was friendly and fun and the prices were really fair, not too expensive. The cocktails were nice as well and so this is a place that i will go back to again and again. You definitely need a reservation if you are going later in the evening.",July 2018,Craft and Commerce,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d2076240-Reviews-Craft_and_Commerce-San_Diego_California.html,"San Diego, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Attentive and Knowledgeable bartenders,"When we went to San Diego we read some reviews and we decided not to go here for dinner because it seemed like a “place to see and be seen dropping your cash” kind of a place. We did decide to drop in for a drink anyway and we were pleasantly surprised by how professional our bar tender was and how seriously they take their cocktails. I ordered my usual, a lemon drop martini and it was seriously delicious. We sat at the bar upstairs, which was beautiful and the bartender was friendly and the drinks were superb. What’s not to like?

Awesome oysters and bar,"We dropped in here for a quick round of oysters and drinks before dinner at another restaurant. We love oysters and consider ourselves connoisseurs —. always looking to find oysters that beat our favorite Row 34s. We started with 6 ironside select oysters which were a combination of briny and sweet and then decided to get 6 more this time getting 3 of the ironside and 3 of the totten islands (?). We were blown away by the tottens. We ordered 6 more just to be sure they really as creamy as the first. They are creamy and huge and sweet with a slight briny finish. Absolutely love them!!! They are from Washington State and we really didn’t want to leave but had to rush off to a reservation. BTW, the drinks were nice and the bartender was excellent!

Interesting dining room and menu,"This restaurant was very interesting. The decor was beautiful and the waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable. It was a little further off little Italy and this made it a little less crowded and crazy!! We ordered some lovely cocktails but the pomplemousse popsicle with white rum, st Germaine and grapefruit juice was divine. We ordered a bunch of small plates to share. Since we had already had a bunch of oysters at another restaurant we decided to only get 4 small plates. They were all very nice. My favorite was the duck meatball with grits. It was perfect! We also had the Szechuan lamb noodles which were very tasty but not spicy at all. The pork belly dumplings had amazing flavor and the soft shell crab with avocado and rice was very nice as well. My absolute favorite thing we had was the bodin for dessert which was a cup of real butterscotch pudding, caramel and sea salt. Holy moley, it was great!!! The plates were relatively inexpensive (about $14) and they were shareable and wonderful. We loved this place and i will look forward to going back to it.",July 2018,Kettner Exchange,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d7285843-Reviews-Kettner_Exchange-San_Diego_California.html,"San Diego, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Uninteresting,"It was a hot day in La Jolla and we were just walking around. Just wanted a small bite to eat like a taco. You had to buy 3 tacos which wasn’t so bad but they really were nothing special. My husband had the lobster taco which just tasted like fry to me and i had some kind of pork taco but it was really nothing special either. He also had the special taco which was just some kind of brisket, but again nothing special. Either was the salsa which tasted like the juice from a roasted bell pepper. The drinks were fine but the bartender was unfriendly and the place was busy and kind of crazy. I can skip this place next time.",July 2018,Puesto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32578-d2570045-Reviews-Puesto-La_Jolla_San_Diego_California.html,"La Jolla, California",restaurants,2.0,4.5
OMG best gelato anywhere,"This place is a gem! The gelato is fantastic and just sitting outside enjoying it is a treat as well.

Elegant and perfect,"The first time I was here I just ordered the crudo and was pleasantly delighted. On this trip back, i ordered a lot more than crudo!!! In fact, we had a hard time deciding on what to get since it all looked so good. We did order some crudo and each one was more wonderful than the next. Then we moved on to stroprezetti, which was the pasta with crab and it was great. We also had the Adriatic Sea soup and it was wonderful as well.. all of the fish was so fresh and tasty. Large portions made it so we couldn’t eat it all! We had asked our server about nettle pesto pasta, and even though we hadn’t ordered it she brought us a plate of it to try. The pesto was fantastic!!!The service is very professional and the food is amazing. This restaurant is truly a treat and one of the best fish restaurants in the city. What a treat to eat at a restaurant that is so great!",July 2018,Marea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1444705-Reviews-Marea-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Bad night or just really tired restaurant?,"After reading the reviews i was quite excited to go to Pylos but now really regret wasting my time and money. The restaurant is really cute and has a nice ambience. It is located in a lively location and i had very high hopes for the evening. It definitely did not live up to its reputation!! First, it only serves Greek wine and beer which isn’t necessarily bad, but I asked my server for a suggestion and the wine she bought was almost undrinkable. That aside, we decided to start with mezze but were told we weren’t allowed to order appetizers first, we had to order the entire meal all at one time. So, we did, which after tasting the appetizers we never would have ordered anything further, so I guess that’s why they make you order everything all at once. We ordered the light as air meatballs, which were actually quite good except they were just meatballs, no sauce, no nothing. It might have been a little better served with tsasiki or something, but it wasn’t. It was just a tasty meatball. The biggest problem was the octopus which literally couldn’t even be cut with a knife. I’m a big fan of octopus and this was just pitiful. In fact, we left ours on the plate, but the waiter was too busy grabbing the plates to notice that we hadn’t even eaten it. Next we had out main courses which were the dorado whole bronzino and moussaka. The moussaka was very good. Not very heavy, but the best part, the topping, was pretty stingy while the majority of the dish was vegetables and very little meat. It really was quite good as moussaka goes, but also needed some improvement . As for the fish, yikes, it was so over cooked we didn’t even want to eat it. Accompanying the fish was a bowl of melted butter and some capers carelessly thrown on the fish as if that would somehow make the dry mess any more edible! I imagine at some point this was a good restaurant but I’m not sure if the chef cared that 2 out of 4 of his dishes were served inedible. The bill for 2 was about 150.00 but the only redeeming part to the place was My Big Gay Ice Cream parlor across the street which had the most amazing salted caramel cones. So, save your money and your calories and head to the ice cream parlor and skip the restaurant entirely.",June 2018,Pylos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d425831-Reviews-Pylos-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,2.0,4.5
"Some things good, some things not so good","The restaurant is very pretty and we stopped in for dinner prior to seeing a show. The location was great and the menu was very interesting. I’m not that huge of an eater, but it would be generous to say that their portions were even adequate. The best thing we ordered was the soft shell crab and it was truly wonderful. The batter was light and it was meaty and crabby! Of course there was only one pre serving, but it was so good maybe we should have ordered more. We also had a fried artichoke salad which was nothing special as was the really expensive paella which was just that, expensive and pretty tasteless. There were a couple of little cockles and a few shrimp that tasted like they were cooked separately and added afterwards. There were a few mussels, but I’m not sure if there was much else. Surprisingly there was very little rice which is so cheap, and so are cockles and mussels, so instead of trying to be chic the chef could have served us a whole meal for basically the same price. We had just been to Soccarat that week and had a huge lobster paella with friends and it was so enjoyable and wonderful and there was more than enough to eat with friends. Unfortunately, this serving at Ortiz, which was about 60 for two was just embarrassing and left us hungry. As for the taste, the chef should probably go to Soccarat to learn how to serve tasty paella that is meant to be shared. Dessert, on the other hand, was surprisingly the best part of the meal. We had the goat cheese cream and cherries and the custard tart and both were served with generous portions and excellent. I imagine the pastry chef and the main chef went to different schools!
I’m not sure i need to go back here, it wasn’t bad, it just wasn’t good enough for the price. And, i was hungry afterwards. . .",June 2018,Ortzi NYC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d12385942-Reviews-Ortzi_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Very loud but food was worth it,"I usually shy away from really loud restaurants, but the food was so good here i think i would go back anyway. It was very loud and very lively but there was also something really cool about the place. The food was very good and the service was efficient although not exactly friendly. We ordered the grasshopper tacos which were excellent and the fish tacos. The avocado fries were decadent and wonderful. The portions were huge and the food was excellent. I’m not usually a Mexican food fan, but this was the real thing, no canned food here. Definitely go, just be prepared for the noise. The margaritas help with relaxing, although avoid the smoky margarita, it was really unpleasant tasting.",June 2018,Tacuba Hell's Kitchen Cantina Mexicana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d10728674-Reviews-Tacuba_Hell_s_Kitchen_Cantina_Mexicana-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Unexpected surprises,"With all the hype about David Cheng restaurants, and after watching him on various interviews, I’m not certain i had any burning desire to visit one of his restaurants. I figured they would be expensive and crowded and not nearly as good as promoted. I was wrong. This was incredibly wonderful and I would surely go back again. We ate at the bar and the waitstaff could not have been more attentive. We started with cocktails, which were really good. I had a lemon drop martini which was excellent and my husband had the fresh lime and basil cocktail which was also good. We then ordered some pink moon oysters from canada and they w ere clean and cold and served just right. Then we had the burrata with curry and potatoes which was very interesting and strangely wonderful. We then ate the ribs which were the only part of the meal that was uninspired. Luckily, we ordered the pork buns which were off the menu and they were really good. The pork belly was tender and tasted great with the homemade pillowy pocket of dough. Later on, we learned there were other dishes we could order that weren’t on the menu, like a sausage and noodle dish, served like a gnocchi, which we plan to try on our next visit. We also ordered a ham appetizer that was absolutely delicious and served with a coffee mayonnaise that was spectacular. We wished it had come with more bread but the ham by itself was like a prosciutto but even better!! Finally, even though we were quite full we decided to have the dessert of cornbread with huckleberry and sour cream ice cream. It was strangely good, as was everything here. We had a beautiful pomegranate digestif to finish off the evening and even with the extra alcohol the bill came out to about the $100 a person. It sounds ridiculously expensive, but for a New York restaurant that is so famous we felt like we got our moneys worth. This isn’t a particular stuffy or fancy restaurant, but it has a pleasant enough atmosphere. The service is excellent, the food is interesting and inspired and I’m not sure we could have asked for anything more!! If you are a foodie and you like to try different foods, this may be a good place to put on your list of places to try.",June 2018,Momofuku Noodle Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1030684-Reviews-Momofuku_Noodle_Bar-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Went back twice it was so good,"Love when there is a good, cheap margarita with good food! Mango margaritas are $7 and pomegranate are $10. The pomegranate was the best and we had our fair share. The absolute best part of the evening was the tacos. We tried the carnitas tacos and the sea bass tacos and couldn't decide which was better!! Also really enjoyed the fish ceviche bowl which was huge!! Highly recommend! It is clean and bright and the bartender is very friendly and helpful.

"Bland, old school, nothing exciting","I really don't have anything negative to say about this restaurant, but I don't have anything positive either. If you enjoy old school menu, and old school service then this is the place for you. If you are more like me and want exciting flavors and a challenging menu with interesting ingredients you probably won't be very impressed with this restaurant.
The atmosphere was pleasant enough. The menu was just so boring and the the food was just plain. I had the seafood risotto which was made with orzo not Spanish rice which would have been fine except that the saffron and garlic were so mild it really had very little flavor. The mussels in the risotto were ok, but the mussels in curry sauce for a appetizer were better (although still, very mild on flavor). My husband had the sea bass and was very disappointed, it was way too overcooked. Our guest had the steak and she was very happy with it. So, if you like steak or like old school style food, this is a very nice place.

Fabulous Hotel,"Love, love,love this hotel! The view from our room was beautiful. The room and the lobby were also beautiful and the staff was friendly without being obsequious. Genuinely nice hotel in a great location.I loved that our room opened up onto the ocean and we could hear the waves crashing below. I loved the firepit which was going in the day time and the evening. upon arrival I went for a run and the pathway to the ocean was right out our door. We were close to the aquarium and close to Carmel for dinner. The only disappointment was that the coffee shop was closed, but we were able to get coffee at the bar and the restaurant and it was just so nice to sit in front of the fireplace, inside and outside!

We love this place!,"We have been to this restaurant many times, but over Christmas we took a group of 6 of us after a show. They called and asked if we would like to preorder paella since it was a very late reservation. We had a few appetizers like grilled octopus, calamari and some artichokes to start with and they were all fine, but we ordered the lobster paella for 8 and it was literally out of this world!!! The lobster was perfectly flavored and cooked and the paella was really really good. We all couldn't get enough of the Soccarat on the bottom of the pan. We had lots of sangria, not the really sweet kind, but made with a dry red wine and it was perfect with the paella. This place is perfect for a group!! Not cheap, but worth every bite!

Very disapointing,"I really wanted to like this restaurant. I had heard so much about it, and it's famous chef and I really was looking forward to going.
We had reservations, but that didn't matter, we still had to wait for a table at 9 o'clock at night. We stood in a crowded bar while the live music drowned out any conversation we might have wanted to have. When we were seated, we could barely hear each other and were yelling down the table to talk to each other. At some point we all gave up trying to converse with each other.
The food was so average I have no idea what the fuss is about. The chicken wings were just chicken wings, the mussels were nothing special. The shepards pie was pitiful, really, it had no taste and really didn't make sense as a dish. The ribs were good, but nothing compared to ribs from the South.
The food was mediocre, really. I didn't get what was so special about the place or the food. It was expensive and definitely not worth it. I really can't imagine ever wanting to go back to this restaurant.",January 2018,Red Rooster,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d2005333-Reviews-Red_Rooster-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Excellent!,"I must admit that this type of food is usually not my go to on a special evening but we had out of town friends visiting and we were looking for a place for a pre theater meal and this was in the perfect location. We were fortunate to go there during nice weather and we sat outside on their lovely patio. There were so many things on the menu that looked delicious but because it was so early in the evening we decided to just share a bunch of appetizers. We started with the raw oysters, which were very nice and then moved on to the taboon trio of dips (cauliflower hummus, baba ghanoush, and spicy feta dip. All were excellent as was the bread that miraculously kept getting refilled. The absolute best thing we ordered was the charred octopus, it was truly unbelievable, so tender and so much flavor. We also loved the crab shwarma, the morrocan meatballs and the squid. Very large appetizer portions made so there was more than enough for everyone to share. For dessert we had the pear Ella, the Malabi millefeuille and the pistachio and gjandujia ice cream. The pear Ella was by far the best although we really did enjoy everything. Aside from wonderful food, and the great atmosphere, the cocktails were terrific. Best of all, the service was really, really good. The servers were efficient and nice and when we had to leave to go to our show we had no problem getting out of there. We will definitely go back to Taboon!",September 2017,Taboon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d7242953-Reviews-Taboon-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
