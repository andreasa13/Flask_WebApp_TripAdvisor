Home and Authentic,"Amazing First Time dining experience!

I really love the home vibe, like going to someone's house for dinner. The atmosphere is very warm, welcoming and inviting.

The food is high quality with taste and flavor authentic. The Butter Chicken is silky, creamy, smooth with a perfect balance of sweet, salty and the right amount of spicy kick to it. Must pair it with the Garlic Naan - I must say one of the Best I've had - to soak up all that saucy goodness.
