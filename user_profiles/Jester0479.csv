Decent location but business hotel,"I stayed here for a leisure trip and wanted a brand I was familiar with. I found the hotel quiet, convenient enough to the sites and historical areas, and with plenty of good eats nearby and a good rooftop bar for late drinks. But the hotel seems to cater to a professional/business clientele; didn’t feel like a tourist type place to me. I did have some waits at the lobby desk too, which were daily since my key card didn’t work each evening. Nice place overall, but there are a lot of smaller ones in the area that looked good too.",September 2019,Novotel Istanbul Bosphorus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293974-d8547177-Reviews-Novotel_Istanbul_Bosphorus-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",hotels,3.0,4.5
Fantastic views,The base of the trail is about a half-hour walk from central Athens and it’s another 20 mins or so to the top. Well worth it for the panoramic views of the city!,October 2019,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
The original Olympic stadium,"Worth a visit just to see how large the stadium is—quite a feat for its time. The ticket is extra though, not included in the 7-site pass.",October 2019,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Worth a visit just for its scale,It's hard to appreciate how grand the Parthenon is until visiting and walking around it; I'd seen plenty of photos but they don't do it justice. And they're doing a good job with the renovation by keeping it low-key (not a bunch of scaffold obstructing views) and making the new pieces a lighter color so it's easy to tell what's original vs. added.

Lives up to the hype,"It's the Acropolis, what really needs to be said...but this lived up to its popularity. Lots of trails around the slopes make for good exploring and seeing the sights from different angles, though it's a shame some were roped off when I went.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
New museum with amazing city layout underneath,"Good layout, with plenty of space and well-lit exhibits. There were a lot of people entering all day but it never felt too crowded. As good as the inside exhibits are, the ancient city layout underneath is really worth plenty of time and was my favorite part of the museum.",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Highly recommend, great stay","Great hotel! I stayed a few nights and booked last-minute, so I wasn't too sure what I was getting into. But I could hardly have been happier with the room and location; it's one of my all-time best hotel finds. My room was the size of a large studio apartment and with all the amenities, which I did not expect. The owners were great and took time to explain the hotel and area, and they took time to discuss the various island tour options, which was helpful--and I'm glad I took their advice. (Definitely do the 3-island day cruise, btw.) One of the main restaurant strips is the next street up, so meals and snacks are super easy to walk to. The Acropolis, museum, and main sights are only several minutes walk away, such that I could go back to my room for lunch breaks and rest.

I tend to be a light sleeper and am sensitive to noise, so I was a little concerned about staying next to a busy street and near several restaurants--but this hotel opens onto a quiet side street and I heard no noise during my stay save the rare door closing from the neighbor. And I was even on the ground floor!",October 2019,Acropolis Stay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d12606994-Reviews-Acropolis_Stay-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Great hotel in downtown Fujairah,"Fantastic hotel! I stayed just one night, and having never been to Fujairah, I wasn't sure what to expect. But the area and the hotel both impressed me.

Staff was friendly and fast, never had to wait in a line for anything. Rooms were comfy and quiet, never heard any outside noise during my evening, and spacious--I was upgraded to a king bed suite that was larger than apartments I've lived in. It's on a main road so it's easy to find, and the 24-hr gas station next door is convenient for grabbing small items. There's also a small cafe and restaurant in the lobby. Overall, the hotel is small but had the basics, and I didn't have to walk 10 kilometers or up and down mazes of hallways to get to my room.

Perhaps the one drawback I can find is that the pool closed at 8 pm, just before I arrived, but I think that's common for wintertime anyway.

Rotana hotels have always taken good care of me and this one was no exception. I'd stay here again for sure!",December 2018,Nour Arjaan by Rotana - Fujairah,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g311321-d1905202-Reviews-Nour_Arjaan_by_Rotana_Fujairah-Fujairah_Emirate_of_Fujairah.html,"Fujairah, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,4.5
Interesting parts but crowded,"Yes, the queue moves fast, but that's still a pretty long queue and lots of time spent standing if you go mid-morning like I did. Seeing the military processions and the reverence Ho Chi Minh is treated with was interesting though. I only spent a short time here as part of a day tour, so there are parts of the museum I didn't get to see.",November 2018,Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d311064-Reviews-Ho_Chi_Minh_Mausoleum-Hanoi.html,"Hanoi, Vietnam",attractions,3.0,4.0
Interesting Vietnam university history,"Good for a short visit to learn about Vietnamese university history, how the first one started in the 11th century, etc. It was a bit crowded when I visited though, so it's not a great place to take a lot of photos.",November 2018,Temple of Literature & National University,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d311083-Reviews-Temple_of_Literature_National_University-Hanoi.html,"Hanoi, Vietnam",attractions,4.0,4.5
Water puppet show with live music,"This is the place to see a water puppet show. Others have recorded music and a more touristy feel, but the show I saw here had live musicians and singers, eight total (not counting those behind the stage, of course). Part of the show was watching the traditional instruments being used to create all of the various sounds for the show. Amazing! A must-see in Old Quarter.",November 2018,Thang Long Water Puppet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d455018-Reviews-Thang_Long_Water_Puppet-Hanoi.html,"Hanoi, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,4.0
Lots of cool buildings and exhibits,"What a fun place! I came here on a Hanoi day tour and had never heard of it before my visit, but I'm glad the tour stopped here. Lots of neat houses and mini villages to visit and learn about, background on the many (90+) Vietnamese ethnic groups, lots of outdoor space to walk around and see some of ancient Vietnam's lifestyle. I would have liked to have spent more time here, 2-3 hours or so.",November 2018,Vietnam Museum of Ethnology,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d447352-Reviews-Vietnam_Museum_of_Ethnology-Hanoi.html,"Hanoi, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good but crowded,"This place serves up super good pho, and the constant crowd here (passed by a few times, ate once) implies that lots of tourists and locals would agree. There's not much room at the table to eat, when you do get a seat, and you probably won't know any of your cozy new neighbors anyway, so for a chill, relaxing dinner experience, look elsewhere.

Great place but overvisited,"Great views that you can see in few, if any, other places in the world. Good overnight cruise options with all kinds of excursions. Worth the trip up from Hanoi to visit for sure. I took a 2d1n cruise and am glad I did, as I enjoyed the easy pace and extra down time to relax on the boat, swim, kayak, and just chill for a couple days.

But, don't be fooled by the crystal-clean air and water in those cover photos. That wasn't my experience anyway. The bay itself is beautiful and remote, but it is also a little polluted and crowded with boats, even in the farther reaches. The air seemed hazy, and that does obstruct the picturesque-ness of the views from the boat. Worth a visit, yes, but don't expect it to be the remote slice of pristine wilderness it perhaps once was.",November 2018,Bai Tu Long Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293923-d2155607-Reviews-Bai_Tu_Long_Bay-Halong_Bay_Quang_Ninh_Province.html,"Halong Bay, Vietnam",attractions,4.0,5.0
Great 2d1n cruise in Bai Tu Long Bay,"Having never been on a cruise of any kind before, I didn't know what to expect. I figured this would be sparse but comfy rooms, great views, probably a little boring, and well worth the time spent. Except for the last one, I was wrong on all counts!

The Dragon Legend 2 junk is more luxurious than I expected. Great rooms, good beds, quiet, big bathroom, you name it. The meals and facilities were top-notch. It was a good respite of luxury amongst my other travels in the area. I didn't feel out of place as a lone ranger either, as there were several other soloists on the boat as well.

Our tour guide, Wang, did a great job keeping the group engaged, even borrowing so many cameras--don't know how he kept track of them all--and taking our photos during the kayaking. And Milk Man's energy and magic shows were fun between events and after dinner. He did great to keep us on our toes throughout! The engineer's solo was a nice surprise, and even the captain got involved with some tai chi. Great crew.

The views though...frankly, the bay views and overall environs were less than expected. I found the bay to be a bit littered and polluted--seemed to be a haze in the air, not crisp like photos I'd seen--and there were plenty of other boats sharing the waters with us even for the overnight portion. Don't get me wrong, the bay was nice to see for certain, but it wasn't the grand spectacle I'd had in mind since learning about Ha Long Bay several years ago. (I was happy to learn during the cruise that the government will start restricting cruise ships considerably in 2020. More controls are needed!)

Overall, the bay is worth the visit and the overnight cruise option was well worth my money spent--and Dragon Legend 2 is a choice boat to see the bay from!",November 2018,Dragon Legend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293923-d7309520-Reviews-Dragon_Legend-Halong_Bay_Quang_Ninh_Province.html,"Halong Bay, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,5.0
Good atmosphere,"We stopped here a couple times, good place to sit on the upper decks and enjoy some dessert and coffee. Plenty of selection and good coffee.

Good comfy hotel in quiet location,"We stayed here on bookend nights for some trekking. The rooms are a bit small but plenty comfortable, and the facilities work well. The location is good, easy walking distance to eats, clubs, markets. (But tuk-tuks and cyclos are readily available most everywhere in Luang Prabang anyway.) Even with a large tour group also staying in the hotel during our last night, the place stayed quiet and peaceful, and the service was fast and friendly.

The breakfast in the morning was simple and same for all (fruit, bread, eggs to order, coffee/tea), but it was good and there was plenty of it.

The wifi was quite weak, but welcome to Laos--all the more reason to get out and enjoy!

I'd recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",December 2018,Davita Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295415-d12154921-Reviews-Davita_Boutique_Hotel-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html,"Luang Prabang, Laos",hotels,4.0,3.0

"Great staff, centrally located","Oriental Suites served as my home base of sorts for a few excursions in the area. The comfy and quiet rooms are nice, but the staff is exceptional and made my stays one of the highlights of my vacation. From last-minute airport pickups and tour bookings to fast check-in to local recommendations to having my stored luggage already waiting in my room each time I arrived, the folks here took good care of me throughout and were a joy to work with.

The location in central Old Quarter is quite good, couple minutes' walk to the Ho Hoan Kiem lake, lots of eats, shops, water puppet theatre, weekend night market (literally right outside the door), etc. Somehow the rooms stay quiet too; I never had trouble with noise or sleep.

Very happy with this hotel, would certainly recommend it and will stay again if/when I return!",November 2018,Oriental Suites Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293924-d943311-Reviews-Oriental_Suites_Hotel_Spa-Hanoi.html,"Hanoi, Vietnam",hotels,5.0,5.0
DDQ Wild! in northern Thailand,"I chose this trip based on past experience (I'd hiked with Ben before) and a desire to get away from crowded sites and routes for a while. And it was a great experience! Spent several days with Ben and the crew exploring the caves and mountains of Thailand, places easily reachable from Chiang Mai yet so remote and untouched we pretty much had them to ourselves. Fun week of kayaking and spelunking and hiking and journaling about our time there, capped by some Chiang Mai discovery and checking out the local markets. Ben was a great leader who knew his material and the lay of the land, the great mountain lodge was one of a kind (glad I bought the book!), and the range of ages and experiences in the group made for an enjoyable week of getting to know one another.This was my second trip with Ben, and I'd recommend Elevated Trips to anyone who's up for some off-the-beaten-path adventures!** Visited in May 2016",May 2018,Elevated Trips,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g494940-d12621335-Reviews-Elevated_Trips-Xining_Qinghai.html,"Xining, China",attractions,5.0,5.0
