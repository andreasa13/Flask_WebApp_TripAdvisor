Central hotel for Valletta,"La Falconaria is a boutique hotel in the heart of Valletta, conveniently located for the shops and the historic landmarks. The staff are friendly and polite. There is a varied breakfast menu and there is a restaurant onsite (the menu looked good but I didn’t eat there). The rooms are compact but the bed is comfy and there is a good sized walk in shower in the bathroom. There is a plunge pool and a small gym (which was rather warm!). My only issue was with the WiFi; it’s free but I had to constantly log back in to the network as soon as my phone was idle, which was a little irritating. Other than that, a lovely find.",March 2020,La Falconeria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190328-d11876435-Reviews-La_Falconeria-Valletta_Island_of_Malta.html,"Island of Malta, Malta",hotels,4.0,4.5

Weekday lunch,We were in Gatwick in between flights and booked a table here for lunch to while away a couple of hours. Our inbound flight was delayed but the restaurant were happy for us to turn up at any time prior to the kitchen closing at 14:15. We arrived around 13:45 and we were the only diners! Service was brisk - appetisers were brought at the same time as the main courses due to the kitchen closing.

Caters for a solo diner,I wasn’t sure I would get a table on a Saturday night but the place was quite quiet. The staff were very friendly and attentive.

Wouldn’t recommend - tasteless. Had to cover in tzatziki to make them edible. Thought I’d then follow them up with a chicken gyros (I’d had one when I was there before) but it took so long for someone to come and ask me what I wanted that I was past it.

The lime and polenta cake was yummy!",April 2017,Cobo Kiosk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2509150-d6632897-Reviews-Cobo_Kiosk-Cobo_Guernsey_Channel_Islands.html,"Guernsey, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Disappointed,"I've been to this restaurant on a number of occasions and usually been very happy - and full - with the food. I went 2 days ago and was very disappointed. We weren't welcomed as we walked in - a young guy was reading something at the desk and seemed rather put out that we were waiting to ask for a table. The table server was friendly and our drinks arrived quickly. We both ordered Sal's Favourite Pasta - rigatoni with meatballs and it's one of my favourites. However, it was cold when it arrived. We sent it back and the replacement wasn't much warmer. At that stage we just wanted to eat and leave. Such a shame as I have had some good food from here but now won't be rushing back.",March 2017,Two Meatballs in the Kitchen - Fort Myers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34230-d2002946-Reviews-Two_Meatballs_in_the_Kitchen_Fort_Myers-Fort_Myers_Florida.html,"Fort Myers, Florida",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Great setting,"Had a business breakfast meeting here; ideal in that it has plenty of parking, is near the airport and is suited for business travellers. The breakfast and brunch menus have a good selection of choices. The staff are polite and helpful. Would definitely recommend.",March 2017,The Farmhouse Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1096518-d581715-Reviews-The_Farmhouse_Hotel-Saint_Saviour_Guernsey_Channel_Islands.html,"Guernsey, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great for the business traveler,"I stayed here 3 years ago and don't regret coming back. The staff are friendly and attentive. The Veranda restaurant is open all day; the menu is typical hotel food but it is well presented and tasty. It's a breakfast buffet, and there are also buffets at lunchtime occasionally at night. You don't tend to give a credit card at check in so you'll have to pay as you go rather than charging things to your room. There's a nice covered outside seating area but beware the smokers!

The pool is an adequate size and wasn't busy when I was there. The rooms are a good size and are modern. I was in a standard room which was plenty big enough. There are also self catering apartments which have a kitchen, and tend to have a balcony. All rooms come with a safe.

My only criticism is that there was no hotel information in the room; you'd usually expect a folder telling you meal times, when the pool is open, how to get pool towels etc but you have to fend for yourself and ask at reception. A bit odd.

There is a complimentary shuttle to local malls and the Sandton Gautrain to get to the OR Tambo airport.",February 2017,The Capital 20 West,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g14946559-d2048966-Reviews-The_Capital_20_West-Morningside_Sandton_Greater_Johannesburg_Gauteng.html,"Morningside, South Africa",hotels,4.0,4.0
Good Italian cuisine,Went here for a business lunch. Was nice to sit outside but got very hot and there are no ceiling fans. Extensive menu. I had the spinach malfatti which was very tasty. Decent service and not overly priced.,February 2017,Tortellino D'Oro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312578-d2393780-Reviews-Tortellino_D_Oro-Johannesburg_Greater_Johannesburg_Gauteng.html,"Johannesburg, South Africa",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great for a business lunch,A really relaxing venue for lunch (and probably dinner). A varied menu to cater for all tastes. Some of the options weren't available but the chicken I had was delicious. Friendly waiting staff. Aircon was having trouble dealing with the humidity so it was a little warm but overall a really nice restaurant.,February 2017,Olive & Oil,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312608-d2385840-Reviews-Olive_Oil-Umhlanga_Rocks_KwaZulu_Natal.html,"Umhlanga Rocks, South Africa",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Really friendly welcome,"I stayed here 3 years ago and this trip I found the welcome just as warm and friendly as before. The room was a good size, with catering facilities. A good size walk in shower and a comfortable bed. Breakfast was made to order, again with a smile. Would highly recommend.",February 2017,Manaar House Bed and Breakfast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312608-d807725-Reviews-Manaar_House_Bed_and_Breakfast-Umhlanga_Rocks_KwaZulu_Natal.html,"Umhlanga Rocks, South Africa",hotels,4.0,5.0
