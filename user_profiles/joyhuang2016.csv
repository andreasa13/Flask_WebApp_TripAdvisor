Best restaurant in ubud,"From the beginning till end, the dishes are delightful. The tables were vastly spaced which made it more private and safe during this covid 19 time. The dishes are not only beautiful but so delicious. The restaurant gave generous complimentary food which are nice but not overwhelming. We would definitely come back. Excellent job indeed.",December 2020,Apéritif Restaurant & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297701-d15147175-Reviews-Aperitif_Restaurant_Bar-Ubud_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html,"Ubud, Indonesia",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Too much of everything,Too much of everything. 2.5 hrs turn to 4 hrs. Savory is not that impressive. The best one is only the croquet. The sweet consist maybe 70 percent of the 21 small dishes. The sweet parts were mostly chocolates. A nightmare when you have kids with you. Service is great but very slow. Everything is overdo and the pocky copy just taste like pocky.,December 2020,Room 4 Dessert,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1933359-d6784249-Reviews-Room_4_Dessert-Kedewatan_Ubud_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html,"Kedewatan, Indonesia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Two bedroom villa,"A great stay at six senses uluwatu. First time experiencing six senses property and amazed at the space the provided for the two bedroom villa. Cleanliness is great, the living room is spacious, the bathroom contain outdoor and an indoor shower. The master bedroom is beautiful. The breakfast need more variety but they are generally taste okay. Tried the dinner at the restaurant and they are decent. The outdoor cinema is great! They children love it. Before dark, you can take a peek from above to below to see sea turtles from up there. It is nice to see a glimpse of the sea from a cliff hotel. The service is okay.
The only improvement they need is to clean the private pool more often and turn on the jacuzzi during the guests’ stay.",December 2020,Six Senses Uluwatu Bali,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g8366411-d14051137-Reviews-Six_Senses_Uluwatu_Bali-Uluwatu_Bali.html,"Uluwatu, Indonesia",hotels,5.0,4.5
5 bedroom villa,"The service was excellent, the butlers were very accomodating, very helpful.. however, management was negligent in maintaining the facilities on the property. The ac in one of the master bedroom wasn’t working when we checked in. The home theatre was totally broken.
The place is a bit dark at night and they did not give enough lights
The view from the front is amazing.",December 2020,The edge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1380108-d1846942-Reviews-The_edge-Pecatu_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html,"Pecatu, Indonesia",hotels,4.0,5.0
Safe Getaway and diving,"A very good place to getaway from the situation of lock down. Stay in the two bedroom villa with private pool. The place is huge and fit 4 of us confortably. The place is so worth the price ( i got it from wang_baliluxuryhotel) . Came with two kids and we enjoyed the pool, the kitchen and the superb breakfast. Nasi goreng and mie goreng is great. The place is quiet due to many restriction at other cities. A great place if you want to dive. The boat pick you just right infront of the breakfast place .
The villa just need a bit of renovation on some part such as the electrical outlets that doesnt work at some parts. The amenities such as shampoo need to be improved. Otherwise the service is superb",September 2020,Fairmont Sanur Beach Bali,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297700-d3396712-Reviews-Fairmont_Sanur_Beach_Bali-Sanur_Denpasar_Bali.html,"Sanur, Indonesia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Long weekend vacation,"An option for a quiet vacation with your family. A glamping experience in style. Comfy bed, comfortable bed but slippery floor. Good service from the hotel. The private pool is small but with a view. Good dinner at the restaurant. Breakfast atmosphere is awesome but bread needs an upgrade. Croissant is small and hard. But others are quite acceptable. Ginger tea is my favorite! Good diving season. Awesome view",August 2020,Menjangan Dynasty Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g12250003-d10437730-Reviews-Menjangan_Dynasty_Resort-Pejarakan_Gerokgak_Buleleng_Regency_Bali.html,"Pejarakan, Indonesia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Bad service,Food is average and overrated. Seabass is ok. Unfortunately the person Gave a wrong dish to the party and put the right one on the table and say “lets see what happen” when we try to give it back. End up charging us for their mistake . A friend ask if they could change the side dish and they change without telling that they would be charged extra 10 dollar. A nice atmosphere with bad service. Too bad.

Average food,We had our breakfast and the food is just okay. No big deal about it although it was recommended by the hotel. Fall below expectation.

Best best restaurant in santorini,"Best food so far from what we experience. We love every meal we ordered. The calamari is tender and lightly seasones, risotto with seafood is great but what we love most is the pork. Great service with a smile too.

Nice renovated room,"A modern renovated room with computerized shower, curtain... choose the new renovated room instead of the old one even though it might be smaller. We enjoy the morning jog infront of the hotel that led to beautiful jogging path. The sunset from the balcony is amazing! We were very glad to get the 17th floor. The downside about this hotel is the food. They need to improve the quality and taste of the food. During the big event, one of the lift was broken and thus so many people wait for the slow lift that stop almost at every floor. Otherwise it is quite a decent large hotel especially for a big event.",October 2019,Rodos Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635613-d252407-Reviews-Rodos_Palace-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",hotels,4.0,3.5
An interesting place to stay,A cave type accomodation at Santorini. We got a small jacuzzi which overlook a beautiful scenery. They have a small kitchen which is nice. The downside of the place is the distance it took us to the room. Be prepared with lots of stairs up and down. A porter will carry the luggages but we seriously felt bad for the porter but there is no other way to bring the luggages other than carry them.,October 2019,Liakada Oia Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482941-d6419896-Reviews-Liakada_Oia_Suites-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5

Amazing little hotel,"One of the best location just minutes away from acropolis by walking distance. Really good service with small details that we really appreciate. A welcome drink, a taste of alcohol at the room, chocolates and personalized notes. They have a great rooftop restaurant with amazing view and the food is not only looking pretty but they taste good too. Breakfast is decent and displayed nicely. If we are back to Athens, we will definitely come back to this hotel.

Beautiful dinner with gorgeous view,Awesome dinner with awesome view. We ordered the sourdough bread which was presented beautifully. We ordered the oxtail and the lamb which both are awesome. Would definitely recommend this place. The only downside is the toilet which you have to go down by lift to reach it. And while we were dining there was another guest who was loud and bang the table so many times. Otherwise it is a perfect fine dining place.,October 2019,SENSE Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12484364-Reviews-SENSE_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Awesome hotel with good price,One of my favorite concept hotel. Nice location that allows me to just go around conveniently. The trx tools and the yoga ball is delightful. Check in is fast as well. The lobby is not exactly pretty but it does not matter to us. There is recreational room with pingpong table which we use during rainy day when going out is not convenient. They gave us a free water bottle too.,July 2019,EVEN Hotel New York - Times Square South,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d7778097-Reviews-EVEN_Hotel_New_York_Times_Square_South-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,5.0,4.5

Pleasantly surprised,"Would give a top notch for their hospitality and attention. The reception would call us to get ready for a check in. Although a little distance from the dive site we are happy with the cleanliness and the simplicity the resort offer. The linen is soft and the room is cool and comfortable. The open shower is great too. The diving center is convenient. The food is decent.
What can be improved would be a cart to bring our diving gears to the room instead of us having to carry back and forth. Also the stairs to the room cause both of our young kids to get injured because of the lack of lighting in the area and the inconsistent height of the stair.
Otherwise it is an excellent choice for divers to stay in tulamben area.",June 2019,Scuba Seraya Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g469406-d941643-Reviews-Scuba_Seraya_Resort-Tulamben_Bali.html,"Tulamben, Indonesia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Dive trip,The best location for diving trip. A decent hotel with friendly service. Perhaps with idul fitri they lack of human resource but they try their best and we are satisfied.

Comfortable,"Went to Jakarta for an engagement party. The hotel is conveniently located adjacent to senayan . What i love most about the hotel is the layout of the room. The shower and the bes too are superb. The gym is great too with variety of machines to exercise. The breakfast vary and quite awesome especially the avocado speciality that time. The only downside to the hotel is that, it might be noisy at night and in the morning. Perhaps the windows are not exactly noise proof and the hotel face the street. Nothing much can be done except perhaps next time should request the room that face a more quieter area.",March 2019,Fairmont Jakarta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294229-d7182851-Reviews-Fairmont_Jakarta-Jakarta_Java.html,"Jakarta, Indonesia",hotels,4.0,5.0

One of the best mie kwangtung,Always the place to go for a quick meal. My favorite is mie kwangtung and mushroom teriyaki. My husband loves the nasi goreng jawa. The new menu which is the pangsit goreng is a must. I like the complimentary prawn crackers which are perfect to accompany my meal.

Best japanese food in town,"Went there with my family. Enjoy every meal. We ordered beef wasabi, salmon belly teriyaki, Teppan tofu, salmon sashimi(best quality in town) , gindara miso and salmon chasuke. They are all super good. Great service and peaceful surrounding.

Downgraded teppanyaki 😖,"Was not our first visit to nishimura and were looking forward for a nice family teppanyaki dinner with the kids. At first we were greeted with a solemn chef who just use soya and butter for all of the ingredients we ordered. There was no entertaining cook as the usual in teppanyaki elsewhere and we were disappointed with the taste because everything taste almost the same! The best amongst all was the banana. The others were either greasy tasteless or just salty. When he finished with the banana flambe (the dessert) the chef went off and after the bill he probably realized he missed on the chicken we ordered. They just shoved a box after we received the bill and told us it was chicken teriyaki. We never ordered chicken teriyaki it was suppose to be for teppanyaki. One of us were sick and had no energy to argue. No apology received from the restaurant nor the teppan chef. We still pay for the teppanyaki chicken regardless of the one we actually received.
I wrote an email to the hotel regarding the incident , not to get any compensation but to remind the hotel to upgrade their service. I was at least expecting a reply or apology but i did not get a reply up till today. What a pity a hotel such as shangri-la surabaya gave such bad services. The years we have invested and believed in the hotel and its restaurant just got crumble in a night from the treatment we got.

So so food,"Good pizza, average food, nice ambience. three of us got stomach ache from the food. Most probably the sauce for the fried chicken. Some of the food capcay and kwetiaow were not great. The only food that is good is the seabass and the aglio olio (not in the menu)",December 2018,MadeInItaly - Ristorante Italiano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1777483-d2008791-Reviews-MadeInItaly_Ristorante_Italiano-Labuan_Bajo_Flores_East_Nusa_Tenggara.html,"Flores, Indonesia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
New resort with lots of potential,"I have a mixed review about this resort.
The good stuff:
1. Great sunset
2. Friendly service for bfast
3. Good and clean room service. They left ample of water and towel supply.
4. Great spacious bathroom
5. Good check out procedure
6. Great comfortable bed with nice temperature
7. Clean pool although small
8. Nice lobby

Things that still need improvement
1. Definitely f&b. The taste were mostly bland except for nice warm bread. In one of the dinner one of the family member got stomach ache from not properly cooked squid (bbq). Overly expensive as well.
2. The lifeguard at the pool did not even have a band aid in hand and had no clue. A waiter actually gave one for my daughter when she bumped into one of the staircase nearby the pool. It showed that the lifeguard is untrained
3. A small hole on top of my room (closet) drip water once in a while that drip on top of my luggage
4. Miscommunication between hotel and jetty that create a misunderstanding between the security who appeared snobbish and unfriendly towards our diving tour (ayana had not open any diving center yet so we had to find one from outside)
5. Gymn on the first time and no service guy was there. No towel, no water bottle and the room felt like a sauna. Gymn for the second time and there is a friendly guy offering water and towel. So there is an improvement there.
6. The breakfast had awesome french toast that soaked long enough on the first day and second day onward it had never been the same. One of the breakfast we had, we did not even receive the egg we ordered. Today we receive it on time.
7. There are lots of mistake when giving rooms... some room requested such connecting room
8. The boat reserved for specific date was given to another guest and no apology received. We had to fight for it to get it to another day

Things that i would suggest:
1. Most guests would come to labuan bajo for snorkeling or diving experience so make it friendly with all the services for wetsuits, diving gear etc ready.
2. There should be Beverages offered for swimming pool area , sunblock as well
3. Better music for the lounge
4. Better communication between staff
5. Friendlier and more experienced staff who manage booking.
6. More shuttle to the city area

So much potential for this resort but since it is a fairly new there are still so much that need to be improved.",December 2018,AYANA Komodo Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1777483-d14167975-Reviews-AYANA_Komodo_Resort-Labuan_Bajo_Flores_East_Nusa_Tenggara.html,"Flores, Indonesia",hotels,4.0,4.5
A chic restaurant,Great friendly service . Food is just ok but the burrata is good. The place is a cool place to hang out. The downside of the experience is the strange sweet smell outside that is personally strangely adjusting my appetite to not wantinv to eat (but perhaps i am more of a sensitive person). My advice is for more warm natural smell just choose indoor.,December 2018,Barbacoa Bali,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608486-d5292650-Reviews-Barbacoa_Bali-Kerobokan_North_Kuta_Bali.html,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Not a bad pizza,The pizza was not bad and quite interesting. Seemed to be a famous place to go. They serve big portion and we could do half half for one order. The down side was that when we came the place was not cleaned properly.

I would praise Nick at the reception area who without being told attended to our need with smile. The beds are small but comfortable and clean enough. They have restaurants in the hotel with michelin star which is quite pricey but we did not have time to try that.

Beach villa,"First time to Menjangan for my birthday with my loved ones. The place was as i expected, close to nature. Beware of creepy bugs from small ants to big ants, spiders and fly. We rented the beach villa and the location is superb. Waking up to see the sunrise right in front of the villa is simply breath taking. A few hiccups; things like extra bed (aka taking away our sofa and convert it into a bed and charging us 450 ribu) while endless different bugs creep into the sofa bed aka extra bed made us have to complain about it. The person in charge was defensive at first but eventually gave us a proper extra bed that is bug free and not taking away our sofa. Also a broken air conditioner but was taken care swiftly. In exchange they gave us discount on our snorkeling trip and a free one hour massage. Otherwise the service in the hotel is excellent. Everyone is friendly and accomodating. The meal both breakfast and dinner are excellent. The deers, monkeys, squirel, chicken were roaming around freely in front of the villas which are simply wonderful. In front of our villas if you look closely you would find live crustaceans on the rocks.
At night We had a special place for birthday celebration and the hotel gave us a cake that surprisingly is super good!
What you must do is snorkeling or diving. Those colorful corals and variety of fishes are breath taking. We enjoyed our trip with pak wayan who was passionate in what he did.
This place is the place to go when life in the city really gets into you.

The bimbimbap is good as well.

Good xiao wang fu restaurant at last,"This original place is the best amongst other xiao wang fu. The food we ate were incredably good and savory. We love the string bean, the fish, the three layered pork and spicy chicken. Would definitely come back to this.
The other branch which was beside the river was dissapointing and touristy. We were very dissapointed as the waiters only cared about selling and kept on pointing to the most expensive item in the menu whenevr we asked a question. They charged 50rmb for one small bottle of evian. It was indicated in the menu but they did not specify the volume. The peking duck there was small and felt like half instead of one whole duck. Really brought down xiao wangfu reputation but fortunately we came back to tge original place and decided to give it a chance and true enough this place is superb compared to the other branch.",June 2018,BeiJing XiaoWangFu (GuangHua Road),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294212-d1205819-Reviews-BeiJing_XiaoWangFu_GuangHua_Road-Beijing.html,"Beijing, China",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Not worth it . Go to other Xiao Wang Fu,Very tourist feeling. The service is bad and the beijing duck is not impressive. They said the duck is one duck but come out small perhaps only half duck. The best from all is the fried spare rib but find other xiao wangfu. Too expensive. One water cost 48! We will never come back. The waiter keeps on pointing to most expensive item in the menu.

A potential good hotel but need better service and maintenance,"This hotel is potentially good. What we love is the layout of the room that is airy and the bed is comfortable. However unfortunately when we checked in, we got a room with broken air conditioner (we were sweating when we slept) and no cold water (yes, there is only hot water!). When we requested that our room be in the same room as the others they failed to make it. When we requested that the extra bed ready in the room when we checked in, they failed to do it as well. Around 3-4 am we heard phones vibrating that were not ours but we found out belong to the neighbor room! The wall must be so thin. We request for a room change which is much better. But since it is very near to the lift, every morning we could hear the constant lift sound every minutes which are annoying!
The pool is alright although need some cleaning as i swam i saw a bundle of dirty hair floating around the pool. We could rent the towel easily but goggles are charged!
I also found out that the reply of every comments in the tripadvisor are simply cut and paste by the management without any attempt to redeem or fix the problems. Budget perhaps and inability to give any promises.
So expect budget services and chose your room carefully. Away from the lift and ask them to make sure the air conditioner are working!",April 2018,Swiss-Belhotel Cirebon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297707-d5122654-Reviews-Swiss_Belhotel_Cirebon-Cirebon_West_Java_Java.html,"Cirebon, Indonesia",hotels,3.0,4.0
Went on the wrong day,"The spring hot pool filled with too many people. The slides look old. Kinda gross. So we decided to go to the cold pool which is alright but no proper facility to bathe. Look old and desperate need for renovation!

Tokyo marathon,Best location for tokyo marathon as the start line is just in front and save the runner a lot of energy. The hotel is strategically located near metro oedo line and easy access to everywhere interesting. Nearby lots of restaurants and pharmacy and supermarket and a 5 min walk to a garden if you want to do some running. Make sure ask for a non smoking room if you are a non smoker. The bed is hard and the wall is thin. So depend on which floor but at night might be a bit noisy. The concierge is very helpful and friendly. There are plenty of restaurants but quite pricy.,February 2018,Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g14133673-d304305-Reviews-Keio_Plaza_Hotel_Tokyo-Nishishinjuku_Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Nishishinjuku, Japan",hotels,4.0,4.0

A pleasant surprise,"Went here accidentally and found great warm pizzas, one of the best we have tasted in rome. Also the dessert that was recommended was superb and tasty.

Amazing chapel,"One of the best chapels i have ever seen in Europe. Interesting parts at the beginning about Egypt and beautiful architectual buildings surrounded by beautiful and delicate paintings at most of the places. The chapel is a wonder with Michaelangelo’s painting and Raphael’s paintings that are not only pretty but meaningful and spiritual.
Please reserve your tickets. Would be a pain if need to wait over 2 hours to just get in. We used quo vadis tour to skip the lines since it was raining and we had not had our reservation.
