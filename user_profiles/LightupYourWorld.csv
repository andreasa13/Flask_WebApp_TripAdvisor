Lovely Staff let down by poor maintenance,"I booked a Spa day here but was disappointed however there were some positives

Positives:
Friendly Staff
Nice Lunch
Good Massage

Negatives
The place was cold - very cold for a spa retreat. The ladies toilet on the half-landing had a hold in the window through which the wind howled. There had at some time been a ventilating fan which was now disconnected but the fins were all broken which basically meant that there was a hole through which you could see the house opposite. NEWSFLASH - what are you thinking guys get it fixed a hole in the window of the ladies toilet area is totally unacceptable. On top of this the air con in the changing rooms was blowing cold air. Your maintenance guys are really letting you down. I left before I got my second treatment of the day because I was so cold. Would I go back?

Business Hotel,"We were on a holiday to celebrate our wedding anniversary, due to a mix up we were booked into the wrong hotel. This hotel is in the middle of a business area of Tokyo and although it is close to the train station unless you can read and speak Japanese well this is not the hotel for you. This is not a tourist hotel and was totally the wrong place to be if you are a tourist.The hotel itself was tired looking and reminded me of a poor quality travelodge. The staff struggled to communicate with us. We went to reception one day to ask about ordering a taxi and the staff thought we wished to book out of the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants and a supermarket nearby so you won't starve. The staff do try but few could speak English and there was little tourist information in English available or any other language for that matter). Would I return to this hotel - no.
