Delicious,We loved this restaurant. Food was perfect. Service was outstanding. Loved the ambiance. We did show up without a reservation which you need here but they were accommodating.

Wonderful Experience,We loved our stay at Aparthotel Arai. The location is close to everything. The staff working the front desk was always very friendly and professional. The hotel is beautiful. I believe it had been an old palace refurbished. Our room was spacious and always very clean. We felt very comfortable like being in our own home when we returned from a long day of sightseeing. The bathroom was beautiful and the shower was the best I have ever used. Lots of water. The towels were huge and thick. Our ceilings were very high and loved the original refinished hardwood floors.,March 2019,Aparthotel Arai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d3971172-Reviews-Aparthotel_Arai-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,5.0,5.0
Love this hotel,Beautiful contemporary design in a very old historic building with lovely views from our room. Staff is very nice and complimentary breakfast fabulous. The location is amazing as seen in last photo. Located next to the Prague Bridge and very close to the Prague Castle.,October 2018,Bishop's House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d276521-Reviews-Bishop_s_House-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,5.0,5.0
