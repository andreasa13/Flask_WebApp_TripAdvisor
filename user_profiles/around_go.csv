Not a great choice,"Good: the room was clean and the bed is very comfort
Bad: the fridge was empty. Very hude staff, they were not happy at all with simple questions. Poor breakfast, only one juice (not natural) and not many options, also extremely busy, they would need another restaurant for all those clients that they have from Turkish airlines",December 2019,Mercure Istanbul West Hotel & Convention Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293974-d7779380-Reviews-Mercure_Istanbul_West_Hotel_Convention_Center-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",hotels,2.0,3.0
Just good,"Great hotel, nothing to different from normal. Nice decor. The location isn't the best, seems to be a bit dodge. The hotel is clean and all staffs very friendly.
Breakfast average. The rooftop bar is extremely expensive but with a nice view",December 2019,Wyndham Grand Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d10961869-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Lovely view,"Perfect to visit on a sunny day, I would recommend to go at the end of the day to see the sunset. Just attention to the close time, as it changes throughout the year",December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Tasteless,"The food just didn't taste at all, was really plain. The Greek salad was just tomato's and a huge slice of feta cheese. At lest the staff was friendly",December 2019,Laluk Cafe-Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12660560-Reviews-Laluk_Cafe_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
