Great beach away from the strip!,"We had found the beach on google maps and then subsequently been recommended it by the hotel we were staying in. Its a ten minute drive from Malia but completely worth it. Its in a natural cove which means the sea is nice and warm for a swim. Sunbeds are 7euros for two which includes an umbrella or 5 euros for one sunbed and umbrella. The beach is so much less crowded than the ones in Malia and so much more peaceful. The beach has everything you could need. There are portoloos which were clean & a delicious food truck that sold cold drinks and snacks of all varieties at a really reasonable price. We had a hotdog, chicken gyros and drinks all for under ten euros. We will definitely be visiting again! If your in malia take the very short journey to this beach.",September 2020,Potamos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616162-d12212661-Reviews-Potamos_Beach-Malia_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great place on the beach,We ventured to Agios Nikolas one night from Malia for a change of scenery and a wander around the shops. We came across Basilco right on the waters edge and were certainly not disappointed. An Italian/ Greek theme there was a huge selection of pasta / pizza & traditional Greek food. We all opted for pasta and would definitely recommend it. Relish homemade bread straight from the oven was given on the house so don’t make the mistake we did and order a garlic bread too! Like everywhere we’ve visited in Greece the house wine was delicious. Well recommended if you are in the town we certainly enjoyed ourselves - thank you!,September 2020,Basilico,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189414-d8656143-Reviews-Basilico-Agios_Nikolaos_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing cocktails! Great for people watching!,"We were drawn in by its relaxed ambience right in the centre of the strip. The chairs are comfy and it was a perfect location to sit, have a cocktail, and people watch. Big selection of cocktails and they are extremely well made the bartender takes a lot of time and effort in to making them and you can taste it! The only disappointment for us was there was no wine list / wine at all but I suppose a wide selection of cocktails to make up for it. Cocktails are priced around 7-12 euros per drink and there were no offers of anything however for the location and the calmness of the bar it was brilliant to sit and watch the chaos of the Malia strip. We went almost every night and enjoyed all the cocktails we picked. Perfect place for an after dinner drink.",September 2020,Mango Cocktail Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616162-d10529361-Reviews-Mango_Cocktail_Bar-Malia_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Amazing pizza!,We walked passed the restaurants a number of times and were drawn in by the huge wood fired oven and delicious smell of freshly cooked dough. We were not disappointed and for 35 euros had three large pizzas water & wine. The menu is extensive but i would definitely recommend the pizzas. Really tasty unique recipes such as caramelised onions and feta as well as garlic bases.

Great food. Great staff,"The staff in this restaurant make it! The main greeter (an older man) was incredible friendly and the staff beyond him are helpful and so kind. Food is a little more limited that some of the Greek tavernas we have visited but there was definitely something for everyone. The soluvaki is a brilliant dish complimented with a bit of a everything (bread, potatoes, veg, pasta and vegetable soup). The house white is perfect and for a starter you are given bread with a beetroot moose with oil handmade at your table and it was delicious.

The food and atmosphere are out of this world!,Number one rated restaurant in Malia and you can tell why. Located just at the edge of the old town… the restaurant is always busy so would recommend booking but the setting is beautiful no matter where you sit. We didn’t book and so ended up with a table inside but the bare walls and lightly make the inside just as pretty as the outside. The menu is typical of a Greek Taverna and really good. Staff are friendly and helpful and recommended some of the dishes for us to try (including the strawberry & salmon). Price wise it is average of other Greek tavernas in the area and for 3 people with wine (house white is brilliant!) starters and mains you are looking at around 50euros. Would definitely recommend and if we end up back in Malia would definitely go again.,September 2020,Avli in Malia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g616162-d14113794-Reviews-Avli_in_Malia-Malia_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
So good we went there twice!,"Restaurant so good we ended up here twice in our week holiday. The first time we didn’t book and were sat out the front of the restaurant and the second time we did book and were sat in the garden. Wherever you sit the food is just as good so it’s neither here nor there but the garden is just slightly more secluded. The restaurant is a five minute walk out of the town but well worth it. Lovely (what appears to be) family run restaurant. Staff as so friendly and helpful and as well as a full Greek menu they have daily specials. The first time we visited we had starters and mains and it was about 50euros for 3 people including a litre of wine. The second time, similar price, but this time we had six appetizers as a tapas of sorts. Make sure you order something from the oven the veg and potatoes are great.

Beautiful food!,Absolutely brilliant place! The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming and the food is amazing. It is outside of the main town but only by a ten minute walk from the crossroads with mcdonalds so not massively out of the way and definitely worth it.

Pretty location great food!,By far the prettiest taverna was visited during our time in Crete. Situated right in the heart of the old town it was stunning. The restaurant stretches out across the square and outside the church which is beautifully lit up at night. The food was delicious and would definitely recommend their pasta. As all the tavernas we visited the dry house white was exactly what your looking for to compliment the Greek food. Make sure you take the time to come up to this taverna the atmosphere is magical.

Good food - it is what it is,Don't except too much but good food at a reasonable price. Wide variety and staff were really friendly. We ate in it once but walked passed multiple times and it always seems busy. Different theme nights advertised (i.e. Curry thursdays).

Poor customer service,"The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are clean and tidy, good showers. All beds are just twins pushed together.

The pool is clean, and plenty of sun loungers including 4 cabanas - all just on a first come, first served basis.

The bar/restaurant was open for lunch and breakfast, but not open in the evening. We were not informed of this prior to arrival.

There was a lack of staff at the hotel. The only person there all day is the very lovely lady running the pool bar. We arrived at 1200 and the bar lady had to show us to our rooms.

Unfortunately the hot water stopped working in our part of the hotel, and again due to the lack of staff, the only person to inform was the bar lady. It took 2 days to get fixed, so that was 2 days with no hot water and we weren’t offered anywhere else to shower - even though it wasn’t the whole hotel without hot water.
We also lost hot water for another day, some 3 days in total. Never received an apology or explanation, as there were no staff.

I know we traveled during COVID and some changes were to be expected, but having no Front of house staff, and no hot water is very poor.",September 2020,Notos Heights Hotel & Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616162-d1223276-Reviews-Notos_Heights_Hotel_Suites-Malia_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,2.0,4.5
Best thai food outside of thailand,"The best thai food.

At the moment they only have tables outside so the maximum people you can have to sit down is three due to the narrow street but we were lucky enough to be staying close by so we got a take away and had to on our terrace. The food was so good.

We had some spring rolls & satay chciken for starter followed by a chicken pengang curry, duck red curry & a pad thai. This would easily have fed 4!

You can get up and go into the corner to take photos of sunset, unless there are people at all the food tables. Not sure how the seating plan worked but we were sat up on stalls directly next to another group. The stalls werent massively comfy but you are in a cocktail bar so half expected. There is a happy hour (early drink i think they call it) where cocktails are 6.5euros other than that they are around 10euros. Staff friendly and attentative. It is what it is.

Beautiful church at the top that you can see from the whole of athens although this was shut when we went. & then a resturant/bar that we had a drink in before coming back down.

Some of the best Greek food we’ve had!!
Menu had a wide variety of choice all with a Greek twist. The waiter gave some recommendations for starter and we had the cheese and tzatziki which was lovely. & then had a range of mains including pasta & the tomahawk.

5* food for less than a fast food meal!,"Go there! You will not be disappointed!

We found it through searching, and came out as one of the top places to eat in Nice - & I can see why!

The owner, is eccentric, but in a nice way. He fretted us early and takes us through the menu plus the specials he had. Service with a smile, perfect English too.

Had a bacon cheeseburger and the Provence chicken special, both with chips/fries, a soft drink and a beer, all for €24.

The food is amazing and the fries were some of the best I've ever had!

We were the only customers, but he didn't crowd us or hassle us, checked the food was good and left us be.

It's a shame it's off the main streets, so not as much passing trade, but I personally think that adds to the ambience - away from the hustle & bustle, but by only 3-5 minutes.

An oasis in Phnom Penh,"A beautiful hotel - The staff make you feel like family and welcome you back every time you return to the property.

A 1950's hotel, enclosed with private gardens and a lovely half sunk pool - an oasis in the middle of the city. Surrounding the pool their are plenty of sunloungers and cabanas which are perfect to relax in after a day in Phnom Penh. Sun or shade there is a spot in the garden for everyone.

Location is great - the property is down a private road that has security 24/7 due to the embassy. There are plenty of restaurants and amenities within walking distance and the hotel can get you a friendly tuk tuk wherever else you need to go.

The rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious. Our only grumble would be our shower was over the bath and wasn't very powerful and not a 'rainfall' shower as described & The wifi is also a little slow but neither of these points would discourage us from staying again.

The breakfast was a la carte and you picked from a menu - plenty of choice and very tasty and it was a great start to the day sitting in the garden having coffee.

Could be great - but far from it,"Hmmm.
Where to start.

The hotel itself is about 7kms away from the town, and the beach they have is about 2kms by shuttle.

The hotel has some amazing facilities but it's starting to show its age.
The rooms are clean, but quite dated now, with lots of dark wood.
The views are amazing if you have an ocean view room.

The reception staff are less than helpful. Especially considering that the hotel was not even half full.
We had an issue with our room and the staff said they would move us. But moved us to a worse room, with less of a view as it was on a lower floor and looked out to another hotel.

I am a gold hotels.com customer and one of the perks at this hotel was a free room upgrade, subject to availability. I explained this to the staff who said that there was no availability. When I showed them online that there was availability for EVERY type of room in the hotel, I was begrudgingly upgraded.

Another perk that came with booking through expedia/hotels.com was the 1,000,000 VND towards drinks and food during our stay. Again the hotel refused to honour this, giving us a voucher to be used in a restaurant that they had closed (due to lack of hotel guests) then offered us another menu, which they had only around 20% of the dishes - with no meat options. The reception staff again were very unhelpful. I never did get the money towards food & drinks like I was promised.

Breakfast had a wide selection of food, however everything was very bland with no real flavour. Including the coffee - one thing Vietnam prides itself on is good coffee.
The same goes for the restaurant. We had to eat there the first night, as it was late after we eventually got our room sorted, and the hotel is quite away from restaurants & bars.

The hotel has potential to be good, but it is dated, the reception staff are rude & unhelpful and especially at the moment with the downturn in tourism seem to be driving customers away.",March 2020,Boton Blue Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293928-d13422454-Reviews-Boton_Blue_Hotel_Spa-Nha_Trang_Khanh_Hoa_Province.html,"Nha Trang, Vietnam",hotels,2.0,5.0

Railway robbery! Don't book,"Don't bother!

They claim that their trains are brand new (only 1 year old) and just painted on the outside to match the rolling stock on vietnamese railways - this is a lie! I don't know how you could paint a carriage to look about 20 years old with peeling paint. There was no mention on the outside of the carriage that it was laman express.

The carriage we were in had been decorated in the 90's. The toilet on our one was disgusting. Filthy dirty (even though we were at the start of the journey) the smell emanating from it went all the way along the corridor. We had to keep the door closed.
I managed to look at the toilets in the carriages on the standard vietnam carriages and they were brand new, clean and smelt clean - Laman Express claim to have the newest carriages that are only 1 year old.
The luggage storage area in our cabin was filthy. It made our bags and cases really dirty.

The bed was comfy but the covers felt damp. On the bed was the only mention of Laman Express anywhere - a small sheet placed over the covers.

I went to go & get a snack from the main dining cart but was refused exit from the Laman carriage. The guard would not let me leave, even though there was nothing to say I couldn't. Literally held prisoner in the carriage! Same went to try and use the cleaner toilet on the next carriage. Not allowed to leave the carriage, with no further explanation!

If you want privacy I would suggest buying 4 standard tickets for one of the 4 berths on the standard train - would still be half the price of the Laman Express.

Great place! Great price,"Found this place on a leaflet in the reception of our hotel and decided on an afternoon at the spa during our time in Nha Trang. We found it slightly cheaper on klook however there was offers on if you booked directly with the spa. We chose a private herbal mid spa and it was about £12.50pp. we took a taxi from our hotel and was dropped directly outside, we showed our voucher to reception and were swiftly shown inside to the private mud spas. Essentially it’s a bath tub full of warm mud. We went into the bath together and the signs say to stay in there for about 20 minutes. It was really good fun. The mud makes your float and it’s altitude quite an odd sensation. You the dry the mud in the sun and then wash it off. It your brave enough there’s a hydrotherapy wall- very strong! You then move to a jacuzzi for a five minutes before heading to the herbal bath. Again we were in it together. From there there are the swimming pools and waterfalls to use and enjoy. There’s are sunbeds all around the pools and waterfalls but when we made it to this point about midday most of them were gone. There are however loads of deck chairs which were free. From here you can spend the afternoon at the spa. It’s really pretty, really clean and a relaxing afternoon.

Our package included a towel and a swimsuit however the mud does seem to come off quite easily and didn’t damage any of my partners swimwear.

There is a restaurant and food and drink available delivered to your lounger and all very reasonably priced.

We thoroughly enjoyed our day here and we did spent 5hours + here.

We only booked at 5pm for the tour at 8am the next day. Mr Cu picked us up on time and was full of energy and enthusiasm. There was six on the tour in total and we went to the local market and then on to do some fishing in Bamboo boats.

"Beautiful place, beautiful views","The tallest religious building in Vietnam and it is stunning with a beautiful view over the perfume river. Behind the pagoda itself theres a few other structures and a small garden to wander around. You can go in the pagoda but there is a temple which you can go in. We spent about 45 minutes here soaking up the view. It is a religious site and there are monks who live there so you are requested to cover shoulders and knees.

Beautiful place - but huge! Wear walking shoes!,"Absolutely beautiful. We bought our ticket as a combo with two of the tombs. It was more expensive than what we had paid for other sites in Vietnam but it is the old city and it is beautiful. Do not underestimate how big it is though you can walk for ages. We spent about 2 hours at the old city wandering around and taking lots of photos. You can hire a guide but we went around on our own and there’s plenty of information explaining exactly what each room/ site was and the importance of it. There’s a few food and drink kiosks around the site slightly more expensive but you are in a tourist site.

Fantastic food, cold beer and the staff are very attentive. A lot of the staff are learning English at uni or college, so want to practice with you. It makes for a lovely relaxed atmosphere.

The food is amazing! Good portion sizes, well cooked and very well presented.
There is a great menu with a wide selection of Vietnamese food and some local dishes.

Great frozen yoghurt,"Found this place as we were walking about from Nimman to the city centre. Essentially it’s a desert shop: you get a bowl and you pay based on the weight.

We had four choice of yoghurt when we went; chocolate, strawberry, blueberry and vanilla. From there there is a huge selection of toppings from sweets & chocolate to fruit. You can then add sauce on top of all that. 

At the end you put your bowl on the scales and pay per 100g. It’s not cheap. We didn’t go mad and ended up paying about 200baht.

It is however very tasty and a fun concept. I wouldn’t bother returning due to the price but as we were passing and looking for something sweet it hit the spot.

There is a seating island in the shop and a couple of benches outside. It’s all very clean and modern and other than the price have no complaints.

The owner/ manager in particularly makes the effort to check you are okay and that your food is up to standard which is a really nice touch. 

 It’s a little bit out of the main town but easy enough to find. There is both an inside and outside seating area both really well decorated.

The pizza was about 300baht each (average) some a little more and some a little less but it was delicious. Drinks are pretty cheap : we had a large Chang (about 90 baht) and a house wine (120 baht).

Please don't tell everyone about this place! Amazing Secret in Hanoi,"We didn’t want to write a review on this place as we don’t want it full of tourists- it was brilliant. The owner is so friendly and you get the best view of the train.

We went during the week so if you head down who 1840 you’ll catch about 3 trains within the hour. This cafe is just south of Hanoi station and currently there’s no police or security so you can walk straight up the tracks.

Drinks are so cheap and we had some tapas like food which was so tasty!

The owner helps you take the photos you want and when you order a beer puts the bottle tops on the track which the train then flattens and you can keep as a souvenir - she was brilliant!

I would recommend this over and over again it’s everything you want and the train is terrifying but brilliant at the same time. The owner gives you warning when it is coming and explains about tucking your knees in so you don’t get hit!

The owners family are brilliant too and gave us a free rain poncho as it was raining when we left. Our best night in Hanoi.

Wow! Deserves more than 5*,"Where do you even start? There’s so many to chose from and Peony cruises caught our eye for the decor and style of boat and there full Itinerary & we are so pleased we chose this one.

We booked directly with Peony cruises which included a shuttle from our hotel in Hanoi and back again. The bus picked us up on time and was pure luxury. Only six seats all individually set as big comfy arm chairs with free bottled water. The journey to the port was about two hours from Hanoi with a stop about half way for the facilities/drink/snacks.

The port itself is a little bit chaotic but your soon checked in and given a colour card. Staff then come and collect you based on your card and take you to the tender to get on the boat. Staff take care of your suitcase and ensure it gets to your cruise ship.

As your approach the cruise ship the staff are waiting waving and welcoming you onto the ship. Our host for our 3D 2N cruise was Amy and there was a brief welcome meeting which was funny and informative.

I won’t go into the itinerary as you can find that online but it is a jam packed as it says and all the activities are well thought out and fun.

We stayed in one of the suites and it was beautiful. Separate bath and shower and huge room & balcony. The only very minor issue was it is directly over the engine room so when the boat starts up in the morning (about 615) it’s incredibly noisy but you are on a ship and breakfast starts at 7 anyway.

Nothing is too much of a problem and every evening (apart from during dinner time itself) it’s happy hour. Cocktails where about £6-8 which during happy hour meant you got buy one get one free so only
£3 a go. There was free tea, coffee and water available.

On the second day we we were transferred to a day boat - the food (like the main ship) was phenomenal. My partner doesn’t like prawns and they substituted them with no fuss. Tea & coffee wasn’t included on the day boat which was a little frustrating as it is on our main ship but never the less the staff again were brilliant and it was an enjoyable second day exploring the bay at Cat Ba island.

If you are lucky enough to get some sun whilst on the cruise there are beautiful sun decks on the ship and on the day boat to enjoy.

The bay itself is beautiful. Amy explained that Ha Long bay itself has over 1000 boats docked their during the night. We stayed in Lan Ha Bay (Ha Long Bay was originally the whole area but subsequently split into smaller parts) which only has 30 boats docked of a night so much more peaceful. The water (we even experienced a bit of a storm) was so flat and you did not notice you were on a ship at all when moored or anchored.

Waking up in the bay is an experience you have to include in your Vietnam trip and Peony cruises were brilliant - we have no complaints at all.

Great place & a great way to learn!,"A great memorable day. Learning lots, and trying your own cooking.

There is not much between the full day and half day cooking. I think the full day cos one more dish, for about 300baht extra - so you you as well do the full day!

You are picked up by your driver and chef for the day. Then travel to a local market (not a tourist one!) where the staple Thai ingredients are shown & where the difference between some ingredients is explained.

There is about 15 minutes free time to wander around, and also get soft drinks which aren't available on site! If you want a beer with your lunch, this is when to get it... Even though it feels a tad wrong buying beer at 9am!

From there it is off to the farm, where all the produce grown on site is shown to you. You wander around the farm with your chef, then back to your kitchen.
There are 4 kitchens on site, each able to hold 12 students. We were lucky and only had 6 on our class which felt cosy and personal.

Then it's a nice and slow pace to cook your food,then eat each course. There are 4 courses including dessert - but on the full day course, your main will be 2 courses.

It was a good place, with lots of breaks and time to take everything on board!

You are given a con book at the end with all the recipes from the day plus lots more!

Very well managed - memories made forever,"Full day walk with elephants

Wow! Just wow! Definately an experience to be done!
Just book it! You will not be disappointed! If you want to know more - read on!

The Elephant jungle sanctuary is an ethical enterprise that has rescued the elephants from logging camps and other such places.
The elephants are free to roam in the camp, and are not taught any tricks or such like.
They also employ locals in the villages and help them sustain a better life.

They have 9 camps, so you can end up at any of them. But they are all brilliant.

We were at camp 8 with Pop and Vah as our guides.
They started with an informative explanation of the day, how the elephants came to be there and what to expect of them.

First activity was feeding. It is a great way to get used to these majestic creatures. We were feeding them watermelon by hand which allows you to get up close and personal, get a feel for them and bond with them.

Each elephant has a mahout (elephant trainer/keeper) who are always nearby - especially with the more cheeky young males! But they have such an amazing bond with their elephant it is great to watch.

Once you have bonded with them and feed them about 250kgs of watermelon it is off for a walk/trek through the jungle.

This is a fantastic way of watching how they interact with eachother and seeing them more in their natural habitat. It is a bit uneven and hilly, but it is a jungle! We had a walking group from the UK with us, some of which were in their 80s and one was nearly completely blind - go out is not too strenuous.
You literally walk in amongst the elephants who are so majestic and gentle. It is amazing! After walking for around 45 minutes to 1 hour, it is back to the camp for your lunch.

Lunch is a buffet style lunch of chicken & potato stew, fried vegetables, omelette, rice and fresh fruit. Water, tea & coffee are included. There was a small kiosk to buy soft drinks (coke etc 30baht-75p, beer 60baht-£1.50)
You could also pick up some all carvings and souvenirs, made locally.

After lunch there was a 30 minute break where you could rest/lay down on a raised bed, or just take in the sights.

After this it was time to make some herbal vitamin balls for the elephants, learning what nutrients etc they need to help keep them healthy. Then it is hand feeding the elephants what you have made.

Now it was time for a mud bath. For everyone! You were given time to change into swim wear - wear something dark or something you do not mind getting ruined - free mud can stain some clothing.
Once changed you head down to the mud bath and help the elephants clean themselves using the mud to exfoliate and manage their body temperature. This is an amazing experience. You are in the water with them helping scrub their skin/hide whilst a photographer takes pictures. Again watching the bond between mahout and elephant is truly wonderful!

This activity is done until the elephants have had enough, and start walking off to the river.
When that happens you again head down with them to the river, and help rinse off the mud.
It was an amazing experience, the guides and mahout making it even better!

Again the river party parts as long as the elephants want it to. When they have had enough. That's it. Time to get out.

Then you head up to the camp, wash & and back into your clothes.
We were lucky and they took us home via camp 6, as they had a 3 month old baby elephant (lufas) and we got to meet him.

From there you get your free shirt, and head home!

Great idea - fantastic massage!,"Women’s Massage;

We went here after seeing it in on a few ‘must do’s in Chiang mai’. It is open from 0800 during the week and from 0900 on a weekend. We went for opening on Sunday and were in at 0855 being seen. Even by 0855
we were 7th in...so I am sure it gets very busy.

There are three main options; 1hr Thai body, 1hr foot massage or 2hr Thai Body. We opted for the 1hr Thai body and this was 200baht. You pay at reception and t they hand you a little stick with your preference on it.

You are given Cotton clothes to change into and slippers. they then wash your feet and you go for your massage. The body massages are all in on room on beds next to each other but it is still very peaceful. At the end the women ask you to fill in a little review slip rating your massage.

Our massages were great: the women were lovely and I would definitely go again. Your not allowed to ask why they are there but they are so friendly. There are a couple of guards wandering around but they appear to have a good relationship with the women and makes for a good atmosphere.

There is a little cafe in the grounds: we didn’t have time to try anything but there was quite a big coffee menu to choose from.

Great hotel. Great location,"A lovely boutique hotel right next to the golden temple (Wat Pra Singh)

From the moment you walk in the staff are there with a smile, and plenty of their own cold bottled water.

Check was a breeze, and the room (104) was brilliant.
Clean, fresh, big bed with a decent shower and a seperate roll top bath with a little courtyard beyond. Our only criticism is the room was a little bit dark but I think that's just the nature of the buildings in Chiang Mai. It didn't take away from our stay.

It was my girlfriend's birthday whilst we were there and they even got her a full size cake with candles and brought it to the room singing happy birthday!

The staff were always there to offer hints and tips. They have a Chiang Mai red taxi based at the hotel so it's very convenient if you don't fancy walking. The taxi is 30baht (75p) wherever you want to go, but they stop to pick up other passengers. Kind of like über pool, but it might just take a bit longer getting where you want to go - but sit back and take on the sights! It's all part of the experience!

The hotels location is right in the heart of the old town which is perfect for exploring.
There is a small pool (no where has big pools in Chiang Mai) but as it is the old town you won't get the sun on you on there as its on the middle of the court yard.

Breakfast was mainly cooked fresh for you, with plenty to choose from, good coffee and fruit juices!

Should be top 3 of things to do in Chiang Rai,"Not many places mention this, but this should be in everyone's top 3 along with the Blue Temple & White Temple.

Set on a hillside about 15 minutes from Chiang Rai is Huay Pla Kang Temple
With a huge statue of the goddess of mercy - Guan Yin, although its known as Chiang Rai's Big Buddha (damn those lazy tourists!)

It is quite new in terms of temples, but it is still amazing!

The area is free into the area, which includes a white temple hall and the 9 story Pagoda which you can climb up! No lift though!

But the main attraction is the 90 meter Guan Yin which is how and you can get the lift up to the top. 40baht (£1) but there is no stair option! Those who are not fans of lifts, they are new and very smooth. It is a matter of seconds inside! But it is worth it!

Once at the top of the statue inside is a moral of religious scenes and status all in white, some of which have jewels adorning them. It truly is memorising.
You can also see our through her eyes and third eye, looking out over the landscape. It is beautiful!

There are some food stalls and shops dotted around inside the grounds.

Also there is a free shuttle bus that will take you from the car park to the base of the statue.

Definitely a must when in Chiang Rai!

Rules for all temples :
Dress properly (knees and shoulders should be covered)
Take off your shoes when entering the buildings
Be quiet
Don't hug or kiss
Don't point your feet to Buddha's image

a change up from Thai food,"We came across this restaurant whilst walking into the centre of town. It was quite busy and the interior was really well done and funky.

The menu is quite limited but something for everyone. As per the name the main thing on the list is ribs. You can either have a small portion or large and it comes with two sides. The large portion (as photographed) was 339 baht. Loads of meat and really tender 

There are also a couple of pasta and salad dishes. We also had a pasta and meatballs which was a great size portion and really tasty. 

Service was really quick and the staff where really pleasant.

We hired a moped whilst in Chiang Rai and it was really easy to find and park up. It’s quite a big area with a number of exhibits in different houses around the site. There was plenty to see but a little bit repetitive towards the end.

There are a number of drinks stalls which are again really cheap and whilst you are there you can buy charcoal (black) ice cream to try. There’s a stall near the beginning so if you want to try some grab it there. 

On the way out there is a little market as you enter/exit but nothing massively exciting.  

I wouldn’t go back but glad I did it. Nothing to write home about and wouldn’t of been disappointed if we hadn’t managed it in our itinerary but it was good for the small entry fee.",March 2020,Baan Dam Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g17608469-d2365627-Reviews-Baan_Dam_Museum-Nang_Lae_Chiang_Rai_Chiang_Rai_Province.html,"Nang Lae, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.0
The heart & soul of Chiang Rai,"Little bit tricky to find but we simply searched it on google maps and from there it was very simple. Easiest way in is opposite the pizza company in Phaholyothin Road. Loads of stalls selling touristy bits and pieces really reasonably priced even a view bits we hadn’t seen before. In the centre of the night bazaar was a food court ; loads of things to choose from and all really cheap! You then grab a seat in the centre and there’s either drink stalls or there are staff who will bring you a drink too! A lot of stalls selling Thai Hotpot which the locals seemed to love; we weren’t quite sure how to do it so opted for some noodles and a coconut soup instead. There is entertainment on a stage In the middle of the food court which was nothing to write home about but gives you something to watch whilst eating our food. There was a singer and some Thai dancers when we went.

A must in Chiang Rai,"What everyone comes to Chaing Rai to see and it really is as beautiful as the photos. The whole temple is covered in tiny bits of mirrored glass which in the sun makes it sparkle.

We came on our rented moped and parked up right outside. It was about 3pm (think it generally shuts at 5pm) and it wasn’t too busy and at all and very little tour groups. The entry fee is 100baht which is about £2.50. From here you can take as many photos as you like whilst making your way over to the temple. Inside the temple there are no photos allowed. Some of the temple was shut for restoration whilst we were there so we were directed to the other sites surrounding it ; to name a few there is a waterfall, wishing well, belfry. All very pretty and photogenic.

As all the temples you need to have your knees covered. the shops opposite have stuff for rent for a small fee if you forgot. We spend about 1.5 hours here and enjoyed every minute.

A must see!,"Wow! Simply amazing! A beautiful Temple just over the river from the town centre. About 3 kms from the Clock tower.

An Awe inspiring place from the moment you walk up to the imposing door guard statues (dvarapalas) and into the grounds.
Very tranquil and thought provoking.

There is the main temple with a large white Buddha statue inside. Every wall and ceiling were beautifully decorated with patterns and murals.

It is a Buddhist temple so please be respectful. Cover your shoulders and knees, take your shoes off and leave them outside.
Never sit with your feet pointing towards the altar/Buddha statue.

It is free to enter but I strongly suggest a donation in one of the pots around. It is the lady you can do, for being allowed into such a beautiful Temple!

Do not miss this whilst in Chiang Rai!

30 minutes or so is enough time. There are some stalls selling local products and crafts.

So so cheap! 5* SERVICE FOR 1*PRICES,"Fantastic massage parlour offering foot massage, oil massage and Thai massage to make but a few.

We opted for 2 x Thai massages (when in Rome...)
They were one hour long and up to 3 of you can have your massages together in a private room.
You are given pajamas to put on. Then the treatment starts.

I would say a Thai massage is not for the faint hearted, a cross between deep tissue massage and a chiropractor/osteopath. Massage and manipulations. You may feel a little battered around the edges, but the next morning I felt amazing!

The place was lovely, serving Thai tea after.

The price was unbelievable. For two 1 hour Thai massages was 400thb, I left just over 10% tip so we are talking about £6 including tip!

An amazing little gem!,"What an amazing beautiful place. More of a home stay / B&B. But better than many hotels.

You stay in a small block in the grounds. There is a double en-suite room, a 4 person single beds room (with shared kitchen/bathroom) then a second double en-suite room which also had access to the shared bathrooms and kitchen. Which was the one we were in.

The block is lovely. Everything seems fresh and new. The decor is polished concrete and brick - it looks amazing! The bed was firm (seems to be standard for Thailand) which I prefer, but was still comfortable.

The bathroom was beautiful, with an very decent shower, and bespoke copper sink.

The host was brilliant. Helping with anything and everything.

We asked about a local laundromat, but she offered to do it for 30thb for a load. The clothes came back washed and folded smelling lovely and clean.

On the second morning we wanted to hire a scooter. Again the host was brilliant and we had a scooter delivered to the place within 15 minutes! The price was cheap and the same as other local rentals.

The breakfast was great. Fresh fruit, tea, coffee & juice. You pre order the cooked breakfast - Thai or American with your choice of eggs.
Toast and jam is also there to help yourself.

The host is always available and offers great advice on where to go and what to see.

Great place - go by ferry from the Grand Palace,"Wat Arun

Temple, temple and more temples. It’s what you come to Thailand for & this one is just as beautiful as the rest.

To get there the tourist boat stops outside of there is a little ferry boat (4 baht per person) which shuttles people from one side of the river to the other.

We went later on in the day about 1600 and it was really nice to wander round. There isn’t anywhere to go inside but you can climb onto it and walk all the way round. It didn’t take us very long at all to take some photos and get round it.

We would definitely recommend coming back at night as you can get a cracking views and it’s lit up beautifully. The little restaurants and bars on the opposite side of the river to it are some of the best places to see it from.

It’s definitely one to see but if you are short on time you can see it from the river or from the other side you wouldn’t necessarily be missing out but not stopping and climbing onto it.",February 2020,Temple Of Dawn (Wat Arun),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293916-d317504-Reviews-Temple_Of_Dawn_Wat_Arun-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.5

One of the big 3! A must-see in Bangkok,"The Grand Palace

What a sight to see - would definitely recommend for your Bangkok Itinerary. The dress code everyone mentions is in place including for men. So shoulders and knees to be covered.

We unfortunately slept in after a late night the day after a night flight and so didn’t get to the palace till about midday. We were dreading the queues but we were pleasantly surprised it was busy but nowhere near unbearable and we didn’t have to queue to see anything.

There is a free guide in English at various time throughout the day (definitely at 13:30) by one of the security team. The palace has a nice flow to anyone though and so it’s easy to walk around by yourself. There are also free information.

The stalls around the palace are a tiny bit more expensive than the markets but you’d expect that and it really isn’t by very much - you can still grab cold water for 20 baht!

We arrived by MTS from Central Bangkok. The market is less than 5 minute walk.
Once inside it is massive, you can get a map, but to be honest it doesn't really help.
You are best to just wander around, weaving in and out of the central part into the outside main street around it.

Good good options dotted around, with plenty of drinks etc. everywhere!

A must do if you are in Bangkok at the weekend.

Wear decent shoes, there is some bartering to be done, but some stalls don't! To be honest you are bartering over a few pence or a pound. You can afford it - The stall holders depend on it!

Just look at it for free from outside!,"The biggest draw is the huge fish tank. But you can see it for free in the shopping centre.

We had a dual ticket for the aquarium & at the top. Annoyingly you have to queue twice, once for the Burj and then again for the aquarium even though it’s a joint ticket!!

The aquarium is slap bang in the middle of the shopping centre and the shark tank is amazing. There are so many sharks, swordfish, tuna... it’s really good to sit and watch. However you can see it whilst not paying for the aquarium. We had dinner in the Cheesecake Factory opposite and sat and watched the aquarium for over an hour whilst having our dinner!

Definitely a must when in dubai, but manage your expectations.

Queues everywhere. Firstly you queue to collect your tickets around 10-15 minutes, then you leave to go back at your allotted time, where the queue can be around 30 minutes +
Home people seem to just queue jump or just walk up to the desk in front of you, which is annoying.

We went through security and made our way towards the lifts.
We were then ushered through a fire exit and taken through to some random lifts that serve other parts of the building. After taking 3 lifts to get to the viewing platform, we were again left through a fire exit into the viewing gallery.

We had to fight against the flow of people as we were dropped right next to the exit, so of you were unwitting, you could have missed the open deck and upper deck areas and end up in the queue to get down.

Again the views are amazing and I would do it again, however I was disappointed that we were ushered through staff only areas, as there was info and videos in the lifts as we found out on the way down.

Good hotel - the clubs let it down!,"Lovely hotel - but starting to show its age.

Great hotel 5 minutes walk from Dubai Internet City metro stop.

We arrived at 0930,and the hotel allowed us to leave our bags. We came back and checked in. Everything was ready for us.

We were shown to room 512. Which is one of the suites. This was a lovely upgrade through hotels.com.

The suite was big and spacious. It is a business hotel predominantly, so the rooms cater towards that.

Some of the room was showing its ages (circa 1980s) like a few patches on the bath had mastic to replace the enamel and a few of the light fittings were wobbly and yellowing.

Unfortunately there are a few clubs/bars in the hotel and the bass carries through into the rooms. I called down to reception, the manager rang me back within half an hour offering to move us. The other half was asleep(she can sleep through a riot!) so I took them up on the offer the next morning.
We were moved to room 1512, same again, a lovely suite. This one appeared in slightly better nick, fresher bathroom and light fittings.

Unfortunately even at 15 floors up the bass from the nightclubs travels through the building. Not as bad, but still loud enough to be heard over the TV.

Also along with the nightclub comes the show offs with flash cars, messing around outside. I know this is no fault of the hotels, but as the windows open in the rooms, I think it allows more noise in.

I think they need to invest in better sound proofing around the clubs to help cut out the noise.

It is a lovely hotel and the staff were really helpful, but if you are there on a weekend (Thursday/Friday/Saturday) night, you may get the noise of the clubs.",February 2020,Grand Millennium Dubai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d1149156-Reviews-Grand_Millennium_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,4.5

Lots to see and would definitely recommend bolting it onto your day at the waterpark.

It is busy, we passed out the day before we went with a queue out of the door, so if you are indecisive when you get to the counter the staff will serve the next person - it's not being rude - it's trying to serve everyone quickly!

Great city - can be crowded when the ships come in,"A very beautiful old fortress/walled town nestled at the foot of mountains in Montenegro.

Great to wander round the shops and restaurants, although they are all very touristy.

The downside is that nearly every day throughout the summer session a cruise ship arrives and spills out 100's of not 1000's of tourists who only have 4-5 hours of shore time, so cannot venture any further.

It is steeped in history and some beautiful churches along with other stunning architecture, you will just have to fight through the throngs of tourists unless you get lucky and the cruise ships are boarding or not there.",September 2019,Kotor Old City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295381-d2558862-Reviews-Kotor_Old_City-Kotor_Kotor_Municipality.html,"Kotor, Montenegro",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Wow, stunning scenery",What a beautiful place! Never seen anything like it. Beautiful mountains with a historic old town. We stayed over in Muo so woke up every morning to the bay and cannot beat it. Seeing the cruise ships coming in and out (although make the town very busy) are spectacular with the scenery. Nice driving road all the way round the outside if you have a car and if not beautiful lake side pitches to sun bath on.

Service let's it down,"Great food on the heart of Kotor Old Town.
Lovely view on a pretty little square.
Shame about the service.

We had the mixed meat & cheese board with wedges/fries as a side. The waiter was polite and brought out an amazing looking dish for our lunch.

It had a good choice from the menu, tourist prices, but we were in Kotor old town where they are used to having cruise ships descend on them nearly every day.

The bill I thought was reasonable.

Now the bad part. It was just over €25 and I put €30 down. But the waiter never brought change until we asked.
I will always tip for good service, and even though I'm a Brit, I think I tip more like the Americans. But to decide that I was leaving a 20% tip when to be fair the service was lacking does annoy me.

The waiter wasn't rude but more interested in sitting down on the other side of the square with local shop owners, as we were the only people there. And then slow to get the bill, clear the table and check on us.

I won't be rushing back, but maybe it was an off day for him, but the food was good.",September 2019,Bokun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295381-d10253107-Reviews-Bokun-Kotor_Kotor_Municipality.html,"Kotor, Montenegro",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Great little place with a stunning Vista,"A great little restaurant right on the lakes.

A good little menu with pizza & some local options.
I went in of season so thought they might not take to non locals, but we were made to feel welcome, even through the language barrier.

Food arrived promptly and was very tasty.

And it was very cheap!

One down point, is that the locals/staff still smoke in the non smoking section - but you hmso have to go through the smoking section to get to the non smoking section.
But this is common in many Montenegro restaurants.",September 2019,Sidro kafe bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1728094-d15677770-Reviews-Sidro_kafe_bar-Pluzine_Pluzine_Municipality.html,"Pluzine, Montenegro",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good wholesome food - service isn't the quickest,"A nice traditional restaurant, with a good selection of local and international dishes from the menu.

The waitress was friendly, but didn't soak much English - but thankfully the menu had pictures!

The drinks came quickly and the food arrived fairly quickly and was good. Unfortunately there was only one waitress, which meant that the service was a tad slow for more drinks and dessert.

Beautiful,"Such a gorgeous place!
Wasn't sure what to expect when I booked this as part of a road trip, but I have fallen in love with Mostar.

You must go, the place is amazing, and right at the centre of it all is the bridge that stood for centuries, blown up in the Bosnian war & had been rebuilt beautifully.

If you go during the day in peak season you will see the amazing death-defying kids jumping from the bridge once they get €25.

Wow! Great food! Crazy cheap!,Ate here on recommendation from our host and weren't disappointed. We opted for the meat platter (and from what we could see so did most others).

Wow! Great food - even better price!,"What a find. Simple delicious home cooked food. Absolutely great menu - we wanted to eat it all. We weren't planning too but ended up with a three course meal because the food was that good. Also there is a huge cake fridge so we couldn't miss out on that. If your up at the national park please eat here. People were queuing to get in but when we arrived we were sixth in the queue and it only took 10 minutes so don't be put off.

Great little guest house,What a lovely little find about 5 minutes from the entrance 2 to the national park. Friendly welcome from the host who gave us some juice and some great recommendations for local eats. We stayed in apartment 3 which had a great little balcony. Really clean with everything you could need. Good WiFi and satellite TV. If we came up to the park again we would definately stay here.

If you are OK walking use entrance 2,"So once you get over the 250kuna (in season) per person it is to get in. Advice online I only read on route to park is to book in advance as they only let a certain number of people in at a time but you have to book 2 days in advance so be prepared.

It’s a fab day out. It’s really well signposted and at the beginning you basically pick a route. We opted for route H which did both the upper and lower lakes. We also started from entrance 2 which we found was a little bit quieter.
There are regularly toilets and refreshments around the park which are very reasonably priced. Your ticket also included a bus/train and a boat ride which were both well organised.
I would definitely recommend going and for anyone outside the area to make the trip.
Parking is plentiful and is 10 kuna per hour.",September 2019,Plitvice Lakes National Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303827-d554038-Reviews-Plitvice_Lakes_National_Park-Plitvice_Lakes_National_Park_Central_Croatia.html,"Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia",attractions,5.0,4.5

It’s just outside the main tourist area of Zadar but it has a beautiful little courtyard area outside to eat in. It is next to a road but the restaurant have to well to hide this.

Beautiful - but expensive,"Beautiful afternoon out. We went to the lozovac entrance and its free to park. Just catch the free bus down to the falls. It's a little bit expensive at 200 kuna pp to get in but we spend a good afternoon here and that staff have done a good job at keeping it clean and tidy.

The educational route is 2km long and took us about an hour. The swimming area was a good ending and there was plenty of space for everyone so it didn't feel over crowded - remember your lake shoes tho! We took our own lunch so can't really comment on the food but we had an ice cream which was good.

We had beef cheek (absolutely out of this world!) and the carbonara. Really well priced and would definitely return.

A new experience for me. Pretty much fast food with a steak restaurant atmosphere and feel.
But don't let that put you off... The steak is amazing! Cooked how you like it, with recommendations from the staff taking your order.

Amazing!,"Great campsite for a week surfing & bodyboarding. Campsite is quite small in comparison to others but that just adds to its charm. We had an electric pitch but staff appear more than helpful for phone charging etc if you don’t. Really friendly 24hr staff at location who give great advise on when to surf and local amenities. Also great onsite street food vendor which would rival many top class restaurants. Different themes every night and the breakfast is great - all at really affordable prices.

The bathrooms were spotless and cleaned regularly throughout the day. There is an outside shower for your wetsuits. Our only pointer would be there is no cubicles in the shower area to get changed it once your done (but it’s only a short run back to the tent). Toilets are in a separate block and similarly spotlessly clean and well maintained.

Whilst we were there there was work going on in the sewage treatment works next door which gave off the most horrific smell. Staff came round and spoke to everyone individually assuring us that it was temporary and due to a fault. The smell however did stay there the whole week but that’s not the campsites fault.

Not a spa hotel... When is €19 an hour!,"The hotel itself was clean and pleasant but the included spa (as described) is an additional cost of 19 euros per hour which is a little extortionate in my opinion.

Our room was listed as a suite but wasn’t any bigger than other hotel rooms I have stayed in. There were a few faults with our room which staff seemed uninterested in at checkout. The bathroom door was incredibly noisy and stiff, their was a huge amount of condensation on the ceiling & the electronic blind that kept everything nice and dark was stuck down.

The breakfast was good - organic and local produce but it was served to you rather than you being able to pick what you wanted. The only thing you could choose were how you liked your eggs (the only hot product).

The breakfast was good but nothing too exciting.

When we stayed at the hotel the restaurant was closed for the summer which was a little disappointing. There are a few restaurants in the immediate area (walking distance) but your not spoilt for choice.
