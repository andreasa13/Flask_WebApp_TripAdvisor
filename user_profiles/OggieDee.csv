Good food and service,Went in for a late lunch. Had a home made Steak and Ale Pie with veg and mash. Came very quickly and was well cooked and hot. I also had a white wine and soda.

A hidden gem,I had never heard of Gilbert White so thought I would give it a try. Its a lovely museum that you think is going to be tiny but is actually quite large. Be aware the house is not good for wheelchairs but the gardens are mostly accessible. The grounds are big with signposted (not big signs tho) and would be great for picnics (lots of seating).

In the foot steps of history!,"Loved visiting this as had always been on my bucket list and it didn’t disappoint. They are doing lots of renovation so there is scaffolding everywhere.
Be aware there is quite a lot of walking and in places its steepish.
By the way get the all round €30 ticket and visit the other places too like Agora (in fact especially in Summer go to one of the other sites first as the queue to get ticket will be shorter).

More like a UK 3 star,"This hotel is a bit tired and the room I had needed updating especially the shower area especially the shower head.

It has a 24/7 check in which was great as my flight was late and I got there at 02:30. Member of staff was polite and helpful. Don’t forget you will need to pay €3 per room per night city tax on arrival.

That being said I have to say that room was a good size and very clean. It was serviced every day. If you can choose a room ask for one on the outside of the building as my view was a fire escape...

You can’t access the roof at mo as they are working on 5th floor rooms. Pity about not getting pic of Acropolis at night from there :(

The breakfast was a buffet which was fine as you could have as much as you like. I took tea bags back to my room as two is not enough, even for a solo traveller, if you don’t drink coffee.

I didnt try the hotel dinner buffet as there are plenty of places to eat in Athens.

There is a metro station about 10mins away that takes you to Syntagema Square right at centre which is terminus for all transport.

Would use again but just be aware it’s not usual Best Western posh standard.",January 2020,Candia Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228867-Reviews-Candia_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,3.0
Updated heritage hotel,"An old fashioned beach holiday hotel that’s been sympathetically done up to modern standards. I loved the squeaky floors and stairs tho not everyone will. Nicely off the beaten track if you want that.
Room had all you could need and my second floor corner room tho facing the (not very busy) road was nice and quiet. Didn’t try the food but it is no doubt reasonable hotel standard. There is a small separate bar as well which I didn’t use either.
The view from the other side of the hotel is splendid.
Good car parking tho may need to drop disabled passengers at front door as there is a bit of a slope.
Looks a good place for conferences.",November 2019,Walton Park Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g504119-d211102-Reviews-Walton_Park_Hotel-Clevedon_Somerset_England.html,"Clevedon, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Bargain with a wowcher,"Check in/out very efficient. We booked a 2 night stay with breakfast and dinner for one of nights and it was well worth the money. Requested and got a twin room which was huge as it had a seating area. Good amenities in the room. Bathroom had spa bath (unfortunately didn’t work) with shower over. The shower was a bit of pain as it wasn’t adjustable. Room was quiet as in corner. The room was very clean and seemed modern.
Used the included in deal spa area. Nice clean pool, sauna and steam room. Didn’t use weights or cardio rooms but looked OK. I had a facial which was lovely. Be aware the treatments are separate as the lady is a separate business.
Restaurant food was great. Well cooked, hot and arranged nicely for the dinner. The breakfast buffet was varied and hot. Standard is scrambled eggs but can request poached or fried alternative.

Breakfast was cereals (5/6 different ones), toast, juice and hot drinks as much as you like with facilities to cook up 9.30pm if you like. The daily copy of the Dominion Post was a nice touch.

Cheap overnighter,"Don’t expect 4 star but for the price it was fine. Getting from airport was easy (go out of door six, find the big yellow bus stop and show the driver your booking and it will be free and drops off at the door). The checkin was efficient both key and breakfast voucher were ready. The room, bathroom and bedding was clean (carpet was stained in one place but clean of loose stuff). It needs some of the woodwork replacing. My room had 3 singles in it and there were extra blankets n pillows in cupboard. Enough coffee/tea bags and cups. Bathroom bits were fine and water nice n hot. Only problem was Wi-fi wasn’t working nor was the Sky when I arrived or left. Breakfast was an eat/drink all you like but very bland.

Ideal for Eurostar,"Stayed overnight before catching a Eurostar so it was an ideal location for that. Good value too if you stick to a dorm room. The check in was easy and the staff were very friendly.

The dorm room was full but not overcrowded. It was great being in an en-suite one too rather than having to trog through the corridors. If you have difficulty getting up to top bunk you might prefer to have a single room (or perhaps ask if you can check for a room with a bottom level bunk empty) as the ladders are quite steep. Nice to have not only a plug but also a couple of USB points (well most people have phone+tablet nowadays so makes sense.

The communal areas looked fine though I didnt have time to use them but I was disappointed by the lack of a self catering kitchen even if it had only had a kettle some mugs and tea spoons plus a toaster.

Pity I couldn't take the dog into the outside part of the cafe area because it was inside the no dogs zone else I would have given a five!,August 2017,Nymans Gardens and House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g504221-d2641575-Reviews-Nymans_Gardens_and_House-Haywards_Heath_West_Sussex_England.html,"Haywards Heath, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
A little gem,A friend suggested visiting here and am glad he did. There is memorabilia and stories from the Gelderland. They have a lovely film in Dutch with English subtitles with stories from Dutch folk of some of the crashes. Good car parking and welcoming staff!,August 2017,AVOG Crash Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1087494-d12785962-Reviews-AVOG_Crash_Museum-Lievelde_Gelderland_Province.html,"Lievelde, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,5.0
Lovely place to rest your head,"This was a last minute booking which a friend arranged but we were very happy with.
The house is dated but very comfortable as it is also the owners home. The beds were comfortable and we were given the room with a huge ensuite that would be suitable for disable though not too disable as there is a step down into the shower (there is a separate bath with shower over too. The wifi was a little sensitive but it may have been my phone but it was free... The breakfast was huge and they gave you a little bag etc so you could make a lunch to take away. No parking but you can park on the road for free. Its a fairly busy road during the day but once dark falls its much quieter. Heard nothing during the night. Use of sitting room with big tv (owners have their own). Would use again for 80 euros per couple.",August 2017,Pension Hoes va Neske,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1045094-d6414357-Reviews-Pension_Hoes_va_Neske-Beesel_Limburg_Province.html,"Beesel, The Netherlands",hotels,4.0,3.5
Great overnight stay,"I picked this because it was near to Soesterberg Museum and wasn't too pricy. Got a special deal as I am registered with Accor but even without the discount it would have been cheap.
Its right in the centre of Amersfoort but there is ample parking underneath the hotel. Better directions on how to get there would be good (even on their own website!) It costs 5 euros for parking which is a bargain...
The room was nice and spacious with all the usual requirements plus a little fridge if you are staying for more than a night. We had a room which could be either a double or a twin. Lovely shower with two shower options - rainfall or hand.
Staff were lovely and very helpful including the owner who we met on way out.
The bar area was great and they did a limited menu which is the same as the room service one. Be aware that there is also an all you can eat buffet place on the same floor so be sure to go to the right one. The all you can eat place also has an a la carte. if you want to explore the staff are happy to advise on ideal places.
Only 45mins into Amsterdam from the train station and if flying in you can get to direct to Amerfoort from Schiphol. Trains about every half hour during the day...

All in all a credit to Mercure.",August 2017,Mercure Hotel Amersfoort Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188613-d3799906-Reviews-Mercure_Hotel_Amersfoort_Centre-Amersfoort.html,"Amersfoort, The Netherlands",hotels,4.0,4.0
Huge museum that has a bit of everything,"This great museum is on what used to be the Soesterberg Air Field. The building is huge but there are also activities outside. There is a nice little restaurant that you can visit with out entering the actual museum and even take your meal outside. Many people were having their packed lunches outside. Staff friendly and welcoming.
Will have to go back again because two hours was just not enough. 12.50 euros per adult is not expensive for how long you can stay.",August 2017,National Military Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g652338-d3723948-Reviews-National_Military_Museum-Soest.html,"Soest, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good Off Airport overnight Stay,"This is a good place to stay if you get in late from a flight and don't want to go far or are catching a flight out next day. Its reasonably priced for what it offers.
The free shuttle was great and the driver was very friendly.
The check in was OK but not helped by the poor over night receptionist (we got there about 23:30) being the only one and also being the barman. Might be worth having 2 on till at leave 1am. I would have given a 5 if it hadn't been for that.
The room was ideal and had all we could want for our stay.
The breakfast was great and there was a good variety. Bar prices weren't too bad for a hotel and there were plenty of comfy chairs.",August 2017,Holiday Inn Express Amsterdam-Schiphol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g227906-d1948981-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Amsterdam_Schiphol-Hoofddorp_Haarlemmermeer_North_Holland_Province.html,"Hoofddorp, The Netherlands",hotels,4.0,4.0
Good place to catch up,"Went on the recommendation of friends daughter and was certainly worth the trip into the countryside. Large beer garden at back and for those with kids it has a miniature railway they could ride on. Dogs not allowed in the beer garden but they had 4 tables at front they were allowed in. Good large car park which even though very busy was not full.
Food is very homemade-no frozen scampi here! Generous tasty portions. Service was quick with plenty of friendly, helpful staff on. Good variety of drinks including 2 real ales. Prices were reasonable too.
Toilets were clean and they had a downstairs one for disabled/baby hanging (would have been a five if they had been separate).
If every in Dunstable area would certainly use again..",June 2017,The Fancott,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g499481-d1731153-Reviews-The_Fancott-Toddington_Bedfordshire_England.html,"Toddington, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Relaxed value for military folk,"Have stayed here twice now and will do so. You get top class hotel service for military prices.
I had a comfortable single room on 5th Floor with no ensuite (but they were only a step away and there were plenty of them). You can book rooms with an en-suite if you need one. Everything was clean and the bed was comfy. No aircon but there was a lovely fan. Tea and coffee making facilities plus iron (wish it had had steam) and ironing board) plus 1 large&2 small towels.

The breakfast was a never-ending, varied and well cooked buffet and the staff circulated with fresh tea/coffee. Price was very reasonable.

Staff were very helpful.

Bonus-they have 2 changing rooms but have had to check out or not checked in you can use that. There is a shoe polish machine there and the luggage room is right next to it",June 2017,Victory Services Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1059054-Reviews-Victory_Services_Club-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Lovely place to visit,This is one of the places I went back to Malta to visit and it was well worth it. Took 74 bus from Valletta Centre. Be aware the buses stop early getting back so go in the morning. Plenty of the brightly painted boats doing the trips with 9 people on boat (if you get sea sick easily go on a very flat calm day - not many of those on windy Malta). The trip takes about 30mins. The little caves have stunning blue water. For €7 per adult was worth it.,May 2017,Blue Grotto (Il-Hnejja),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1438795-d313274-Reviews-Blue_Grotto_Il_Hnejja-Zurrieq_Island_of_Malta.html,"Island of Malta, Malta",attractions,5.0,4.0
Lovely meal,"Lovely sitting up high just looking at sun and sea and the little boats going back and forth. Staff very friend. Nice varied menu and when order arrived it was well cooked, tasty and a good quantity. Both food and drink reasonably priced.",May 2017,Congreve Channel Bar & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1182441-d4371323-Reviews-Congreve_Channel_Bar_Restaurant-Qrendi_Island_of_Malta.html,"Island of Malta, Malta",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Cheap n cheerful,Don't expect luxury but the price is cheap for what it is. There is a lift to get you up to the rooms but there are 3 steps into building Si limited for able disabled. We had an apartment with 3 single beds in. Beds comfortable and bedding clean but only one pillow with no extras. The kitchenette was basic but there was a kettle and a little table top oven with 2 ring job. There was also a good full size fridge. Plenty of cutlery and crockery and pans for basic meals (we only did breakfast). They provide a tea towel but no cleaning clothes or washing up liquid so you will need to buy them. There is a little shop with a good variety of supplies about 5 mins walk away plus a newsagent and pharmacy. Plenty of bars and restaurants. Be aware if you are a light sleeper this is not the place for as some of the bars are loud and and finish late. 10 mins walk down to rocky but nice shoreline area. Nice to have a little balcony with table and chairs on it. Bathroom is basic and in the room we had you had to hold the shower but you could have a bath. Plenty of hot water. We didn't need it but there is both fan and zircon. Keys are collected and dropped off from the the Blue Skies St George Hotel just across the road. The Malta Transfer drops off and picks up just outside the St George.,May 2017,Dragonara Court Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g227101-d1178192-Reviews-Dragonara_Court_Hotel-Saint_Julian_s_Island_of_Malta.html,"Island of Malta, Malta",hotels,3.0,2.5

Turkish dramatics,"Wow this is somewhere to go if you want a restaurant with a difference. It's crammed full of stuff with little alcoves and balconies with banquette seating and tables of different styles. The food was secondary but that being said we all had the set meal and the food was good, the wine drinkable (we had the house wine) with friendly polite service. Would happily go again with other friends.",April 2017,Sarastro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d731154-Reviews-Sarastro-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good budget hotel,"It's registered as a 4 star but I would say it's a very good 3 star. Out of Centre with a 10min (for young and healthy) from metro. Quiet street right next to university. Not sure about parking. Steps down to main entrance but the restaurant next door had a slope so for disabled access that's a tick. No step up into hotel either. There are some disabled fitted rooms on ground floor (in fact we had a twin one where the bathroom was same size of the bedroom). Shower had plenty of hot water but not much pressure. Towels and bedding changed each day.
As usual in European places no tea/coffee making in rooms but the bar/reception is open 24/7 if you need a drink. Breakfast was a nice varied eat as much as you like buffet.
Staff friendly and helpful.
Don't forget you will have to pay city tax which is €6 per person per night on top of your room fees.",February 2017,Saint Paul Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d506392-Reviews-Saint_Paul_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,4.0,3.5
