AMAZING to see in person,"amazing to actually see in person!! I am not a history ""buff"" but was a wonderful experience to walk among the ruins rather than viewing a column etc in a museum. The magnitude of what the Greeks were able to accomplish 2500 years ago is unbelievable. We were fortunate to visit Oct 2020 when there were very few visitors:))",October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!,"beautiful hotel and perfect location! we feel so fortunate to have found the Periscope and loved it so much that we extended our stay an extra night, The room was clean, very comfortable bed with great linens, and amazing & attentive staff!
Gogo ( her nickname) - the front desk manager - was very attentive & anticipated our needs before we even asked for it. ( like a ""to go ""coffee for the airport trip prepared exactly the way we had asked for it each morning )
Service like hers has become increasingly difficult to find and we greatly appreciated her service
This hotel is a must stay and we will DEFINITELY stay here again",October 2020,Periscope Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d198991-Reviews-Periscope_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
AUTHENTIC VIEW & TASTE OF ATHENS,"WOW! one of the most authentic markets i have visited! Every type of fish and meat that you can imagine........ along with a beautiful assortment of fresh fruits, nuts& spices in the outside area.
There are a few restaurants inside that get their supplies/ food from the market --- can't get any fresher or ""real"" than that! We ate at Machete (?) which is known for their slow cooked lamb. Delicious- Truly a great experience and a must do in Athens :)",October 2020,Central Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d566808-Reviews-Central_Market-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
"Best hotel on Spetses! hsitoric property, spotlessly clean and beautiful, great location, beautiful property","Loved it the minute we walked into the open lobby area with the beautiful pool, trees tables/seating and soothing music; where the owner offered a delicious breakfast every morning. The owner/manager Christiana addressed our every need with enthusiasm and a smile; her service is on par with a 5-star hotel. Rooms are large and have everything you need for a long stress-free stay. We look forward to visiting again! A must do for any vacationer.
