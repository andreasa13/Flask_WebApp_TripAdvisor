"Well maintained resort hotel, couple, couples or family","We had two adult couples, the two bedroom has a master and a ""lock off with two double beds. There is a full kitchen with accessories (utensils,etc) and in the living area two Murphy beds which we have used when kids were in tow in the past. There is a market that is 10-15% higher than larger grocery stores, a sports bar that we watched the final four games in a crowd of fans and a reasonable rest that has a buffet , with daily themes (Thursday was Prime Rib). Nice pool and beach area and concierge and a TRAVEL COMPANY ON SIGHT. You can stay there the whole time, do some trips or ride the bus back and forth. The staff is friendly and helpful, it is a vacation club destination so you will be invited to a personal presentation, which you can decline.",April 2015,The Royal Sands All Suites Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d153138-Reviews-The_Royal_Sands_All_Suites_Resort_Spa-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
