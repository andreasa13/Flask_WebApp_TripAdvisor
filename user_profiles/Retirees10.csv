Comfortable stay,"Stayed at the Courtyard for one night. The hotel is situated near many eateries and shopping. Easily accessible, plenty of parking. The rooms are clean and well maintained.

"Good lunch, slow service","Stopped for lunch on a Saturday around 13:00 hrs and the place was very busy. The food is fresh and well prepared. However, the service was very slow and we waited over half hour to get our burger and pita. Maybe they needed more help in the kitchen.",October 2019,Cafe Bistro le Mouton Noir,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g182157-d3853022-Reviews-Cafe_Bistro_le_Mouton_Noir-Val_David_Quebec.html,"Val David, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.0
