Soak up the fresh sea air.,"A stroll down the promenade or along the beach at any time of the day and in any weather is one of the simple pleasures of being in Blackpool. I would recommend it as a must do when visiting, start at North Pier and walk as far as Central or further for the full effect.",March 2018,Blackpool Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186332-d8413967-Reviews-Blackpool_Beach-Blackpool_Lancashire_England.html,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
"A must see FREE gallery, full of treasures both Scottish and International",I live in Edinburgh and I often have a walk around this gallery to see if they have anything new. I love art and appreciate this national resource. On every visit I am never disappointed. I learn something new or see something I know in a different light. I would recommend this gallery as a must see when visiting Edinburgh. A note to tourists photography is not allowed.,August 2017,Scottish National Gallery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d219695-Reviews-Scottish_National_Gallery-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
History off the beaten track.,"From the point of view of a local, when a tourist visits Edinburgh they are often awed by the old and new towns and the established sites like Edinburgh Castle and the Palace, however this place like many off the beaten track has as much history and significance as the established central sites for a substantially lower price. This is a film location for the Prison in Outlander. Located an easy bus ride or drive from Edinburgh centre it is worth visiting. I often walk my dogs in the grounds around the castle and enjoy the parkland and fantastic views over the Firth of Forth.",April 2018,Craigmillar Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d213425-Reviews-Craigmillar_Castle-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
"A busy historical high street, worth taking time to get to know.","As a local I have to say I am still amazed every time I walk some part of this street. I take the time to look and see the details in the buildings, statues and many ally's off it known as ""Close"". This area is full of the hussle and bussle of everyday Scottish life where the tourist rubs shoulders with locals, it is an adventure if you take the time to look. Many FREE or low priced admission but certainly interesting venues can be found along this road, along with speciality shops and tourist shops. A word to the wise if you wish to buy whisky as a tourist look do not buy here unless you are sure you could not find what you wanted in a normal shop.",June 2018,Royal Mile,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d188788-Reviews-Royal_Mile-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice park with wildlife trail.,"A public park with a lake which has a boat club using it. Close to Yeadon airport, with the runway only 200m away, good for plane spotters. A trail goes around the lake with good information at points of interest on wild life.",August 2017,Yeadon Tarn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186411-d2534618-Reviews-Yeadon_Tarn-Leeds_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Leeds, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Traditional entertainment.,"Long past it's hay day in the period just before WW2 and the 1980's by which time family holidays were now moving abroad. This Victorian pier still has things that would entertain, if not amuse all ages but especially the under 10 year old's including fair ground rides penny slot machines etc as well as a few things like oldie photo shoots. It is worth a visit to just walk around and sock up the atmosphere for free and buy a few novelties but to make it a main attraction for the day is not advised, and could be expensive for little entertainment. It should be taken with a pinch of nostalgic salt. Recommended for a quick visit with kids.",August 2017,Central Pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186332-d1872026-Reviews-Central_Pier-Blackpool_Lancashire_England.html,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,3.5
Archaeology for the masses.,"A site to be seen on a bucket list in Athens. Worth a visit on a tour to sock up the atmosphere. Sadly it is a ruin due to past use and destruction. No visitor centre, and limited information on the location or site. Good views and plenty of selfie opportunities.",April 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
You get what you pay for.,"My wife and I have eaten here many times and have always had a good meal. The food is basic westernised Cantonese takeaway style food with a mix of basic dishes that British people would find appealing. This place is like many other of its kind, you eat what you want and how much you like for a flat price No frills. Waiters are friendly and plates are cleared quickly, this is not a waiter restaurant the staff are their to fill the buffet, get drinks and clear the dishes. That said, I would recommend it for a cheap meal.",September 2017,Beijing Banquet Danderhall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d2368168-Reviews-Beijing_Banquet_Danderhall-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Walking past so popped in.,"Interesting to see where the Scottish Parliament is based. Worth going to see if your in the area, but nothing to write home about as they say.",October 2017,The Scottish Parliament,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d189691-Reviews-The_Scottish_Parliament-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.0
Fun Bar,"This bar is worth visiting at any time of the day as it has reasonable prices and entertainment, look out for promos.",March 2018,Ma Kelly's North,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186332-d7158908-Reviews-Ma_Kelly_s_North-Blackpool_Lancashire_England.html,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
What a Chippy should be like in a seaside town.,"Every time I visit Blackpool I pop in and see Sam and have my supper from his establishment. I am always remembered and he is a friendly chap to talk to, his fish is always fresh, never seen fish laying around in the display. Very reasonable price and a traditional range of chip shop fare, he also does a very nice curry sauce.",September 2017,Sams Fish and Chips Blackpool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186332-d4941102-Reviews-Sams_Fish_and_Chips_Blackpool-Blackpool_Lancashire_England.html,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Landmark of classic comedy.,"This is now a landmark to be seen and photographed at. Well worth the time to stop and read and chuckle at some classic comedy one liners, young or old can appreciate the talent represented in place.",March 2018,Comedy Carpet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186332-d2336360-Reviews-Comedy_Carpet-Blackpool_Lancashire_England.html,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
