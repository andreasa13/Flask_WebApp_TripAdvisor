The best food ever... seriously,"The best food ever... seriously your body craves each dish. The fish was the best I’ve had anywhere in the world- the venison was amazing also.
Jacob was great with the wines.
What a unforgettable experience!
Thank you xx",February 2020,Lake Road Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186319-d6759704-Reviews-Lake_Road_Kitchen-Ambleside_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Ambleside, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice boutique hotel ideal location pantheon,"Got a big room for us and the 2 kids (on a sofa bed). Quite expensive but very trendy modern room with lovely rainwater shower etc. Staff very pleasant and helpful- small lift to take you up or your cases as rooms start on 1st floor. The 5th floor has a nice open terrace with trendy Kartell bubble sofas etc . Used only at night after being out for dinner for a quick smoke but didn’t have a bar open up there so don’t know whether you take your own drink from your rooms minibar? In the morning I saw a bar like area behind the breakfast buffet- but not sure this was open at 10.30 when we walked past it to get to our room and put kids to bed. Oh and the kids wanted our bed as the tv only pointed to our bed!
Simple buffet breakfast - cereal and fresh melon and scrambled eggs. Some sliced up hotdogs but we gave them a miss as left early for airport.
Cash atm 50m up road at deutchbank and taxi rank too.",September 2018,Terrace Pantheon Relais,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d12445334-Reviews-Terrace_Pantheon_Relais-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.5
Packed and be careful of pick pockets!,Lovely but very very busy and crowded so difficult to get a picture- just take a few and hope for the best or take a selfie pole! Keep your purse or wallet well guarded/ hidden as it is impossible not to be banged into/ pushed in the small crowded area and this is a pick pockets dream!,September 2018,Trevi Fountain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190131-Reviews-Trevi_Fountain-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,3.0,4.5
Go early and avoid crowds,"Lovely place to visit. I bought tickets online but you still had to go to the ticket office to collect the real tickets.
Wear trainers. Lots of uneven steps and slippery marble floor tiles.
It gets very very crowded with trips so go for 8-9am and it is cooler. You can do it in about an hour with younger kids- I printed out some school website type notes on the acropolis and just explained what the buildings were and what they were used for. This was helpful as I showed them a few pictures of what it looked like in the past and this helped them to visualise what it might have been like.
We didn’t use a guide as I wanted to be quick because of the kids but there were a lot of guides and groups there- the written information by each monument is limited so get a guide book if you don’t have a guide.",August 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice little streets with restaurants and shops,"Stayed in the fabulous Home and Poetry boutique hotel just off the edge of these bustling streets with shops and restaurants. Only short visit but there looked like some really good fresh fish restaurants and a multitude of little tavernas where the food looked fantastic.
You are able to walk to the entrance to the acropolis from this area, and there are some lovely little squares and churches nearby to visit.",August 2018,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best pizza slices and aranchini!,"Great little takeaway or eat upstairs like we did. Loads of fantastic pizza that they slice for you and weigh for the price. 4 lots of pizza, 2 aranchini and beer, wine @ sprite for @€16! Full tummy with delicious food and more time to spend seeing the sites! Great pit stop!",September 2018,Barberini Express,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d10837272-Reviews-Barberini_Express-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Proper roman food with great setting,"Walked by all the smaller restaurants off the piazza navone as they are better than those on the tourist square. This was the busiest with locals- a good sign.
We had their special starter of stuffed courgette flowers with cheese and bacon- divine. The pizzas are thin and crispy from a wood fired oven and were sublime - my truffle and bacon pasta was on the special board and you could tell it was homemade pasta.
Puddings- tiramisu panacotta and the kids gobbled up their chocolate semi freddo.
Grappa and limoncello IN PROPER GLASSES!
What an amazing meal. Can’t wait to come back to Rome to come here!
Staff spoke great English and were a good laugh but unpretentious and knew their stuff.",September 2018,Ponte e Parione,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1553916-Reviews-Ponte_e_Parione-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Interesting to see real roman houses,"This is very interesting and is an excavation under the church near the colosseum- not far from the hop on bus. Gives an insight into the size and style of homes, and there are some lovely frescos and a small but very well laid out (& great cooled air conditioned) museum.
The only thing it lacks are maybe some information or paintings to show an artist impression of what it might have looked like in the past with some people doing their everyday stuff. I am a historian so found the info ok but it was definitely of limited use to my kids and husband who I had to try and explain what it might have been like in the past.",September 2018,Case Romane del Celio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d2536596-Reviews-Case_Romane_del_Celio-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
Fantastic boutique hotel,Stayed one night in the two bedroom Elytis suite. Beautiful room. Went to the Acropolis early and then back to hotel for lovely breakfast. The terrace bar has a great view of the Acropolis- especially at night when it is lit up. Location to the old town shops and tavernas is great. Already planning a return long weekend with husband to stay here again! Oh and the lady that does the late bar and the breakfasts (superb Greek omelet with feta cheese) is so lovely and friendly.,August 2018,Home and Poetry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d12389149-Reviews-Home_and_Poetry-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great family room,"Went for 3 nights -extra bed in room for 2 adults and 2 kids. Room clean and good ensuite shower. Fresh towels each day and tea/coffee. Bed linen really clean and fresh. There was a powerful fan in the room as there wasn’t air conditioning and it was hot at night but then it has been a hot summer.
Great location for gun wharf quays- only ten minute walk.
Car parking pass for street parking.
Very good value- would definitely recommend and will be staying again in future. Thank you.",July 2018,Duke Of Buckingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186298-d1154525-Reviews-Duke_Of_Buckingham-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
Lovely food and service,"Read reviews and popped in for a late lunch after walking fells with family. My husband and I had the venison burger- it was 5* - fantastic!
The boys shared a fish finger sandwich and had our chips. They gobbled up their rocky road cakes and we shared a chocolate & beetroot which was unbelievable!
The lady that served us was really lovely- you could tell she was proud to work there and her delight shone through.",November 2017,Copper Pot Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186319-d10104174-Reviews-Copper_Pot_Cafe-Ambleside_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Ambleside, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Very nice,Had clams to start and lobster. 2nd meal this week with husband. Lots of family pride in this place- they work hard and it shows. Lovely people and freshly prepared food.

Always good,"Been coming to this restaurant for a while- always great food and service. Staff very professional and have lovely manners. Organised and well run - great atmosphere too. Tried pasta and pizza- all good - but the fish and chicken dishes are really good too.
Always finish with an expresso martini (or2) and hot chocolates for the kids. Win win.

Fantastic meal yet again,"With two young boys and couldn't be made to feel more welcome. Adult food but chef will do lovely spring rolls, chicken skewers with noodles and chips which kids gobble down. The adults had vapeurs ,beef wok & Japanese duck. All fantastic. We come here every time we are in Nice and love it!

Fantastic,Eat here very regularly - food is very good. Try seafood Friday - had probably the best Dover sole anywhere. Service is attentive and informative from friendly staff who definitely enjoy their jobs and are good with customers. Chef very talented and has a lot of top class experience.,December 2014,The Lamplighter Dining Rooms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186330-d817725-Reviews-The_Lamplighter_Dining_Rooms-Windermere_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Windermere, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent fresh ingredients,"Been to this place many times and the food is lovely - especially the king prawns which are properly sized and cooked. The chicken is in tender chunks, and you can tell they use fresh ingredients and don't just smother unidentifiable things in sauce! The staff are always very pleasant and gracious, both to early family diners and the late night night après beer crowd.",December 2014,Mela Spice Fusion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190820-d1630514-Reviews-Mela_Spice_Fusion-Bowness_on_Windermere_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Bowness-on-Windermere, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
