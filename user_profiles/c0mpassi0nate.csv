Inappropriate choose your spot carefully,We have been going here for many years and until now enjoyed. While relaxing at the beach bar resident surf instructor had his dog in the restaurant and he encouraged it to pee on the base of the umbrellas within steps of people eating and drinking. So caution if you aren’t wearing shoes while sitting at the beach tables you never know what you will find. I travel a lot and know caution should be used all the times but in this case it could be controlled in a more respectful manner.,February 2019,Oasis Ocean Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150791-d1367902-Reviews-Oasis_Ocean_Club-Manzanillo_Pacific_Coast.html,"Manzanillo, Mexico",restaurants,2.0,4.5

Not good service,Unfortunately the server was complaining about being busy with only 2 staff in and having to get food from the kitchen located on the other side of security. Blamed the kitchen for mix ups with other customers eggs ( not kitchen fault plates were served correctly by servers) and my plate had egg shells. Not cool when most of the customers flights were delayed and that's while we were here. Server tried to send others to Tim hortons. Lol there are lots of open tables not that busy.
