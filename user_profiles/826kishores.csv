Interesting but expensive for the worth,"It is very interestingly designed. But it does not give any information about the places one visits such as French settlement, Chinese settlements etc. This is the minimum one expects when they title urban tales. The scripted and choreographed tale is not the real urban tale- it needs explanation about the places one visits. Although it is very interesting concept and keeps you engaged, it is very expensive for its worth.",December 2019,Urban Tales Phnom Penh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293940-d15555243-Reviews-Urban_Tales_Phnom_Penh-Phnom_Penh.html,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",attractions,3.0,5.0
Third grade restaurant in a beautiful location,"It is a terrible place for Bangladeshi thai food. Never again. It is so confusing that we wanted to go to Kiyoshi, which is a floor above, but we landed up in this place. Every item that we ordered- coconut based sea food soup (sweet like hell), papaya salad (worse in town) and the main dish- all were terrible. It is chaotic, noisy and party place.",July 2019,Thai Emerald,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293936-d3731084-Reviews-Thai_Emerald-Dhaka_City_Dhaka_Division.html,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Ideal place to be away from the polluted and crowded Delhi,"I can not add much to what has already been written about this place. It is my most favourite place if I ever plan to be in foothills. Big room, humongous lawn, most beautiful family with full of energy and love and the food is too good to talk. Whatever I write will be inadequate to describe the magic of this place and people who own this propoerty.",December 2018,Foothills Himalaya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1152784-d2426932-Reviews-Foothills_Himalaya-Jim_Corbett_National_Park_Nainital_District_Uttarakhand.html,"Jim Corbett National Park, India",hotels,5.0,5.0
Decent accommodation a bit away from central London,Nice room and helpful staff. There are many places to eat around this hotel and if you are interested in the Royal Dockyard then it is a good place. It is very close to the Metro station and you will in central part of London in 20 to 30 minutes.,February 2019,Crowne Plaza London Docklands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d279655-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_London_Docklands-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Intrinsic of Greek history,"Despite ravages of times and many attempts of destruction, it stands as a witness of glorious past of Greece. Put good pairs of shoes and carry water and hat in summer. It is not disability and old persons friendly place.",August 2018,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Must visit,"It embodies history of 3,500 years. It is a must visit place, preferably with guide.

Must see,This is an area that takes you to medieval Europe and makes you imagine the life then.

Must do this,It is one of the best things we did in Greece. This is a must walk for getting perspective of the historical Athens.

Average place and badly managed,"This was our third visit and the worse one. Out of everything we ordered only labra was of the same quality that we had last two times. Morton boot dal had a tough mutton and we had to return it, there were six pieces of pickles and two smallest pieces of chicken in super sour chicken achari, bhorta was very average- any Bengali family will make that better, ilish fish had more eggs than flesh.. I can go on. Finally, when we complained they packed a chicken recipe which leaked and spoiled the clothes. Never again!",August 2018,Paturi Bangladesh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293936-d12993866-Reviews-Paturi_Bangladesh-Dhaka_City_Dhaka_Division.html,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Deterioration has reached to the lowest,"In two words- Never Go, is the most appropriate reaction of mine after spoiling my evening today. I had gone there after couple of years, and they had shifted from road 71 without changing their address at their website on on googles. The same shoddiness and laziness was evident in their food. Except their coconut milk based soup everything that we asked was terrible- phad Thai, their special chicken and prawn salad - it was all fried with sauce ( only brainless chef can call it salad) and green roll. You will consume 100 times more sodium if your bites even get a feather touch to their fish sauce. It is Deshi Thai for the ones who have romantic imagination of a Thai food.
NEVER GO TO THESE UNPROFESIIONALS.",December 2017,Soi 71,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293936-d1878478-Reviews-Soi_71-Dhaka_City_Dhaka_Division.html,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Quiet and serene place,"It is a bit secluded and peaceful island with beautiful colours of sea and mountains. The island hoppers, however, keep making crowds to disturb the peace efficiently. There is not much infrastructure and not much to eat.",June 2017,Poda Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1507054-d4322759-Reviews-Poda_Island-Ao_Nang_Krabi_Town_Krabi_Province.html,"Ao Nang, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing campus and fabulous services,"It is one of the best resorts as have stayed in Thailand. It has very nice room, amazing services, very green campus, beutiful campus, pool with awesome view and reasonably good food. Some of the staffs are bit cold and shuttle services could be more frequent and flexible. There is just one staff giving room services and driving the shuttle. Overall, we enjoyed the place very much and will recommend people to visit this place.",June 2017,Ban Sainai Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1507054-d4061895-Reviews-Ban_Sainai_Resort-Ao_Nang_Krabi_Town_Krabi_Province.html,"Ao Nang, Thailand",hotels,4.0,5.0

Terrible Indian food,"Those who may have not tasted authentic Indian food may find it good as many reviews here suggest. To us, it was terrible. The Kabab was terribly bad and Thai food was below average. Not, sure why has it such reviews. To us, the reviews are very misleading.",June 2017,Bawarchi Delight,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1507054-d10595107-Reviews-Bawarchi_Delight-Ao_Nang_Krabi_Town_Krabi_Province.html,"Ao Nang, Thailand",restaurants,2.0,4.5
"Fabulous food, terribly bad service and its management","Never visit on weekends, especially if you are not with a big family or bunch of friends. They don't care. You never find the manager their on weekends when it is most crowded. I am saying it after visiting them for more than two dozens times. Food is fabulous as everyone has written here but service and management is terribly bad. Staffs are sweet but unable to meet the demands of crowd for the lack of management. The manager is truly dumb and the staffs suggest you to complaint against the management on social media as they don't listen to them. I had terrible experience in my last three visits. It seems the owner is drunk with its earning. Thanks to the cook.",May 2017,Lucknow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293936-d9603154-Reviews-Lucknow-Dhaka_City_Dhaka_Division.html,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",restaurants,4.0,4.5
