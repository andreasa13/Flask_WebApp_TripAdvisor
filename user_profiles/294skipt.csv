Perfect Getaway!,"Spent a week here last summer. It was relaxing, hospitality was top notch, and the food was great!

Move up to business class if you're over 5 feet tall!,"Great service, courteous staff, good food even but the seats were way to tight and very uncomfortable. Had to stand for much of the 10+ hour flight because with the seat back reclined in front of me I couldn't fit my knees in behind the seat.

A must see in Athens! Pre-buy your tickets though.,It was an amazing sight! Standing on thousands of years of history. The only draw back was waiting in line for 1-1/2 hours to get an admission ticket. Seems the woman in the ticket booth was more interested in her cigarettes than selling passes to the sight. The booth was struck by lightning the next day so I better not say anything else....:),April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great place for a modern spin on traditional Greek fare.,"What can I say? Excellent food and service. Located upstairs in what seemed like an old family home, the atmosphere was welcoming.

You Be Pleasantly Surprised :),Coming to find shelter and a drink from a hailstorm while visiting the Acropolis. We were welcomed with big smiles and great service. We decided to order some apps with our drinks and WOW what good food. They even gave us a complimentary dessert.
