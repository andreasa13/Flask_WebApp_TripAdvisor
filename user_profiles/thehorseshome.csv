Three in one,"We have visited the garden centre several times, mainly for the plants which always look healthy and well cared for - I believe quite a proportion are grown on site. The bedding plants are particularly good and everything is reasonably priced. Limited hard goods are also on sale. Always tidy with good service. There is also a farm shop on site which sells super vegetables as well as other food such as bread, preserves, pickles etc with a separate butchery section. Also fresh flowers.
Situated between the garden centre and farm shop is a cafe with an entrance from each. Perhaps because of the position it looks a little dark and not very welcoming however there is plenty of seating with some comfortable sofas and chairs.Also a small covered outside area which looked scruffy. We just wanted a hot drink with a cake opting for toasted teacake ( large ) and fruit bread ( packed with fruit ) . Service was friendly and efficient. Had toddler with us who was catered for.",March 2020,Hodgehill - Farm Shop & Garden Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g528783-d10455707-Reviews-Hodgehill_Farm_Shop_Garden_Centre-Kidderminster_Worcestershire_England.html,"Kidderminster, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Breakfast,"The pub has had a facelift since we had last visited ( moved out of the area ) and we were pleasantly surprised. Good carpark and exterior looks much more inviting. Inside cosy rooms with traditional look. We were there for a booked breakfast for our group . Warm welcome from the staff who were very helpful. The full English breakfast was excellent with the plate fully stacked with well cooked food , Served with tea and coffee, all for 10 pounds.

A little gem,"We have been a few times to the Cock, off the beaten path but worth the effort. It is a comfy old fashioned slightly shabby pub with separate rooms and welcoming open fire in the bar - don't go if you like slick re furbished pubs. There is an attached cafe and shop which is open during the day. The menu is varied and there is always a good selection of 'specials '. All home cooked food so don't expect swift service. The pies are particularly good. Prices are very reasonable. We have also been for lunch, the ploughmans are huge. Real ales served. Service is good.",November 2019,The Fighting Cocks Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g4222610-d2148731-Reviews-The_Fighting_Cocks_Inn-Stottesdon_Shropshire_England.html,"Stottesdon, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Party of 10,"A country pub which has been re furbished in appropriate style with conservatory type extension. I remember it previous to this and find the improvements have been done sympathetically and retained the character of the pub.Attractive outdoor seating area for warmer weather.Booked a meal here for 10 including a baby some weeks before the event. Welcomed and seated straight away with baby chair supplied. The menu is well balanced with all the meats and fish represented , all with appropriate accompaniments. Price slightly above average but the food looks to be home cooked and prepared fresh. We had a cross section of dishes and all were enjoyed as full of flavor and hot.. Service by efficient and enthusiastic young people and atmosphere is good.

Enjoyed the meal,"Our first visit to the Haughmond as we live some distance away but will make the effort again. The restaurant was pleasantly decorated in country style, it seems there are one or two small rooms as well. Nice atmosphere as the place was full, mostly local repeating customers I should imagine. We had to wait a little while for the table, unfortunately not much room in which to wait and we felt in the way. The menu was imaginative and well thought out although we did have to clarify a few points before ordering as not always clear. Not a large selection but understand that the food is freshly prepared so difficult to have an expansive choice. Service was a little slow, again we are tolerant of this giving the nature of the establishment but we were decided chilly which is not really acceptable. We all enjoyed our meals, the main courses were a little on the small side so we also opted for desserts and cheese which we rarely do. Prices are good for the quality of the food. All in all an enjoyable evening.",November 2019,The Haughmond,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6756078-d6539641-Reviews-The_Haughmond-Upton_Magna_Shrewsbury_Shropshire_England.html,"Upton Magna, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Large pub,"The pub has several rooms, all decorated in traditional style with plenty of wood in the old part. We were here in lovely weather so opted to sit out in the garden which has some interesting features and is very pleasant. Also children in the group. We ordered at the bar, not sure if this also applies for dinner but hopefully not ! We decided on some sharing dishes including a pizza as we only wanted light nibbles. It was a bit of a wait but the place was busy being good weather and a weekend. The dishes were interesting and tasty but on the small side for the price. The menu looked interesting and imaginative although the steaks were on the expensive side so can't drag my husband back to try the dinner menu. The children menu looked good .",July 2019,The Manor House of Whittington,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1135311-d8773520-Reviews-The_Manor_House_of_Whittington-Kinver_Kinver_Parish_Staffordshire_England.html,"Kinver, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Excellent nursery,"Having recently moved to the area we have only just found Ashwood Nurseries although I am pretty sure I have seen them at gardening shows. Was impressed with the general layout and tidiness - no shrubs lay about diseased and lacking water here. Everything was labelled which is a feat in itself and displayed on immaculate outdoor beds and greenhouses. Reasonable range, prices are not the cheapest but sometimes it is better to get good stock than compromise. Also display garden which again was well looked after. Not the biggest selection of hard stock but adequate with a small gift shop. Restaurant very good with home cooked food. Looking forward to seeing John's garden which is open various times over the year.",February 2020,Ashwood Nurseries and John's Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3448302-d8134119-Reviews-Ashwood_Nurseries_and_John_s_Garden-Kingswinford_West_Midlands_England.html,"Kingswinford, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good home cooked food,"The garden centre is well presented and kept immaculate. Mostly a plant nursery the plants are all in excellent health and well displayed in tidy beds and greenhouses. Hard stock is limited but sufficient. The cafe is normally busy when we go so entails a wait to choose food and pay. The food always looks very enticing which makes it difficult making a choice ! We normally go in the afternoon so have a cake and hot drink. Everything looks home cooked and the different flavored scones are particularly good. Prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food. The restaurant is a little dated but comfortable and overlooks the display gardens, there is also an outdoor seating area .

Iconic Skyline,"One of the most iconic skylines in the world, especially with the new buildings on Grand Zero, although there are many worldwide jostling to overtake it. It can only be appreciated fully from the river so take the Staten Island ferry and stay on it for the return journey or you can travel over to New Jersey.

Great Foodie Experience,"We always have a wander through the market when in New York, it is convenient for the High Line and the riverside attractions also. Some trendy shops selling interior decorations and clothing but the main attraction is the foodie shops and cafes. The specialist shops and bakeries sell best quality goods and are a delight to experience - particularly I like the fish hall.

Cosy old fashioned pub,"Cosy pub made up of several small rooms with traditional decor. Large car park on the side with attractive small outside seating area, it is roadside but the traffic does not detract. After trying the food a couple of times we tend to stick to drinks and a packet of crisps. Real ale pub and I like the small bottles of Prosecco they serve.

Great atmosphere,"First visit for us, a party of 6 we all liked the feel and atmosphere of the pub and nice to have a friendly greeting. There seemed several small rooms decorated in country style - we all felt the lighting was a little too bright where we were sat. The service could not have been better or more efficient, friendly and caring without being obtrusive. Unfortunately for me the food just missed the mark. We had a sharing platter which was a little uninspiring although the home made pate was delicious. I had beef burger with stilton and mushroom, the burger was home made but very over cooked so a rather solid lump - I didn't think to ask if they cook them more rare which some places do. Also the cheese was soaked into the bread rather than dripping over the burger and I rarely eat the bread. Plenty of chips with chunky cabbage in mayonnaise . Others had steak and gammon , big platefuls and steaks were cooked correctly but pretty sure they were previously frozen. Shame nearly there with a little more thought. Prices were very good if the food was tip top",February 2020,The Swan @ Blakedown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g528783-d2331048-Reviews-The_Swan_Blakedown-Kidderminster_Worcestershire_England.html,"Kidderminster, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5

First visit since takeover,"The centre was not stocked as well as previously but put this down to the new owners putting their own stamp on the place and getting rid of dead stock. Plants looked good and definitely cheaper than Wyevale. Good half price offers on garden pots. General stock quite low but renovations still going on in the main shopping area.
Had a snack in the cafe - scone and tea - which was fine. The menu looks much extended and prices seemed reasonable. The ladies do need to quicken up on the till as a large queue developed .We took our grandchildren to the soft play area which was very busy being half term. Good value if not so crowded but lots of children were too much for our 2 year old.

First time,"Our friends have just moved to this area so we decided to give the Red Lion a try. First impressions are an attractive building which has been modernised. A winters evening it was warm and looked welcoming despite the opened out look and rather standardised seating.We passed on starters which looked quite interesting. Not sure why but found it hard to find something I fancied on the menu as did the other 7 who mostly ended up with steaks. I had the pork which was fine although on the cool side. The rump steaks were not too good and fillet did not have much flavor. Three had sweets and it worked out at 80 pound per couple with wine and drinks which I consider on the pricey side. Service was fine, friendly and efficient.",February 2020,The Red Lion at Bradley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186377-d2066792-Reviews-The_Red_Lion_at_Bradley-Stafford_Staffordshire_England.html,"Stafford, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Interesting shopping area,"Bustling area filled with locals and tourists. The centre square is a little scruffy and you probably need to keep a close eye on your wallet. The flea market entrance is off this square which is a busy area filled with shops selling all manner of items. Also close by are several Roman sites - Ancient Agora, Roman Agora, Hadrian's Library - connected by a row of busy restaurants running down the metro line. Bustling atmosphere with buskers. The far end of the market has an area of antique dealers selling all manner of items. Leads onto Psyrri area which again is an interesting place with plenty of eateries and specialist shops.

Great little place for drinks and eats,"Just opposite our hotel this small cafe / bar / bistro is also owned by the same family. It is open all day serving food throughout. Modern take on the interior with outside eating area. We stopped for an early evening drink and enjoyed the atmosphere and wine so called back for something to eat the following evening.
The menu is designed mostly for sharing in a tapas style so you can order two or three of the dishes. We tried the 'scallops' which we assumed were the shellfish but were actually little mounds with a sliver of scallop on top in a bright green sauce - not sure of the flavors but very delicious. The second dish were meatballs which again were very flavorsome in a tomato sauce topped with blue cheese. Third dish was salt fish and chips which were small piece of salt cod surrounded by strings of crispy potatoes, again absolutely smack on for flavor. Not sure why the servings are in 5's when it is a sharing dish. Very busy when we were there but service was quick, friendly and very professional. Good atmosphere with music in the background.

Can be seen from the boundary,"Excavated Roman site with Hadrians library at the far end, foundations and some standing columns. Interesting but not worth paying full price as you can see it all from the fence above the site. Signage a little better on this site than others but information could be found in a guide book.

Easy system but usually crowded,"Did a bit of research before traveling and found you have to purchase a separate 10 euro ( one way ) ticket to travel from airport to city, also being over 65 we were half price so only paid 5 euros each. Terminal is on upper level of arrivals or you can get a lift outside the ground level exit doors. Booking office is very helpful and all speak excellent English - you need to go to the booking office . Easy to use with four main tracks. Journey is about 45 mins to city centre, we had just one change.The stations are very clean and airy and not too crowded unless a train has just arrived. Carriages are normally full. As with all underground we were warned by hotel to keep a close guard on wallets etc.
We also purchase the Ath.ena ticket which is 9 euros for 5 days and you can use it on underground, buses and trams so excellent value - no discount for pensioners.

Plenty of steps,"We walked from our hotel and climbed the flights of steps to the funicular. There we were approached by taxi drivers who said that they would take us to top fo 8 euros as the funicular would have been double that we took advantage. The drive took us around the other side of the hill and we were dropped at some steps which was quite a climb. On deciding to walk down we discovered we had hardly saved any walking distance by taking taxi so if you are relatively active it is quite easy to do complete climb - we are pensioners. Well worth the effort as the 360 degree panoramic view it incredible. Well designed cafe set into the top along with a small Orthodox Church.

Stunning,Our hotel was very handy for this visit so we just had an uphill stroll to the entrance. We purchased a combined ticket for 7 sites which cost 30 euros each - a great saving on summer prices but check if they are reduced for the winter season as a couple of the places do not need close inspection. We were approached by tour guide who wanted 100 euros for an hours talk a thought she did come down in price - feasible for a group but not just two of us. Wear non slip shoes and there are quite deep steps to the entrance although I think there is a lift. Stunning views and the Pantheon still gives a sense of awe. On reflection we wished we had visited the museum first as they show two interesting films which give background information. Information boards around the site and interesting to see the restoration.

Also great views of the Parthenon and an interesting small museum full of pottery and other finds. In the flea market area which is a great place to wander with shops and antique dealers along with some great eating places a little further on rather than the busy restaurants which line the metro line .

February visit,"Good time of year to visit I can’t imagine what it is like in the heat of the summer. We bought a combined 30 Euro ticket which gives you entrance to other monuments , it would save a lot in the summer but prices are cheaper in the winter so I wouldn’t bother as some of the sites can be viewed from outside. Also prices are cheaper for concessions. Need non slippy shoes as it can be bare marble and rock. We were offered guided tour for 100 euros for an hour which was ridiculous for two of us, she did keep coming down but unless there are a few of you it is not worth it. Plenty of information boards and the view is terrific.

Being February it was not too busy and we soon were served with glasses of water and a complimentary Turkish Delight. Big selection of cakes and desserts with optional ice cream for around 7 or 8 euros. I had the traditional filo pastry which was soaked in syrup and chocolate sauce whilst hubby had chocolate cake again drenched with chocolate sauce. The servings were immense and really sharing one between is the way to go as I could not eat half of mine. Not sure of the flavour of the ice cream which was not vanilla, perhaps something traditional. Well worth a stop if you have a sweet tooth.

Pleasant,"We went for dinner as reviews were good and it was just around corner from our hotel. Generally we steer well clear of restaurants around tourist attractions but several had good reviews. Pleasant place to sit with outdoor heaters, looked clean. Service friendly and attentive and we were offered a free drink on choosing this restaurant. Had spinach pie and anchovies to start. The pie was very tasty but filo pastry was soft and not crispy. Anchovies were excellent served with some kind of breadcrumb. Main was prawns with tomato and cheese sauce on rice, absolutely loved the flavours and would recommend. Hubby had lamb which was very tender but lacking in flavour although it was served with thyme which helped. Shared walnut cake which was drenched in syrup and served wiyh ice cream.

Set out chronologically and each room numbered so the route is clear. The early exhibits are of great quality and we were knocked out by the jewellery. Everything is immaculate and the house is pristine. Fantastic reconstruction of three rooms and lots of costumes. We were there 3 hours although you could spend more time if brain can take it. The restaurant is also well worth a visit.,February 2020,Benaki Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198714-Reviews-Benaki_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fabulous,"The museum is absolutely stunning and exhibits are beautifully displayed. The museum is built to accommodate the footprint of the Pantheon so is large and airy. All exhibits were found on the Acropolis site or removed from the Pantheon for conservation. The top floor exhibit is particularly jaw dropping. Restaurant is good and not too pricey. Allow time to watch both films, one on conservation project and another on the history. Would recommend going here before visiting Pantheon as it puts it in perspective",February 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5
Happy hour,Pulled in by happy hour prices of 1.70 for largish beer. Just had a wine anf beer and decided to order a dish of whitebait which were freshly cooked and delicious. Also ordered bread which brought the total to 15 euros so very reasonable. Can't comment on meals but food did look good. Typical touristy place with good service.

Good start to journey,"Arrived around 10am and breakfast items were on self service buffet. Bacon rolls, baked beans, omelette etc along with a good selection of fruits, cereals and juices. Too early for me to take advantage of alcohol. Self service hot drinks with biscuits also good. Busy but plenty of comfy seats and good facilities if you need to work. Seating has good view of runway at one end.

New visitor,"Hadn't been here before and was surprised ny the size of the garden centre. In between seasons so empty spaces waiting for new stock. Not a huge plant area but plenty for all the family inside. The cafe was large and barn like but clean and tidy
with everything looking spick and span. Two sofa seating areas with magazi es which is a nice touch Had bacon sandwich with coffee for £6.20. Bread fresh although off a boring sliced loaf and bacon tasty. Cream available for coffee. Service by young people who were charming. Roast and dish of day served, also breakfast with sandwiches so menu is fairly restricted.",February 2020,The Greenhouse Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2518533-d15228175-Reviews-The_Greenhouse_Kitchen-Codsall_Staffordshire_England.html,"Codsall, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Rainy Monday,"This cafe has been here for years so must be a testament to its popularity. Having moved from the area we have not been for some years but it still looks the same. We called in at lunchtime and were relieved to find it quiet as space is very limited. Rustic pine tables and benches with an upstairs seating area as well. Just wanted a drink and snack so choose a cheese scone and coffee, also shortbread and tea. A little confusing as to system of ordering and felt in the way as I was served because they were also bringing hot food from the kitchen - not sure how this works when they are busy. The scone was delicious and fresh, actually having a sharp taste of cheese which so many cannot achieve. Coffee OK and they had cream for serving. Tea good value as hubby got two cups from the teapot. Scone was very reasonable at 2 pounds but was confused to read that scone with butter and jam was 3 pound so not sure if I had paid extra for butter. Everything home made and the salads looked very tempting. Main dishes were 10 pounds with 2 salads, not sure how these went with the cooked food. Not the largest portions. Quirky loo which was clean.",December 2019,The Olive Branch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186367-d1213014-Reviews-The_Olive_Branch-Ludlow_Shropshire_England.html,"Ludlow, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Suitable for Quick Refreshment,Its Ok for a quick refreshment between shopping but personally would not waste money on most of the food available. It seems good value but the food quality and quantity are cheap. Sooner save my money for a decent meal elsewhere without queuing Restaurant is clean.,December 2019,Ikea Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2394967-d15068632-Reviews-Ikea_Restaurant-Wednesbury_Sandwell_West_Midlands_England.html,"Wednesbury, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Large barn like cafe,Its Ok for quick refreshment between shops otherwise don't bother. Prices have gone up and don't represent value for money for the quality of the food. Large coffee although reasonable price is only cup size although you do get a pot of tea which is good value. Cakes are over priced for quality. Usually busy as they have a captive audience the area is pretty basic and uninspiring. Clean although I always think shiny pine tables are not the best as they get sticky. On another note we were disappointed with Boundary Mills which seems to have lost the quality shops and most garments looked as if they had been well looked through - although this may be because it is end of the sale season.,January 2020,"BB's Coffee Shop, Boundary Mill Walsall",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187059-d7708312-Reviews-BB_s_Coffee_Shop_Boundary_Mill_Walsall-Walsall_West_Midlands_England.html,"Walsall, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,3.0
Adjoined to the Antique Centre,"Small cafe with an interesting menu that showed some imagination. Nicely presented and decorated. Had a cheese and onion toastie which was OK. Coffee was good.

Quick pit stop,"Broke our journey here for a quick refresher, remembering it from some years ago. Has massively expanded and glad to see the Antique Centre was still there. Quite confusing to navigate, didn't look around extensively due to shortage of time. Cafe looked as it it could do with a refurb, made for the soft sofas but they were absolutely filthy and I couldn't bring myself to sit there. Had a scone which was freshly baked and a sandwich which was OK.

Usual range of shops,Average shopping centre with usual range of shops including a large Asda under the same roof. Most of the chain shops are on the small side apart from the extensive new Next and Marks and Spencer. Primark has recently increased in size as well.

Father Christmas Grotto,"Took our granddaughter to see Father Christmas here, booked online to make sure of a place. The garden centre itself had a lovely display of Xmas decorations and lighting which we enjoyed browsing. The Santa experience was great, firstly met by Elves who guided us to mix reindeer food and paint a Xmas decoration. We then wandered through fabulous moving animal and snow scenes to meet Father Christmas. Afterwards she could choose a worthwhile gift from a great selection. Well worth the 10 pound charge ( plus 2.50 for accompanying adult ) , my granddaughter absolutely loved it.",November 2019,Webbs of Wychbold,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190798-d5496552-Reviews-Webbs_of_Wychbold-Droitwich_Worcestershire_England.html,"Droitwich, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,3.5

Excellent value,"Called in for quick snack and had the scone with jam and clotted cream with coffee. Also ordered toast and carton of custard for small grandson, all for under £7. Scone was homemade. Toast was thick granary with lots of butter. Breakfasts looked enormous and the sandwiches were chunky with lots of filling and side salad. Not for a special occasion but certainly worth a visit.

Must do restaurant,"We have been many times over the years and watched it grow until it virtually occupies the street but quality not compromised. Always offered an amuse bouche and crisp own baked bread rolls. Food is always exceptional quality and plenty on the plate, quite often we share particularly the suckling pig and lamb which can be huge. Fish is of high quality.

Pleasant country pub,"Cosy country pub in small village with busy bar full of locals. Dining area is separate with own small bar. Menu is reasonably varied with emphasis on steak which is well priced. Small problem with the menu as it is placed over other diners so quite embarrassing as it must spoil their meal if eating. Shared starters of olives, bread, whitebait and pate. Apparently the steaks were really good and cooked as ordered.he lamb shank was large and tasty. I had seabass which was on the small side but cooked correctly. One dessert was disappointing but overall everyone enjoyed the meal . With 2 bottles of wine and drinks it worked out at 40 pound per head.
