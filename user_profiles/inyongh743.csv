"Clean, friendly place - great location!","We stayed here for 3 nights and had a great time. The location is great- it's less than 10 minute walk to the Old Town and the beach - best of both worlds! The rooms were clean and functional, and we were glad that the air con was working very well! The staff were really helpful and they were careful to follow all the covid regulations - even sanitizing the keys before giving it to us!",July 2020,Angela Suites + Lobby,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635613-d1718952-Reviews-Angela_Suites_Lobby-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",hotels,5.0,3.5
"A nice beach, the diving platform was great!","It's a nice sandy beach, really nice to relax on and have a swim. There were a lot a deck chairs and althought I imagine you're supposed to pay, we went quite late in the afternoon and no one really made us pay! The waters are lovely to swim in, and very clean as you can tell by the little fish that you can see. The sea gets deep quite quickly though so watch out. The highlight was the diving platform- scary but really fun!",July 2020,Paralia Elli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635613-d1554833-Reviews-Paralia_Elli-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Excellent Greek taverna,"We normally try to avoid restaurants with someone at the entrance trying to bring the punters in but we were glad that we got taken in! The restaurant is on a lovely, quiet square looking onto an old mosque. The food seemed pretty authentically Greek and we just went with their recommendations! The staff were all very friendly and the service was great! It was our first meal in Greece and we had a great time!",July 2020,To Megiston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635613-d2223052-Reviews-To_Megiston-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
The postcard Greek island village of Rhodes,"If you want to see the classic whitewashed Greek island village on Rhodes, this the place. You have to walk through quite a lot of it to get up to the Acropolis anyway, but we also enjoyed walking around its narrow alleyways and popping into souvenir shops to explore. The only difficulty is that it was VERY hot when we went so make sure you move slowly!",July 2020,Village of Lindos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g227884-d523855-Reviews-Village_of_Lindos-Lindos_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Great ruins, fantastic views","This is the highlight of Lindos and it's really worth the hike up to the top of the hill, even in the hot afternoon sun. It's full of old ruins in various states to conservation / renovation and is an interesting mix of ancient Greek / Roman times as well as some medieval ages. Make sure you have plenty of water and carry a hat as it can get very hot with not a lot of shade. The views from the top are also magnificent.",July 2020,Acropolis of Lindos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g227884-d621960-Reviews-Acropolis_of_Lindos-Lindos_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Delicious sandwiches and wraps,"This little place was a great lunch place for us. It doesn't do anything particularly fancy, but the wraps and the sandwiches on offer were delicious, with fresh, healthy ingredients. The refreshing drinks were also perfect after a long day or walking in the hot sun. It might be hard to find, but worth it!",July 2020,Village Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g227884-d5312531-Reviews-Village_Cafe-Lindos_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fantastic fresh fish,"This was one of the best meals we had in Greece. They clearly care very much about giving you the freshest seafood possible, and the ones that are not (i.e. frozen) are clearly marked on the menu. They were very busy, even though the visitor numbers were down, so if you are coming here under more normal circumstances, make sure you book ahead! I really liked the stuffed calamari but I imagine anything will be good!",July 2020,Pizanias Kyriakos The Sea Star,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635613-d1776029-Reviews-Pizanias_Kyriakos_The_Sea_Star-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice to run around the old stadium,"With so many amazing sites to choose from, you won't be missing much by skipping this place. The remaining columns from a temple were all covered by scaffolds, and the site was very overgrown. I did manage to do a few laps around the old stadium, which was probably the most memorable part for me.",July 2020,The Acropolis of Rhodes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635613-d243158-Reviews-The_Acropolis_of_Rhodes-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0
A unique experience,"As the name suggests, there are a lot of butterflies here! It was a really cool experience, and walking around the wooded pathways was a nice break from all the historical sights and beaches. You have to climb quite a lot of stairs, mostly in the shade which is fine. There is also a monastery at the top, which involves even more climbing, but the view from up there is very much worth the effort.",August 2020,Valley of the Butterflies,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2699667-d254499-Reviews-Valley_of_the_Butterflies-Petaloudes_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.5
"Wonderful views, decent food","The views from the restaurant over the sea is simply stunning - it would be worth coming here just for that! The food was pretty good as well, the gyros set menu we had for lunch was very filling! The service was a little slow but it's not a problem unless you're in a hurry.",July 2020,Akrogiali Oi Didymoi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g8294925-d10384751-Reviews-Akrogiali_Oi_Didymoi-Kalavarda_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Excellent ruins with views over the sea,"This used to be a sizeable city and you can easily get a sense of the scale by walking around the ruins. There are very good information board (like most places in Greece!) which tell you about the history. The views are stunning - the sea to one side and mountains on the other. Lindos was great, but I think this is very much a hidden gem.",July 2020,Ancient Kamiros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g8294925-d254500-Reviews-Ancient_Kamiros-Kalavarda_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A stunning sunset,"There isn't much to 'do' here but you come here for the views, especially the stunning sunset. Get here early and pick a good spot, because there were quite a lot of people here even when the visitor numbers were down due to Covid. You can explore the ruins, and the remains on a old chapel is particular is quite cool to walk around. It can be quite windy here so be careful! The views in the changing light of the sunset is breathtaking.",July 2020,Monolithos Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189449-d678780-Reviews-Monolithos_Castle-Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great fast food joint,"We were absolutely exhausted after a long day of exploring so popped in for a quick dinner before hitting the sack. We chose well though! I got a really nice burger with chicken, egg and bacon (a new combination for me), and went home satisfied. It looks like a typical fast food place, but I think you'll be able to try something a little different from home.",July 2020,Chicken Stories,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635613-d12350910-Reviews-Chicken_Stories-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
A magical place to explore,"Walking around Rhodes Old Town really feels like going back in time. The walls and a lot of the building are very well preserved, but at the same time it is still very much a functioning city. Come in the evening to avoid the heat and to see the city come more to life as bars and restaurants open up. Try to avoid the main touristy thoroughfare with the shops selling mainly tacky souvenirs. It can get quite dark and scary in some of the narrow alleyways though - be prepared!",July 2020,Medieval City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635613-d254498-Reviews-Medieval_City-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Lovely building, so much to see, but can get very hot","It was great to be able to go inside one of the medieval buildings of the Old Town. The building itself and the gardens which it surround are really lovely to see. The exhibits are extensive as well, and there is so much to see, with really good accompanying information. Make sure you are prepared for the proper sweat fest though! It was very hot when we went, and there is no air conditioning in most rooms on account of the age of the building I guess. The compulsory wearing of masks due to Covid makes this even harder. Still, it was worth it!",July 2020,Archaeological Museum of Rhodes (Hospital of the Knights),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635613-d737236-Reviews-Archaeological_Museum_of_Rhodes_Hospital_of_the_Knights-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecan.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Lovely setting, decent food","We walked past here one evening and it looked like a really nice setting. We came back for lunch, and it was still very good! The garden setting in the heart of the Old Town is lovely. The place feels a bit too touristy for my liking but the service was friendly and the food was good. But one tip - don't get the boiling hit moussaka on a hot day!",July 2020,Socratous Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635613-d2153609-Reviews-Socratous_Garden-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Fantastic location, amazing views, friendly staff","If you're looking for somewhere to stay on Patmos, this is the place. It's only a short walk from the harbour but away from the main town, so it feels quiet and intimate. The rooms look out onto the amazing sea view. The facilities are pretty standard but it was very clean and tidy when we arrived. The staff are also really friendly and always up for a chat and helping you out. Look no further!",August 2020,Blue Bay Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2254319-d253713-Reviews-Blue_Bay_Hotel-Skala_Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
5 stars for the Kallikatsou rock,"The beach itself is nothing to shout about - pebbly beach with a few expensive deckchairs on it (we brought our own beach towels). What makes the place special is the Kallikatsou rock, which stands out into the water at the end of it. You can scramble up to the top of it, and explore some of the man made markings on it from when monks used to stay on it. You also get a lovely view of the surrounding seas and the beaches. The water is also very clear to swim it.",July 2020,Petra Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189447-d14930014-Reviews-Petra_Beach-Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.5
Excellent fresh local food,"If you are around the Petra beach area, this is the place to go. We had a late lunch here, and had a great time. Everything tasted very fresh, and I think there is even a garden / farm on site where they grow the lot of the stuff. The staff are very friendly, and the service was great.",July 2020,Ktima Petra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1191826-d2315254-Reviews-Ktima_Petra-Grikos_Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice secluded beach,"It takes a drive down to the southern end of the island and the 30 minute walk to get to this isolated beach, but it was well worth it. The walk out to the beach was nice, and though it's not particularly challenging, you might struggle if you're just wearing flip flops. There's plenty of shade all along the beach, but I can imagine it might get a lot busier when tourist numbers pick up. The sea is nice to swim in, but there is a lot of seaweed and other detritus in the water so just be aware (maybe we were unlucky?). There is also a small bar / cafe there to get a few drinks and snacks. The sunset here should be also be lovely, but we couldn't stick around so can't vouch for that!",July 2020,Psili Ammos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189447-d7155937-Reviews-Psili_Ammos_Beach-Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
I wish I could give it 6 stars!,"This is truly one of the best restaurants I've eaten at. The location is just amazing, sitting at a table on the beach looking right out into the sea. It's got a great atmosphere - we were there when tourism was down a lot but the place was still heaving with locals and visitors alike. The food is great - definitely have the octopus with fava and the seafood salad. Next time we will definitely go for the saganaki, which they bring to you table still flaming!",July 2020,To Tsipouradiko Mas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189447-d6739712-Reviews-To_Tsipouradiko_Mas-Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent place for breakfast,It's located in the heart of Skala - you can't miss it. We went to a few places on the square and I think this is my favourite (at least for breakfast!). The service was quick and the friendly. The food and drinks were great - make sure you try the almond drink and the Greek style omelette!,August 2020,Houston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189447-d7063184-Reviews-Houston-Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Quite a small site, but you get a sense of the spiritual significance","This the monastery built around the cave where St John is believed to written the Book of Revelations. As a functioning monastery and chapel, you get the spiritual significance of the place. There is not much to see, as the cave is quite small, but you can see some frescoes, and nice details like the niche in the rock which St John is supposed to have used when getting up from his prayers. We also managed to come at a time when they were having a Greek Orthodox service, which made the experience more special. It's not a big places, but an interesting historical place as well as place for quite prayer / contemplation.",August 2020,Cave of Apocalypse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189447-d207185-Reviews-Cave_of_Apocalypse-Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
"An awesome fortress monastery, still functioning","It really looks more like a fortress than a monastery from below the hill, but inside, you can see some wonderful frescoes and see that it's still very much a functioning monastery. This also means that you're not allowed to take photos in any indoor spaces, including the surprisingly extensive museum they have there. The views you get from the top all they way down the rest of Patmos and the sea are also wonderful. As always, make sure you are dressed modestly. There is a bus that takes you all the way up to Chora from Skala, but it still involves a bit of a walk. If you don't mind a bit more exercise and sweating profusely, you can also walk up from the Cave monastery, which was nice!",August 2020,Monastery of St. John,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189447-d207187-Reviews-Monastery_of_St_John-Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Come for the sunset,"We had a really nice time here and was glad that we came during sunset. You can get a table right on the beach which offer amazing views. The food was decent, but the only issue was that there was a bit of misunderstanding which meant that we didn't get one of our mains! But still, worth walking out here from the centre just for the sunset views.",July 2020,Oklacà,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2254319-d3584826-Reviews-Oklaca-Skala_Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Wonderful cocktails and views,"We had a wonderfully warm welcome from the German owner here, who showed us to our table on the roof and explained the different cocktails to us. The views are incredible- you can see Chora and the monastery at the top lit up, and also the harbour too. The cocktails were also very tasty. I think the only shame was the lack to people (I guess tourism was still quite hard hit by Covid at that point) which meant that there wasn't much of an atmosphere, although it did feel very intimate!",July 2020,Art Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2254319-d9779709-Reviews-Art_Cafe-Skala_Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Magical, wonderful beach","You have to walk 20-25 minutes from the main harbour, and it's definitely worth it. It must be quite a well known spot, because by the time we got there, there were already a few other people there, and it was tricky to find room in the shade under the tree! The water is so clear and warm, and swimming with goggles you can see so much life in the sea (but nothing scary!). We had a wonderful time relaxing here.",August 2020,Tiganakia Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3157828-d21201000-Reviews-Tiganakia_Beach-Arkoi_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Arkoi, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Lovely place to stop by for a drink,"We stopped by here for a cold drink to escape the sun and catch our breath after arriving on the island via the ferry.

Great food - both quality and quantity!,"You don't have too much choice on Arki and but we really loved our late lunch here. We got a really nice table overlooking the harbour (but still in the shade - very important!) and was served by a nice Athenian who comes to the island every summer! The food was tasty, and more importantly, plentiful.

Fantastic from start to finish,We went to this place on the recommendation from our hotel and it didn't disappoint! We got a lovely table looking right onto the harbour. The service was great - they recommended a few things off the menu and the specials which were all fantastic. We tried to stick to tavernas on our trip and this place was one of the best.

"Great exhibits, but would like to see our imperial legacy addressed","We came to see the Ai Weiwei art installation, and also went around the Holocaust exhibit. Both were excellent. The Holocaust section in particular was so comprehensive in its scope yet at the same time told individual stories - both good and bad. Hard hitting but a really moving exhibit. My only feedback for the museum would be that ironically for a museum which has the word 'Imperial' in it, I don't think there is much discussion around Britain's shameful imperial legacy. I think this is something that needs to be looked at urgently, especially given the attention the issue of history is receiving as part of the BLM movement.",August 2020,Imperial War Museums,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187674-Reviews-Imperial_War_Museums-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Aubrey Beardsley is excellent,"I visited with my sister to see the Aubrey Beardsley exhibition, which was excellent. You have to book ahead online due to Covid restrictions and have to wear a mask, but I thought the staff did a great job of making the space feel welcome. It did feel like it got a little too busy at times but it was fine overall. It's not on for much longer so see it while you still can!

Incredible history and views - bring water and a hat,"We felt very privileged to be here when there really weren't many people due to the ongoing Covid situation. We visited early afternoon, which in any other year would have meant long queues and sharing the site with many other people. Instead, it felt pretty quiet, and you could really take your time over it. It was extremely hot, and there is not much shade at the top, so please bring a hat and a water bottle (there is a drinking fountain where you can refill). The scale of the whole site (not just the Parthenon) is very impressive and there is really detailed information boards through the place to tell you about the history. The views of the city is amazing too. If you plan to be in Athens for a few days, definitely get the €30 combo ticket which also gives you access to loads of other historical sites.",August 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
The top floor is incredible - give yourself time!,"We came here after looking around Acropolis and I think that was the right choice. The museum takes you through the artefacts found on and around the Acropolis, starting with more of the daily life stuff, and working their way through the more important buildings on the Acropolis. The highlight though is the top floor which showcases the Parthenon marbles. The room and the marbles are laid out in the same orientation as the Parthenon, which you can see as you look out of the window. We were there late in the afternoon, which bathed the room in a beautiful glow. We ran out of time a little, which meant that we had to rush a little, and had to miss out entirely the foundation of the cityscape they found during the construction which they preserved in the basement. The restaurant is also very nice and gives you a chance to take your mask off! It's definitely a must see!",August 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Authentic Greek place in a very touristy area,"We came here for dinner after a long, hot day walking around the Acropolis. We could have gone to any of the very touristy places but decided to walk a few more steps for what we hoped would be a more authentic place, and we weren't disappointed. The service is very friendly, and the place is full of locals which creates a nice atmosphere. The food was good, and the portions were HUGE.

"Incredible, magical place","All the monasteries in Meteora are amazing, and since this was the first one we visited, it was one that left a big impression on us. The frescoes are lovely and the chapel is gorgeous. There is also a small exhibit on the part the monasteries played in the Greek fight for independence, complete with old posters.

"No stairs, very strict dress code","Maybe it was because this was the last monastery we visited, or maybe because we didn't have to climb any stairs to get to the monastery, but it didn't feel as special as some of the other ones we visited in Meteora.

Incredible! Even as a day trip from Athens,"We heard about Meteora but didn't have too much time, so unfortunately had to do a day-trip from Athens. The whole place they simply magical, and despite the long, tiring day, it was definitely worth it. You can get an early train that gets into Kalabaka at around 12, and a return train that leaves at around 5pm. We managed to visit 4 of the 6 monasteries, and with slightly better planning, could have done 5! I recommend getting the taxi up to the Grand Meteoron, then walk to Varlaam. Then you can walk to Rosanou, and then get another taxi to Holy Trinity. From there, we walked down to the train station. The bus which goes up to the monasteries from Kalabaka is not running due to Covid. Make sure you are wearing / have modest clothes as the monateries can be quite strict about this.",August 2020,Meteora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1070999-d523805-Reviews-Meteora-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

Well worth a visit on the combo ticket,"This is one of the places you can visit on the €30 combo ticket, and is probably the best one on the list after the Acropolis and the Ancient Agora. You can get a good view of the place from outside, but it's worth going in to have a look around. In particular, the Tower on the Winds is a really interesting octagonal building get a close look at.",August 2020,Roman Agora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242841-Reviews-Roman_Agora-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
You might as well with the combo ticket!,"There's not a lot to see on this site, but since it's on the €30 combo ticket, and being so close to the Ancient Agora and the Roman Agora you might as well pop into have a look! The information boards as ever are very well done. Don't forget to look for the traces of the fresco left on the wall by the entrance that shows where a church used to be!",August 2020,Hadrian's Library,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d6739897-Reviews-Hadrian_s_Library-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,3.5
A must-see sight in Athens,"As impressive as the Acropolis as is, I found exploring the huge site of the Ancient Agora equally as impressive. This contains the remains of the ancient Greek / Roman city centre, and even though most of the buildings are in ruins, you still get a good idea of the scale of the place. I spent more than 2 hours walking around, and could easily have spent more. The highlight is the Temple of Hephaestus, an amazingly well-preserved temple, and the well-curated museum exhibiting artefacts related to the life in the ancient city. You need a mask for the museum (Covid) and the place is included in the €30 combo ticket, which is think it a no-brainer if you're visiting Athens!",August 2020,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Interesting, informative visit with the combo ticket","This is one of the places that is included on the €30 combo ticket and I thought it was really interesting to see, though you can get a pretty good overview of the site from the outside. It's an ancient cemetery of Athens, and there are informative boards all around, like in most archaeological sites in Greece. There is also a small museum as well, for which you need a mask due to the Covid situation.",August 2020,Kerameikos Cemetery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242832-Reviews-Kerameikos_Cemetery-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
"A little hard to find, but worth it!","I stopped by for a rest and a drink after a long day of walking around town. It's a very cool, trendy place. There's a shaded courtyard area which wasn't too busy when I visited (maybe due to Covid?). Unfortunately all of the art galleries look to be closed due to Covid, which was a shame! The staff were friendly and didn't mind that I was chilling out for quite a while on just one drink. It's a little bit off the touristy areas but well worth it!",August 2020,Taf The Art Foundation,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d3335147-Reviews-Taf_The_Art_Foundation-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Come early for a morning jog!,"If you can motivate yourself, come for the 7.30-9.00 morning jog session - it's an awe-inspiring feeling to run around the tracks of this incredible historic stadium. You still need to pay the €5 entrance fee. There is an audio guide on offer, but you need to have an ID with you to give as a deposit. There is also a nice exhibit with past Olympic posters and torches, but since that is indoors, make sure you bring a mask. Take a walk up the stairs up the stands for a great view. If you go up at around tier 20, you get an incredible view of the Acropolis.

Impressive ruin - get the €30 combo ticket,"The remaining columns of the huge temple that used to be here is indeed impressive. Although you can see it from outside the sight, it is well worth going up close to see them. Having said that, there is not much else here so make sure you take advantage of the €30 combo ticket to see this and other similar sights. As with most other archaeological sights in Greece, the information boards are excellent. There is not much shade close to the columns to make sure you bring a hat!",August 2020,Temple of Olympian Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242844-Reviews-Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Only worth it with the €30 combo ticket,"There's really not a lot to see here, apart from the foundations of the building that used to form Aristotle's school. There is good information on the board to help you to imagine what it would have been like back in the day. I certainly wouldn't pay separately to visit this place, and even with the €30 combination ticket, don't feel too sad if you have to miss this place as it's a bit out the way compared to the other sights. If you're visiting, make sure you have a hat as there us not much shade here!",August 2020,Aristotle's Lyceum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d7718083-Reviews-Aristotle_s_Lyceum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,3.0
A lovely oasis to rest your legs,"It's a lovely (free!) park to rest your legs if you're feeling tired in the Athens sun. There's a pond with turtles and ducks and a small zoo which might keep some kids occupied for a while. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit it, but it's certainly worth popping into if you're in the neighbourbood.",August 2020,National Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d246658-Reviews-National_Garden-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
"Lovely food and atmosphere, but not great value","We had a great time here - the food is delicious and the atmosphere is really fantastic. It's certainly a trendy place! It's a Japanese place, but the food is definitely more in the fusion territory. Our only problem was the small portions, which added up to being quite expensive in the end. I wish we ordered a burger, which looked like the most substantial dish!",August 2020,Birdman,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d15144327-Reviews-Birdman-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Brilliantly curated museum,"This museum tells the story of Christian art in Greece, starting from the transition from the classical period all the way to the modern day. It was enlightening to see how famous ancient Greek sights like the Acropolis would have been transformed with the advent of Christianity and the history of Byzantine art is also handled really well. At the moment, it's also quiet due to Covid, so inconvenience of wearing masks aside, I found it to be a tranquil and peaceful visit. There are also two great temporary exhibitions: one of Japanese artists commemorating what would have been the 2020 Olympics, and another of Chinese rare stone art which includes some exquisite carvings. I would recommend getting the €15 combination ticket which also included entry to the National Archaeological Museum. The cafe is also a lovely place to chill out in the gardens of the villa that the museum is house in.",August 2020,Byzantine and Christian Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242815-Reviews-Byzantine_and_Christian_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Great food, cool ambience","We had a great time here - the atmosphere is very cool, it's a bit out of the way so it's not very touristy. The menu is quite modern, so if you're looking for a traditional Greek taverna place, this won't be what you're looking for but we found everything tasty. The service is friendly as well, and they really explain anything on the menu you don't understand.

Wonderful food and service,"We didn't make a reservation was a bit worried that we weren't going to get a table, but they kindly got us a table outside. The food is great - we got 5 small plates to share between the two of us and was stuffed by the end! The service is very attentive despite the busy atmosphere.

Wonderful ruins in a beautiful setting,"We did a day trip to Delphi from Athens and had a great time. The ruins of the Sanctuary of Apollo is absolutely beautiful, made even better by the dramatic mountain setting. We were lucky that we went the number of visitors was much smaller due to Covid, so it felt like we had the place to ourselves. It's a bit of a hike up to the top of the site to the stadium so make sure you where comfortable shoes. We got the 10.30 coach out and got the 18.00 return for €30, the entrance fee (which includes the nearby museum) is €12.",August 2020,Delphi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d523823-Reviews-Delphi-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
See it before the Sanctuary of Apollo if you can,"We decided to see the museum first before the main archaeological site of Delphi to escape the rain, and we were glad we did. The exhibits help you to picture what the ruins would have looked like when you walk through it later. The ticket is a combination ticket so if you visit the site, the visit to the museum is automatically included. The only sad thing is that staff who hurry you along if it feels like you are spending more than 5 minutes you are allotted for each room due to Covid restrictions. As always, remember your mask!",August 2020,Delphi Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d199057-Reviews-Delphi_Archaeological_Museum-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Fantastic views, great food","We walked into this place a little unsure, but knew we chose well when saw the breathtaking views all the way down to the sea. The quality of food isn't dar behind either. We got a salad to share, then a goat stew and chicken pasta for mains, and a baklava to finish, all of which were very good and fresh. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.

A must for running enthusiasts,"If you have any interest in running or marathons, you will love this place. The place is packed with running memorabilia from marathons around the world, as well as those belonging to famous Greek runners. There's also really good information board giving you the story behind every single Olympic marathon races, ranging from the farcical (1904 and 1908) to astonishing (1952 and 1960). As a Korean, it was moving to read about the bittersweet triumph of Berlin and the gruelling win of Barcelona. It is very quiet (I was the only visitor in the museum the whole time I was there) so don't be put off if there's no one at the reception when you walk in. They'll be glad to see you I'm sure!",August 2020,Marathon Run Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g669631-d5002152-Reviews-Marathon_Run_Museum-Marathon_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Marathon, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Incredible, but shame about Covid restrictions","The museum is incredible - there is so much to see and you could easily spend the whole day in there to see everything properly. However, the Covid restrictions mean that you only get 10 minutes to see the famous Prehistoric Collection (with the Mycenean treasures), with the staff hurrying you along all the time. Although there is a lot to see, a few key galleries (e.g. the Egyptian Collection) are closed altogether. Be prepared to wait a bit if you arrive in the afternoon as the entrance is very slow due to distancing measures, and of course masks and mandatory. Having said all this it is a must see place if you're in Athens. Gallery 48, which contains the finds from Thera, is a particular highlight. The cafe downstairs is also a lovely place to rest your legs, with a well kept garden and statues from the Antikythera wreckage.",August 2020,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Fantastic local place!,"There's a lot of places in this area that look like tourist traps but this place feels legit. The food was great - we had the salad, pork and beef with tomato sauce and they were all excellent. The portions are generous and we even had to take leftovers home! Not sure how the prices compare to other places, but it was very affordable. We paid €25 for dinner for two, including wine.

Wonderful villa - worth a visit even if you don't love coins!,"Who knew there was a specific word which refer to coun collections?! It's a wonderful museum which takes you through the history of coins all the way from the ancient Greek times to the present day. There is enough to keep you busy for at least 2 hours. Even if you're not into coins, it's a wonderful building, and was the not-so-humble abode of Heinrich Schliemann (of the Troy excavation fame) and there's a lot of fascinating information about his story.

A wonderful cinematic experience,"If you have a free evening in Athens, this is a must. It's an outdoor cinema, and you can literally see the Acropolis from your seat. They have two showings each night, at 9 and 11 and if you go on Mon-Wed, the tickets are a little cheaper at €6. It feels like they tend to show the classics - I saw the original Italian Job, which was great!

Pop in with a combo ticket after National Archaeological Museum,"This little museum is right around the corner from the National Archaeological Museum. Understandably they don't get many visitors (the staff even thought I came to the wrong place!) but it's included on the €15 museum combo ticket so definitely pop in when you're doing the National Archaeological Museum. It's full of Greek inscriptions and the leaflet and the panels give you a lot of information. The staff are really friendly (I guess they don't get a lot of visitors nowadays) and they even gave me a sheet with an explanation of the Greek alphabet!

Incredible views of Athens,"This is probably where you can get the best view of the Acropolis, as well as other major sights of Athens, such as the Panathenaic Stadium and the Olympaieon. You can even see all the way to the sea! I imagine the best time to visit would be for the sunset but unfortunately I couldn't stick around! You can either walk up or get the funicular.

"A lovely, friendly meal - but not cheap!",I stopped by for a quick (late) lunch on the way to the funicular and initially balked at th e prices (much higher than other places I'd been to in Athens) but it ended up being a great stay! It's a really nice place with outdoor seating and white tablecloths (the kind of place where they scrape the breadcrumbs off!). The salad was lovely and they gave me a small bottle of homemade strawberry liqueur just to finish the meal off!

A trip to the bar is a decent alternative,"I can't vouch for the guided tour, because I just went to the bar and bought myself a Shirley Temple (14 MYR, a bit cheaper than the tour). I still had a pretty decent time, getting to enjoy the place a bit more rather than being herded through a limited section of the house. I caught the beginning of the tour on my way out and it seemed quite informative but nothing too special.

Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought it was pretty average. We only waited 10 minutes, but that was when we got there for 11.30am. We got all the recommended stuff (Xiao long bao etc.) which were fine, but nothing I've not had elsewhere in London.
