Will not use Alitalia again!!,"I was so happy last year when I used Alitalia but something has changed. It is not the same anymore. We were served a single pastry for breakfast. The air hostesses were really unfriendly. The foldout table of the passenger next to me was broken. We were seated tight behind premium economy and it would have been ideal to move him there since he paid extra for the little extra legroom he had. He didn't want the full service, he just wanted a table that worked. Don't fly with Alitalia!!!

"New menu, new prices, not the same","We are regular M&B visitors because of the size of the portions and the fact that it is value for money. Always been on the more expensive side of moderate but we have never had an issue with this. It has changed!!! When you have an item on the menu I expect this to be available. The scone was unavailable. The ""sliver"" of cake that was served to us was ridiculous. We had to send this back and what we got back was only slightly better. I personally had a Chicken and Sesame salad that was very tasty but I had to hunt to find the actual chicken.

Not all is well!,"The service was very good! The steaks were good but the baked chocolate milkskake that promised so much was a disaster. Not close to what was mentioned on the menu.

A sad experience!!!,I visit this establishment on a regular basis and I have never before had any reason to complain or even be dissatisfied. This last Saturday 31 August 2019 was very different however. Although the rest of my Big Ben dish was really good the English muffin was a complete disaster. The one half was burnt while the other half was so hard that I was unable to even cut into it with a knife. There was furthermore a table of patrons that was so noisy and loud that we sometimes could not even hear one another at our own table. I must admit that this will make me think twice before I visit again.,August 2019,Mugg & Bean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g5001415-d12999156-Reviews-Mugg_Bean-Emalahleni_Mpumalanga.html,"Emalahleni, South Africa",restaurants,2.0,4.0

There are many take sit down and take away eateries, as well as a shop that is always well stocked.

I do however think that Mugg and Bean should rethink the concept of their ""On the Move"" brand or learn from McD's and Burger King. This is not where you can currently position yourself.
