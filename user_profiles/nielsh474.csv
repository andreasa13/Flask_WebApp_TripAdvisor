"well organized place, good for lunch","I stopped here for a simple lunch while visiting the sites of the Somme battle. It was a good experience. I took the menu of the day which was veal liver with fries and salad, for less than 10 euro.
It tasted well. Service was friendly and fast. What more can you want?",October 2020,Hygge Café Brasserie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g666964-d2660346-Reviews-Hygge_Cafe_Brasserie-Albert_Somme_Hauts_de_France.html,"Albert, France",restaurants,5.0,4.0
a truly great museum,"This museum, already a grand building in itself, is a real wonderful museum. Especially its collection of paintings is superb, with dutch/flemish greats like Rubens, Breughel and van Dyck and also other great artists like the Picasso and the french impressionists. It is special that this great place only charges a 7 euro entrance fee (2020). In my country museums are much more expensive. Keep in mind that entrance is free on the first sunday of every month.",August 2020,Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187178-d269820-Reviews-Palais_des_Beaux_Arts_de_Lille-Lille_Nord_Hauts_de_France.html,"Lille, France",attractions,5.0,4.0
enormous bookshop,This is supposedly the biggest bookshop in France and it is really...well.. big...not just lots of books but also toys and other nice gifts. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable.,August 2020,Librairie Furet du Nord,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187178-d8453765-Reviews-Librairie_Furet_du_Nord-Lille_Nord_Hauts_de_France.html,"Lille, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
very beautiful old district,"Old Lille is a lovely place full of shops, historical buildings and life...just fun to wander around.",August 2020,Vieux-Lille,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187178-d7174290-Reviews-Vieux_Lille-Lille_Nord_Hauts_de_France.html,"Lille, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice place with good food,"I noticed that Rue de Gand has a lot of restaurants. I decided to have lunch here and was not disappointed. I tried the 'potjesvleesch', a local specialty and was served a very big portion. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The local beer I had was good as well.",August 2020,L´Estaminet de Gand,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187178-d13221022-Reviews-L_Estaminet_de_Gand-Lille_Nord_Hauts_de_France.html,"Lille, France",restaurants,5.0,4.0
rude and unprofessional waiters,When I sat down here for dinner I was completely ignored by the waiters. People arriving after me where served immediately. I asked politely for the menu and they responded incredibly rude after which I decided to leave and spend my money somewhere else. This bad experience was all the more strange since I noticed that people in Lille are in general friendly and helpful...but not at this place.,August 2020,Les 3 Brasseurs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187178-d784053-Reviews-Les_3_Brasseurs-Lille_Nord_Hauts_de_France.html,"Lille, France",restaurants,1.0,3.5
Always a good experience,"Over the years I have used Transavia a lot and they are a very reliable airline. No frills, they take you where you want to go and that is it. Food and drinks must be paid for. I never do this since flights are usually short (2-3 hours) and prices on board are high.
In my opinion both quality of crew and airplanes is high. I definetley recommend them.",March 2020,Transavia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729171-Reviews-Transavia,World,flights,5.0,3.5
tasty and healthy,"I am not very much into health food but decided to give this place a try. And I was pleasantly surprised! The food consisted of some pieces of fish, lots of veggies, rice and some peppers. It was fresh tasty and I noticed the rice is of good quality.
The place is just a hole in the wall, but staff are friendly and service is fast.",March 2020,Poke Hawaiian Sushi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12550077-Reviews-Poke_Hawaiian_Sushi-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
greek grill bonanza,"This place has an ultra touristy location and its waiters are doing their best to get you in. However in my opinion this place is much better than your average tourist restaurant.
They do grilled meats and I had a big plate with gyros and souflaki, salad and chips for less than 12 euro.
They also serve smaller portions ' on the go' . Popular with locals as well, so they are doing something right.",March 2020,Gyristroula,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3569773-Reviews-Gyristroula-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
expected a bit more,"I had lunch in this place in Kolonaki. This being the most posh district in central Athens prices are a bit higher than elsewhere.
The restaurant does its best to serve greek food with a twist and I tried chicken meat balls which did not make me happy at all. They were pretty tasteless and drowned in a lot of rather joyless sauce. The ' arab bread' coming with it was bland and missed the point.
The salad I ordered consisted just of some cut vegetables which you can buy in your local supermarket as well.
Service was not welcoming at all.",March 2020,Oikeio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d816414-Reviews-Oikeio-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Very good neigbourhood restaurant,"Exerchia district has a reputation for protests and unrest and walking into this part of town might not feel too cosy. However I was very surprised to find several nice restaurants , right next to Exerchia square. Apparently Rozalia is the best and I had a very good lunch here, rabbit in wine sauce. The dessert which I got from the house warmed my heart.
The place is very popular with greek visitors and has lots of atmosphere and good food.",March 2020,Rozalia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d814501-Reviews-Rozalia-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
THE archeological site,"If there is one archeological site in this world it is the acropolis off course....so much has been written about it that I cannot do it justice. Some tips: there is an entrance on the south west side which is usually more quiet than the main gate. Do not forget to walk around the hill, because it is very interesting and beautiful as well.",March 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"great museum, strange policiy with regard to photographing","Off course this museum is a must see and its collection is incredible. Really a nice concept of being able to see the sculptures from a close distance the way they were supposed to have been put on the temples.
However I found the attitude of staff towards photographers strange. Normally it is no problem taking pictures in a greek museum as long as you do not use flash. However there was one guard who sternly forbade all pictures while others did not mind....confusing.",March 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
excellent greek fastfood,"The place is super central and they clearly do SOUFLAKI....in an expert manner. Fast service, no frills. Meat from the grill, the way it should be. Also liked the very good tzatziki that came with the bread.",March 2020,En Athines Alexandra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d8496280-Reviews-En_Athines_Alexandra-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
"very good restaurant, a place with character","I liked this place because it has character. First of all,its location might be very central but it is not so easy to find. You will have to go into a cellar, right next to Manchester City hall. The place has been around for a very long time so they are doing something right.
The interior looks a bit charming and old fashioned. taff are very welcoming. I had an armenian goulash for lunch, which was an ample and tasty dish. Really liked it.",October 2019,Armenian Taverna & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d754280-Reviews-Armenian_Taverna_Restaurant-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5

good public transport system,"One of the little problems about Manchester is the fact that there is not one company responsible for public transport so there is no central system for tickets and schedules. For visitors this makes things a bit confusing.Luckily there is the metrolink system to fall back to. The name is a bit confusing since it is not a metro but a tram, though a very adequate one. I used it to go to Etihad stadium on a matchday and was impressed by the staff who managed to handle very large numbers of travellers in a competent and civilized manner.",October 2019,Manchester Metrolink,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187069-d8706601-Reviews-Manchester_Metrolink-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
The country that gave football to the world,"It is no surprise that England has a national football museum, after all, it invented the game. I liked the place even though it is one of the museums that are not free. They have lots of things that are unique: the head protection of Petr Czech, the shirt worn by Maradona in 1986 during the infamous game against England, a passport that belonged to Pele, shoes and even the final car of George Best...if you like the beautiful game you will have lots of fun here. For an extra charge you can play lots of interactive games.",October 2019,National Football Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187069-d579319-Reviews-National_Football_Museum-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
a modern center of history,"This is perhaps the most historical building of the entire city and it has seen a lot, from the times that Manchester was just a small market town to the gigantic industrial explosion and then the blitz during which it was hit by bombs. But it is still standing. Friendly volunteers will make you feel welcome and do their best to answer questions. There are lots of interesting details in the medieval architecture (green men, monkeys with bottles in the chairs in the choire).",October 2019,Manchester Cathedral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187069-d188924-Reviews-Manchester_Cathedral-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
a really interesting museum,"It is special but maybe not surprising that an early capitalist mecca like Manchester has a museum dedicated to the struggle of ordinary people for basic (voting) rights and humane working conditions.
Lots of interesting things to see, especially the large banners of workers associations. There was a special exhibition on Peterloo. What I missed: some more info on conditions in the factories of Manchester and initiatives to improve this. I also would have liked some more info on Engels and Marx and their time in Manchester since I think that would be relevant.",October 2019,People's History Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187069-d188922-Reviews-People_s_History_Museum-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
a bit tacky,This place is labelled as ' Manchester museum' but it does not really teach you anything about the history of the city (like for instance the Liverpool museum). In stead it is just a collection of fossills and stuffed animals curated by the local university. They should have a large collection of antiquities but unfortunately that section had been closed completely.,October 2019,The Manchester Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187069-d1460366-Reviews-The_Manchester_Museum-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5

great modern stadium,"went to the match ManCity-Wolverhampton. overall a very good experience. Stadium easy to reach by metrolink. Lots of activities and food options pre match.

Good city hotel,I have stayed here for 5 days in october. The hotel is fine and I have no real criticism. Room was ok though not perfectly clean (especially the shower). Toilet did not flush very well. Breakfast was really good. Location is close to the center. Staff were friendly. Convenient location close to public transport (both Piccadilly and Oxford road railway station nearby).,October 2019,Ibis Manchester Centre Princess Street Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187069-d219545-Reviews-Ibis_Manchester_Centre_Princess_Street_Hotel-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
