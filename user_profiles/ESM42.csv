Delicious Lunch,This is a fantastic restaurant. The staff are excellent and the food is delicious.

Very nice bar meal.,"We had a lovely family meal here. The decor in the restaurant isn't the best but it's clean, the food is delicious and the staff are friendly. The menu has a wide choice and plenty of vegetarian options. It is also reasonably priced.
They are doing a great job in what must be difficult circumstances. I will definitely gi back on my next trip North.",August 2020,The 1645 Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g20094338-d20092542-Reviews-The_1645_Inn-Auldearn_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Auldearn, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,5.0
Halloween Heaven,"Really fun place to visit. Yes, it's pricey and yes, the food is so sugary it's unbelievable but the whole thing is obviously meant as a gimmick and that's why you go. We found the staff very pleasant. Not sure if I would take a very young or nervous child in at Halloween but we loved it.",October 2019,Little Kook,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d9710322-Reviews-Little_Kook-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Amphorae overload.,"Despite being billed as the best museum in Greece we found this a little dull. There are only so many pots you can look at. The shop is lightly stocked with very expensive items and no tourist tat.
The best bit is the cafe which opens out into a beautiful courtyard and contains some of the most interesting sculptures. It also sells delicious baklava.",October 2019,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Highlight of our trip,The walk up to the Acropolis and wandering around was the best thing we did by far. It's a stiffish climb and can be very hot and windy at the top (wear sun cream!) but just to be there is amazing. It would be a terrible shame to visit Athens and not experience this.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful,"Astonishing exhibits in a beautiful, airy space. It's best to get there early as the queues built up around 10.30. You have to put your bag in their cloakroon so make sure any valuables are on your person.
Very inadequate cafe which only served drinks, no food. The two ladies toilets available were also completely inadequate and the queue was almost as long as the one to get in.",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Excellent Staff,"This is a very clean, comfortable hotel with excellent staff who were very friendly and welcoming. It's a rough area but no-one bothered us. It's a bit of a walk through some very run down areas to get to the city centre but the metro is easy to use and there is a station nearby. The receptionist warned us about pickpockets and he wasn't kidding. Our bags were opened on several occasions on the metro but thanks to the warning wallets and phones were out of reach!
I found it a little strange that a fridge is standard but coffee trays are only in deluxe rooms, but maybe that's a Greek thing. Also bring ear plugs as the area is very noisy at night
Breakfast is a little limited in choice but everything is fresh and tasty.
Overall good value for money, I would definitely stay again.",October 2019,Areos Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d1160295-Reviews-Areos_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Airport Transfer,"The airport transfer service is not the cheapest way to get to central Athens but as we arrived late at night and don't know the city we were very glad we'd booked this service.

My New Favourite Restuarant,"I wish I could give this restaurant 6 stars, it is brilliant. The staff were friendly and attentive without being over bearing. The decor is lovely ( someone has even made them a patchwork cushion). The standard of the food and wine was astonishing. Quite simply one of the best meals I have ever had!

Complete Waste of Time,"We had this booked for weeks and were really looking forward to it. We drove for an hour to get there but when we arrived there was no-one there. We tried to call them and waited for an hour before giving up and leaving. Someone did leave a rather snotty voicemail a few hours later saying we had not booked a trek and that they were away for the weekend. I've attached a screenshot of the booking!!
The alpacas we saw looked lovely and I'm sure it would've been delightful to meet
them but as it was this was a complete waste of our Sunday. Please be warned and don't waste your valuable time!",April 2019,Velvet Hall Alpacas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1129826-d6674808-Reviews-Velvet_Hall_Alpacas-Innerleithen_Scottish_Borders_Scotland.html,"Innerleithen, United Kingdom",attractions,1.0,5.0
The Kaleyard,Friday night is pizza night at this informal cafe. The menu is quite limited but everything was of high quality and delicious.

Disappointing,"We drove to Burghead specially because we had heard so many good things about The Bothy, especially the Cullen Skink, unfortunately the experience was not good. There was no Cullen Skink today and the broccoli soup they had instead was very bland. The chicken liver pate was runny(!) and the accompanying red onion jam was completely tasteless. We did tell the waitress who said she would inform the chef but we got no reply. We left shortly after rather than spend more money in this poor establishment.",April 2019,The Bothy Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g4926638-d2292716-Reviews-The_Bothy_Bistro-Burghead_Moray_Scotland.html,"Burghead, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Lovely place for lunch.,"This is a lovely pub. Just the place for a nice lunch after walking on the beach. The food was excellent and the staff were friendly. Service was quick and the toilets were clean. Best of all, we were allowed to bring our dog in.",March 2019,The Ship Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315944-d1777183-Reviews-The_Ship_Inn-North_Berwick_East_Lothian_Scotland.html,"North Berwick, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Bring ear plugs,"The building and grounds are beautiful and the public rooms are very opulent but cosy with open fires and wood burning stoves. All the staff have clearly been well trained and give the impression of taking a pride in doing their jobs well. They were all very competant and professional.
The food and drinks were excellent if somewhat pricey.
We had a standard double room which was quite small with a view onto the kitchen but it was comfortable and clean. There wasn't good enough water pressure for a decent shower and the hairdryer didn't work. My main advice would be TAKE EAR PLUGS. Every time the person in the room upstairs moved it sounded like a herd of elephants and woke us up several times. The ceiling was creaking alarmingly and you could hear the wardrobe door being opened and shut and the toilet being used!
We got some ear plugs at the nearby Asda and had a much better sleep the next night.
The old part of the hotel is so beautiful, it's a shame the room was so average. Not sure if we would stay again.",January 2019,Macdonald Norwood Hall Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186487-d193947-Reviews-Macdonald_Norwood_Hall_Hotel-Aberdeen_Aberdeenshire_Scotland.html,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
Beautiful beach,Beautiful beach. Best for walking/running when the tide is out a bit. Very sandy with some stones and things to stop tanks landing.,January 2019,Findhorn Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551765-d6765000-Reviews-Findhorn_Beach-Findhorn_Forres_Moray_Scotland.html,"Findhorn, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice food in a quaint pub,A cute pub used by locals and visitors. Probably best to book a table as it can be very busy. Order at the bar and food is served to your table. Excellent pub grub and a beautiful view over the bay from the front room.,January 2019,Kimberley Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551765-d732304-Reviews-Kimberley_Inn-Findhorn_Forres_Moray_Scotland.html,"Findhorn, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Average,"We booked a table in the restaurant some time ago but on arrival were directed to a table in the bar beside the door. The staff did, after a little stalling, give us a restaurant table as booked. The menu was reasonable but they had run out of several items, including vanilla ice cream(!), and the vegetarian options sounded unappetising. When it arrived the food and wine were average apart from the Cullen Skint which was DELICIOUS and the cauliflower steak which was horrible. The people serving (all teenagers) were friendly and pleasant but a bit chaotic. They clearly meant well but would benefit from professional training.",December 2018,The Old Mill Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551767-d1734260-Reviews-The_Old_Mill_Inn-Forres_Moray_Scotland.html,"Forres, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Wonderful hotel.,"My second visit to this hotel and I was not disappointed. I was with my elderly aunt and all the staff were extremely helpful and kind. Reception helped us organise a mobility scooter so she could get around.
We opted for the privilege bed and breakfast but upgraded to half board on the advice of Valarie and Kevin. It was a great deal. We enjoyed all the restaurants and the Bravissimo cabaret was an absolute treat.
The Thalasso spa was a lovely way to spend a cloudy afternoon.
It may well be that this will be my aunt's last holiday as her health is failing and I want to thank everyone for making it so special.",October 2018,H10 Conquistador,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562820-d500579-Reviews-H10_Conquistador-Playa_de_las_Americas_Arona_Tenerife_Canary_Islands.html,"Tenerife, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.5
Waste of a day.,"We were picked up on time. Several kilometres into the journey we were informed the cable car wasn't working due to high winds. I wish we had been told when boarding as we wouldn't have bothered as this was the highlight of the trip. We had a brief stop at a pleasant cafe in Vilaflor then up to Teidi. The hotel herr is horrible! Only one person serving despie the huge number of visitors, no plates(!), overpriced and €1 to use the toilet. You have no choice but to use their facilities. We were there for an hour. The landscape is dramatic but very busy with people. The journey home was awful, very long and boring. We were relieved to get off.",October 2018,Teide National Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187479-d2201799-Reviews-Teide_National_Park-Tenerife_Canary_Islands.html,"Tenerife, Spain",attractions,2.0,4.5
Average says it all.,The menu looked great but I think it oversold the food. It was ok but the bread with the main and the cookies with dessert were both as hard as rocks. The servers were all very pleasant and the sweet potato fries were delicious but overall I think you csn get much better food for similar prices in other nearby restaurants. In that area I much prefer The Smoke Stack or Pommegranate.,July 2018,Treacle Bar and Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d1590332-Reviews-Treacle_Bar_and_Kitchen-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0

A Wonderful Afternoon,Even the bucketing rain couldn't spoil our enjoyment of this wonderful place. Meeting and greeting is done by a llama who clearly understands her job. She walks along the field by the car park and offers everone a kiss!! There is also a very helpful human lady who explains how to get food for the animals in case you don't speak llama. All the animals have the choice to interact with you or not ( most do if you have food) and are kept in excellent conditions. The staff are friendly and can tell you all about each donkey.So happy to see these animals so well cared for.,April 2018,The Scottish Borders Donkey Sanctuary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2137530-d8451438-Reviews-The_Scottish_Borders_Donkey_Sanctuary-Newtown_St_Boswells_Scottish_Borders_Scotl.html,"Newtown St Boswells, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5

Tasty and authentic,"I've been here a few times and would happily recommend it. I love the decor and all the middle eastern lamps, cushions and trinkets. The staff are welcoming and look after you well without being intrusive.

Perfectly good 4* hotel.,"Excellently situated for exploring Prague. About a 40 minute drive from The airport and a 10 minute walk to Wenceslas Square.
The reception staff were all very friendly and helpful. They are happy to arrange trips and taxis for you should you wish.
The room was clean and comfortable and the buffet breakfast was very comprehensive.
I would happily stay here again, the only reasons I have not given 5 stars are that the extractor fan in the bathroom didn't work and they only start serving breakfast at 7.30 which was too late for us on the day we flew home.",August 2017,Hotel Raffaello,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d321174-Reviews-Hotel_Raffaello-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,4.0,4.0

Perfect location,"We had a privilege package which was definitely worth the extra cost. The a la carte restaurants are wonderful and we particularly enjoyed our breakfasts in the Italian restaurant. The privilege balcony and use of the Thalasso Centre were also great perks.
The rooms are not terribly well appointed eg.lack of drawer space, wobbly desk, fridge door squint, but the standard of housekeeping is excellent and the beds are very comfortable. We also had a wonderful view.
Our hostesses Evelyn and Daniella were extremely friendly and welcoming but do double check anything you book through them as errors were made with our restaurant bookings and check out times.
The location is perfect and you have access from the garden to the promenade/beach. At the other side you are very near the shops, restaurants and entertainment of the town.
At busy times it can be difficult to get a lift so we used the stairs but more or bigger lifts would be good.

Fantastic plat du jour.,This restaurant is competitively priced and the plat du jour (fish) was the nicest fish I've had in a very long time. The propriotress and staff were very pleasant. I would be happy to go again but I have to say the wine was quite tasteless and the only thing in the toilet to dry hands on was a screwed up wet towel.,May 2016,Le Medieval,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g488277-d2212470-Reviews-Le_Medieval-Saint_Emilion_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Saint-Emilion, France",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Best way to see the town.,"Saint Emillion is a beautiful, medieval town famous for it's wine production. A tuk tour is a great way to find out about it's history and the many things to do and see there. All the staff were very friendly and happy to provide a tour in English. The tickets are €10 per person and we felt it was well worth it.",May 2016,Tuk Tour Event's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g488277-d10259273-Reviews-Tuk_Tour_Event_s-Saint_Emilion_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Saint-Emilion, France",attractions,5.0,5.0
Perfect file and polish.,I got my toenails filed and polished and was very happy with the service I received. I hadn't booked but the girls fitted me in plenty of time before my flight and provided disposable flip flops so my polish didn't smudge. I really appreciated the service and found it very good value for money.,May 2016,AeroSpa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d7142145-Reviews-AeroSpa-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Very enjoyable and relaxing.,"I had the float and 30 min massage @ £72. I would say it was definitely worth it as I enjoyed the float and the massage was excellent. There was nice shampoo and shower gel to use and everything seemed very clean. The staff were lovely, slightly less keen on the manageress. She was pleasant enough but a little in your face, not ideal when you're very relaxed and feeling a bit dreamy.",May 2016,Floatarium Day Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d3358740-Reviews-Floatarium_Day_Spa-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,3.0
Flawless.,We have had a wonderful weekend at Macdonald Marine. The room was great and the view spectacular. We couldn't fault the food or the service and the thermal suite was bliss. North Berwick itself is also a lovely town. Just a perfect place to relax and recharge.,April 2016,Marine & Spa North Berwick,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315944-d280882-Reviews-Marine_Spa_North_Berwick-North_Berwick_East_Lothian_Scotland.html,"North Berwick, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
