Relax! No noise!! I'm happy,"Well, we arrive in Athens around mid august. We choice Grand Hyatt first of all because is a Hyatt that means quality, and second for the dimension of the rooms.

The best in South America,"In my opinion, LATAM is the best in South America. Plenty destinations, pretty good machine, but sometimes the 319 or 320 has poor space for the legs. For the medium long flight I suggest to verify if it is available a 787 or similar. Punctuality is one of their strenght. The cost for the flights are a little bit higher of other companies, but in my opinion the punctuality and availability is all I need for my best comfort and to have a good holiday!!",September 2019,LATAM Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d10290698-Reviews-LATAM-Airlines,World,flights,4.0,3.5
