Very pleasant,"Having traveled with many budget airlines and this being the first time traveling with British airways, all I can say is there is 100% a difference in standards.

Great flight no complaints whatsoever,
Leg room... good I’m 6”1 and had no trouble in standard seating!
Comfortable and good quality seats.

If this is the standard I can expect every time I will be booking all my future flights with British airways.

I will update this review after my next flight hoping the great standards remain and bring a positive review again.",April 2019,British Airways,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729039-Reviews-British-Airways,World,flights,4.0,3.5
Not the best,"Very flash looking museum lots of money spent on the building and up keep.
Would not advise this museum for learning the history of Athens as information on the artefacts is somewhat basic.

Was also told by the locals that the national archeological museum was better for learning the history of Athens.

What we did learn at the acropolis Museum is that a lot of the artefacts are copies of the originals as most of them have been stolen or destroyed.",April 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Very cool,"Great vibes as you enter this place everyone was smiling happy, drinks are a bit pricy at around £10 a cocktail though so not a cheap place to have a good drink and not the best at making cocktails either the consistency was very poor drinks tasted different every time even though I ordered the same drink.

But all that being said I would still recommend going for at least one drink here as the atmosphere is great.",April 2019,Bolivar Beach Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g642168-d7193390-Reviews-Bolivar_Beach_Bar-Alimos_Attica.html,"Alimos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Tourist trap,"Potentially could be a great experience but has been fine tuned to keep you on the cruise ship as long as possible clearly to keep you spending your money on there and drinks etc are not cheap!

As many others have stated you get very little time on the beautiful islands you visit as most of the day is spent travelling.

I also like many others would not recommend this cruise unless something dramatically changes about it.

If the cruise just cut out the hydra island you would have much more time on the others and would be much better.

You don’t even get enough time to sit and eat on the islands, you get off the boat and the locals are desperate for a bit of your cash trying to get you in the shops to buy magnets, key rings etc.

Don’t get me wrong if you like being on cruise ships then this is a cruise you can waste a day on if that’s how you like to spend your time..... but not for me.",April 2019,Hydraiki Athens One Day Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2716449-Reviews-Hydraiki_Athens_One_Day_Cruise-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,1.0,3.5

Amazing all round,"What a wonderful experience We’ve dined in many countries but nothing can compare to the customer satisfaction here.

The food was great very tasty can’t be faulted in one way.

The service is what makes this place so great, staff are constantly making sure you are happy and satisfied in a very balanced manner not to disturb you too much.

So we approached the manager to congratulate the staff on the service and the manager praised the staff there and then which was lovely to see.

We was then gifted a complimentary drink from the manager... all I can say is wow
Such a great manager Nikos and experience for us. Not easy to put into words but was a next level experience. More than 5*",April 2019,TGI Fridays,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d983652-Reviews-TGI_Fridays-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Over popular leads to poor services,"Been here once before as a treat from my partner we had treatments and experience was good but you would expect to get what you pay for.

Decided to return this month and unfortunately didn’t even make it through the door, phoned earlier in the week to check that we could just walk in was told by the staff on the phone we didn’t need to book this time so we trusted them. Obviously demand is too high and service has fallen.

After a 2hr journey to bath and paying steeply for parking we arrived outside to be greeted by a 2hr que outside the door in harsh wind and cold. We stood in the que for 30 mins I was hoping it would move quickly but it didn’t, the fast track £20 extra charge wasn’t even available so we left to drive home again before we got I’ll as weather was bad.

Thank you for wasting my Sunday and £60 in fuel In the future if you could be honest with customers when they call in advance that they may have to wait outside for 2hrs in the wind,rain and cold rather than falsely advising people that you could just turn up on the day and gain almost instant entry.

Gone from excellent rating to terrible such a shame.",March 2019,Thermae Bath Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186370-d269514-Reviews-Thermae_Bath_Spa-Bath_Somerset_England.html,"Bath, United Kingdom",attractions,1.0,4.0
Day spa,"What a lovely place.
We came across this place on trip advisor and thought we would give it a try. We phoned first to see if they allow walk in without a booking which they do.
Upon arrival was greeted very nicely by the hotel staff who kindly directed us to the spa, again nicely greeted by spa staff and showed around the spa.
the facilities were all very clean the quality of everything was very high, it was a very nice experience very well maintained.
Only thing I could fault which was not a big deal is the jacuzzi was on a timer 10 mins on a 5 off rather than customer controlled, other than that a great experience, pool was warm and clean.
It worked perfectly I felt relaxed and was able to unwind.
I cannot comment on treatments I would advise booking those in advance prices are on the higher side for massage so I’m hopeful that they will be as good as the spa was when I return again.

"Avoid, avoid, avoid","Where to start,
Didn’t book was a pop in visit restaurant was very quiet so got sat down instantly,
Went to the bar to order a roast beef was told that it had run out it was late in the day so chose roast turkey instead, was then told the turkey was not available it was replaced with chicken for the day so I asked if the was an adjustment in price and the person serving laughed, I responded but saying it was a serious question and they said they would check with the manager to which the manager came out from the back and peered at me and my partner from around the corner (strange behaviour). The person serving returned and offered some discount on the change in meat.
When the main turned up it was the smallest piece of chicken breast (not carved roast chicken) I have ever seen, I believe I was punished for asking for price adjustment, not only was the chicken small the Yorkshire puddings were raw, and everything tasted microwaved not roasted.
We both left the whole meal and left the restaurant.
I didn’t bother complaining they already had the payment before we ate they would be nothing to achieve apart from causing a scene.",March 2019,The Star Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190745-d1553009-Reviews-The_Star_Inn-Newbury_Berkshire_England.html,"Newbury, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,3.5
As bad as the reviews,"We stopped here for convenience and really should of checked the reviews before had! The place was almost empty at peak time on a Saturday night which says it all.
Everything is as bad as stated in all the bad reviews.
Poor service, poor food potion size,poor presentation, over priced for sizes.
In my opinion would have been much more satisfied going to the McDonald’s 30 seconds from here!
Personally I believe this restaurant is on its last legs and will be closed down in the near future!
Hopefully they can get some decent management in to turn this place around!",July 2018,Little Frankies,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187054-d1986738-Reviews-Little_Frankies-Basingstoke_Hampshire_England.html,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,2.5
Slightly disappointed,"After reading many great reviews of this place my partner decided to treat me to a late birthday dinner,
Arrived and was greeted nicely by staff and made to feel welcome.
Was a Friday evening and I expected it to be busy but it was quite quiet so was able to relax a bit more and not shout over a noisy room which was nice!
Ordered some olives and garlic chibatta to start with came out promptly and nicely presented also taste as good as it looked, for mains we had the steak and chips and chicken burger and chips.
Chicken burger was a bit dry if I’m honest and could only taste the chargrilled/ burnt flavour unfortunately but the chips were very nicely done!
The steak was quite fatty/greasy they only had rib-eye and sirloin on offer so if your looking for a nice fillet unfortunately not available here!
Good ales available so was pleased about that.. all round not a bad experience but did have a little higher expectations based on reviews and price of meals.
None the less not a bad place just not quite as good as I’d hoped.",June 2018,The Hogget,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503834-d1629048-Reviews-The_Hogget-Hook_Hampshire_England.html,"Hook, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Dreadfully run,"Popped in for a drink before our film at the cinema, stood at the bar for 20 mins didn’t get served! Not particularly busy just staff looked like they was on holiday everything in slow motion!
Definitely would not recommend this establishment!!!",June 2018,The Angel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187054-d10431886-Reviews-The_Angel-Basingstoke_Hampshire_England.html,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,3.0
Birthday celebration,"Firstly I would start by saying that I did have trouble parking here, being a Sunday and great weather was very busy car park and struggled for about 20 mins to park.

As for the food and service was very good, friendly staff, most of our party had the roast dinners all were great and heard no complaints!

The restaurant catered for our large group quite well at a very busy time so, I can’t fault them on that.

Personally the only bad point for me was the fact they didnt really have much in the way of chocolate deserts, I found this strange as it’s normally the most popular.

The outside area is beautiful and there was even some swings for the kids to play on, lovely place on a sunny day.",May 2018,The Mill House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2642664-d1804626-Reviews-The_Mill_House-North_Warnborough_Hook_Hampshire_England.html,"North Warnborough, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Family Sunday roast,"We had a table for 8 people booked in advance as we wanted peak time on a Sunday!
arrived and was greeted nicely by the staff.
Service was good staff were friendly and keen to please!
Food was of a good standard nicely presented and tasty on all the dishes that we chose (mainly roasts).
Pudding choices were also good plenty of variety.
I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good food,atmosphere and good service.
Also has a nice garden with a small play area for children.
You can also bring your dog here if you wish.",May 2018,The Falcon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1096798-d2031599-Reviews-The_Falcon-Rotherwick_Hook_Hampshire_England.html,"Rotherwick, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Disappointing,"I have visited this restaurant many times previously and has always been very good but on this recent occasion I unfortunately don’t have much good to say about it,
We had a 3 corse meal for 2 people which come to around £60 odd with drinks.
I annoyed me that you don’t get any service with this it’s very basic service you have to seat yourself and order your food at the bar! I personally think no restaurant should do this.
Food came out I ordered the steak medium and it came out rare, no customer service again to ask if I was happy with the meal and there was a que at the bar so complaining would of taken so long it wasn’t worth it. And just had to leave it!
Summary is you’d be safer with a take away from anywhere at less expense and probably better service.
Shame that the new management has let such a lovely restaurant go down hill used to be very nice.",May 2018,Longbridge Mill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2642703-d1646011-Reviews-Longbridge_Mill-Sherfield_On_Loddon_Hampshire_England.html,"Sherfield On Loddon, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Just not good enough,"To start with my outward bound flight was on time, this was my first time flying with this airline during boarding of this plane I began to realise just how budget it is! the seats were basically park bench with a very thin cushion and an armrest extremely uncomfortable and cramped conditions I guess due to the fact it’s short European flights they try get as many people as they can on the plane.
So I’m sat on this flight in my very uncomfortable seat thinking ok it’s a short flight I will have something to eat and drink to distract me from the discomfort and then the food/snack service starts to make its way down the aisle I was sat mid plane and but the time the trolly reached me they had ran out of all the items that I wanted so clearly only catering for 1/3 of the plane.
On the return flight it was delayed no explanation as to why just waiting around for 1.5hrs.
the same plane journey experience again where not enough food on plane for the amount of people wanting it....and due to being late the pilot had to rush the flight with a very uncomfortable hard landing and descent which really hurts my ears. Very little in the way of apology for all the inconvenience caused to passengers.
If I’m honest I personally would not recommend this airline and I will not be flying with them again.
Also just to add hand luggage were moved from the storage during the flight and stuffed into another further down the plane I was unaware of this until I reached the destination so I would say that your luggage is safe either.",April 2018,Vueling Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729185-Reviews-Vueling-Airlines,World,flights,1.0,2.5
Friendly and accommodating,"Was my second visit to this bar/restaurant and for the second time was very happy with the experience!
We turned up with no booking at peak time on Sunday it was very busy but the staff were helpful and got us seated.
Food was lovely again I can’t fault this restaurant if you like a country style with real warm fire and great atmosphere this is the place to go and all the staff are very polite and very welcoming.",April 2018,The Elm Tree,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186299-d2515465-Reviews-The_Elm_Tree-Southampton_Hampshire_England.html,"Southampton, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Very cool,"Been to a few aquariums in my time in different countries but this one was great lots of wows from kids and adults around and it is a nicely designed inside it cost €20 per adult on the day but I could imagine with the species and tanks they have would take a lot of maintenance and looking after so price is justified really!
Can’t comment on food and drinks quality or prices as didn’t have any whilst I was there only downside I could say as there didn’t seem to be any talks or shows/feeding during my visit so we did seem to get through it quite quickly.
Definitely recommend to families with children sharks were right up close and overhead at points.",April 2018,L’Aquarium de Barcelona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d195124-Reviews-L_Aquarium_de_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,4.0,3.5
Has potential,"Positives
Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights booked the “junior suite” room was nicely designed had a jacuzzi style bath that comfortably fit 2 people had a separate large shower room with powerful shower, room size was nice with sofa and chairs and very large bed.
The room also has good gadgets usb charge sockets, multi charger for all phones and pda provided to browse internet for things to do and discounts for local attractions. View was stunning from 8th floor provided the weather was good.
Iron and ironing board and safe was included in price for room also (not extra)

Negatives
Various switches and general upkeep of the room was poor, floors were a bit dusty door surrounds near bath swollen and damaged by water previously. power setting for bath jets not working so full power only.
And being British this annoyed me the most room had tea/coffee cups and kettle but no tea, coffee sugar supplied I believe this was done purposely to get you to buy the €17 breakfast they offer on ground floor.

Overall nice stay but hotel just needs to tweak a few things in my opinion was close to being a solid European 4*",April 2018,Hotel Catalonia Barcelona 505,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d228572-Reviews-Hotel_Catalonia_Barcelona_505-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.0
Great for a picknic,"Enjoyed the gardens and I would say the free part of this park is more interesting than the payable part! Didn’t understand why part of it was queuing and waiting times to see in my opinion things much of the same.
regardless was still and nice place to visit and grounds were clean and well kept so even though it was run in a strange way I would still say it’s worth the entrance fee.
I would say it’s a nice place to take a picknic and enjoy a nice lunch with some great views of Barcelona.",April 2018,Parc Guell,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190624-Reviews-Parc_Guell-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,3.0,4.0
Pleasant surprise,"Looking for some dinner in Barcelona can across this restaurant and thought we would try it, food turned up hot and nicely presented tasted more than satisfactory, desert was fantastic I have a sweet tooth and found plenty to choose from.

Overrated,"Hotel is quite nice looking, outside appearance is clean and tidy.
I choose half board which was breakfast and dinner, food was reasonable quality but ruined by buffet style and queues allowing food to go cold quickly.
Poor restocking of popular drinks had to leave hotel and seek breakfast outside as stock was low, when speaking to manager was refused any compensation and was told I could just choose something else... Wow not what you'd expect from a 4 star hotel.
No drink included with dinner there are many hidden extra cost with this hotel.
Dirty towels had been left in room for days.
Walls are quite thin was woken up early most days by road noise and conversation by people in next room.
I personally would not class this as 4 star hotel I would put it as 3 star a 4 star prices.
Also just to finish wifi is shockingly poor.",September 2016,Barcelo Corralejo Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580322-d678447-Reviews-Barcelo_Corralejo_Bay-Corralejo_La_Oliva_Fuerteventura_Canary_Islands.html,"Fuerteventura, Spain",hotels,2.0,4.5
Basic and below advertised standard,"When searching for my holiday this place came up as a 4* price reflected 4* all inclusive! upon arrival I went to check in and was told the all the bungalows by the pool were full (this is what I paid for!) so I then had to stay my first day in a different room! When complaining to reception there attitude was terrible and couldn't really care less! Everything advertised is not included in the price, tv is extra wifi is extortionate! kettle ect all cost extra so cannot for the life of me understand how this place has a four star award! Very unimpressed if I wanted basic I would of paid for basic! You are kicked out of you room on day of departure regardless of if you flight leaves late that night!
