worst decision,"We were walking around Lucerne and saw this asian restaurant selling Ramen and other kind of dishes. It was by far our worst decision! It was instant ramen, Shin Ramen to be precise. And to make it even funnier it costs us 13.- p.p. Shin Ramen can be bought in any supermarket here in Switzerland for about 2CHF. I can only talk about the Ramen dish the other dishes might be better. The cashier couldn’t talk in German and her English wasn’t good as well. She had a hard time to understand us.",June 2019,Mashida,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188064-d8857227-Reviews-Mashida-Lucerne.html,"Lucerne, Switzerland",restaurants,1.0,3.5
good place,"Went to Domodossola for a day trip and we didnt look up any places to eat as we wanted to surprise ourselves. This restaurant has many different Pizzas and dishes to offer. The portion is really huge also delicious! Friendly staff even though they couldnt really understand English but a little German. I can highly recommend this place! For one anti pasti, 3 main dishes and drinks (soft drink and coffee) we paid under 50$ which is in my opinion such a good price for the good quality",January 2019,Terminus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g681250-d1821095-Reviews-Terminus-Domodossola_Province_of_Verbano_Cusio_Ossola_Piedmont.html,"Domodossola, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.0
shopping and food,Dam Square has many things to offer from clothing shops to fancy restaurants. They have expensive brands and more affordable prices like Primark. It is a very good spot if you want to go shopping and eat a lot of food. There are some street performers and a lot of pigeons around. Be careful of pickpockets bc it gets really crowded.,July 2018,Dam Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d189381-Reviews-Dam_Square-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,4.0,4.0
relaxing,Vondelpark is close (15mins) to the Rijks Museum. You can get there by tram or walk. The park is huge and there are good spots to take pictures.

disappointing,i would not recommend going to the little mermaid bc first of all it is not close to central station or nyhaven. it's just crowded and there is not a special history behind the mermaid. if you have a lot of time in copenhagen drive by and take a picture. it is easy to get there by bike though,July 2018,The Little Mermaid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189541-d245024-Reviews-The_Little_Mermaid-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",attractions,1.0,3.5
delicious,the korean food there was delicious! it pricey though but worth the money. they have many different dishes to offer from instant noodles to korean fried chicken. we didn't have to wait too long for the food and the atmosphere was great. they played kpop which made it more like a korean spot and there were many korean celebrity posters. would recommend to make reservations since it was quite full during dinner time.,July 2018,SSAM Korean Food Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189541-d12562722-Reviews-SSAM_Korean_Food_Bar-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",restaurants,4.0,4.5

high expectations,when you hear Paris you think about the Eiffel Tower. lower your expectations bc it is not that special and it does not look nice at all if you go up close. there are many people around it and street vender. from the distance you can get nice photos with the Eiffel Tower in the background.,July 2018,Eiffel Tower,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188151-Reviews-Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,2.0,4.5

beautiful sunset/sunrise view,"If you want to get a good view from the city and barcode I highly recommend to go the Opera. It is very close to the Central Station.

huge museum,usually I'm not a type of person who would go into a museum however I really enjoyed it. there are many things to see and to learn. it was very interesting! if you go there plan about 2.5-3h bc there is a lot to see and the museum is quite big. right in front of the museum there is the I Amsterdam sign and there is a park close by.

nice station,"the station looks very good and clean. there are many staff members to ask if you have any question or don't know the direction (normal hours idk if they are available at night too). one thing i really like about this station is that there are different restaurants even though i think the food is a little pricey there you have many options. also the supermarket (to go) offers fresh food and has good opening hours for early and late travellers. if you want to shop a little there are also good clothing, make up and souvenir shops for last minute gifts.",July 2018,Centraal Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190573-Reviews-Centraal_Station-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,4.0,4.5
passing by,"i really didn't know what to expect there..my cousin and I thought we should go to the redlight district since it is so well known in Amsterdam.

awful - do not recommend,"our group has been traveling for some time and stayed at different hostels. Anker is so far the worst hostel we’ve been to! You have to rent linen and buy for every single thing you want to use. We don’t even have lockers in our room which is very inconvenient. The bathroom is very small for 6 people and everything gets wet bc the shower and toilet are in the same room. Room was not clean when we arrived, stains all over the place and oven was dirty (fat, pizza crumble..idk)! I’m not sure if the room was cleaned after the group before us...even hand soap was empty. Staff were not really friendly and didn’t tell us anything about the hostel or what they have to offer unlike the other hostels. Luckily we are only staying for 2 nights..I really do not recommend this hostel at all!!!!",July 2018,Anker Hostel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190479-d593547-Reviews-Anker_Hostel-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,"Oslo, Norway",hotels,1.0,3.0
good place to stay for a short time,"at first we were quite disappointed bc our room (private for 6 travelers) was small and stuffy. However, compared to another hostel CBP was great! They had so many freebies which js very good and makes up the price you pay for the linen you have to rent. The location is very close to metro and bus station. As a group of 6 people we got a quite small room and our bathroom was waaaaay to tiny. Sink was not even big enough to wash your face w/o splashing water everywhere. Also we were right next to the street which meant that we could not open the windows at night. It was too risky and dangerous to keep the windows open. Other than that I dont have anything else to say. You have a great kitchen, free laundry and dryer, free pasta and more..maybe the other rooms were a little bigger nevertheless we had a good stay in Stockholm! Thanks CBP",July 2018,City Backpackers Hostel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189852-d237673-Reviews-City_Backpackers_Hostel-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",hotels,3.0,4.5
small portions,"For our little student gathering (7 people) it was a quite crowded. The place is really close to the Zurich main station and also they made it look cozy. Food and service was good and friendly. The portions were in comparison to other places pretty small for example the shrimp taco. That's why I think it was pricey for the small portions. If they gave us bigger portions we wouldn't complain about the price. It's good to have a snack as a student but to fill our stomach it was expensive. However, we all liked to place and staff a lot.",February 2018,El Luchador,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188113-d3245546-Reviews-El_Luchador-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",restaurants,3.0,4.0
delicious,"At the beginning it was a little bit confusing because they told us to wait until they find us a table even though we made reservations. However, the staff was very nice and friendly.

first recommendation to my friends and family,"I've been to Vietnam couple times and only with Singapore airlines I'm satisfied. First of all booking the flight online is very simple and the informations are clear und understandable. Secondly the flight attendants are helpful and friendly. Even with simple request they were able to help and came right away when I needed them. Even though I am very picky with my food and do not like airplane food I find Singapore Airlines food enjoyable. They serve it pretty warm and the menu is quite various and have quite a big selection of snacks. Last but not least Singapore Airlines entertainment on the plane is huge. Old and new movies for young and old, from classic to pop music and good games to play. The flight (12h) went by pretty quickly because the entertainment was good. In my opinion is the entertainment important when you do not want to work or sleep on the plane or else it feels like forever. One thing that I do not like are the seats. Even though I am small I think the seats could be a little bit bigger and more leg space would be nice. Nevertheless, I am very satisfied with Singapore Airlines and would recommend it to anyone who wants to fly to Vietnam!",July 2017,Singapore Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729151-Reviews-Singapore-Airlines,World,flights,5.0,4.5
Gathering,"My friends and I (students) would meet once a month. We wanted to find a good place with a mid-range price to eat and have a good time. We went there a few times before just to drink coffee and having a dessert but this time we thought we came to eat lunch. My friend made a reservation and everything went smoothly. Everyone in there stared at us bc we are much younger. Which was a bit strange but we didnt really mind. Service was quite fast at the beginning but we had to wait for some time to finally get our food. It was crowded at lunch time. The main food was delicious and for the price we had to pay good. However, we were disappointed when we ordered chocolate mousse but got hard(!) ice cream instead. The service lady after lunch was a little bit unfriendly. We stayed for some time and had a long chat and it was a good place to stay in and talk and just have a good time over lunch. The service could be friendlier! But we all agreed that the food was great.",November 2017,Wirtshaus Wilder Mann,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g652158-d3360460-Reviews-Wirtshaus_Wilder_Mann-Sursee.html,"Sursee, Switzerland",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Definitely coming back,"Even though the price is a bit more expensive (for broke students) it was worth it. The online reservation went well. It was quite packed around lunch time but around 2pm it was very empty during a weekday(Friday). It was hard to choose bc the menu is huge and everything seems to be good. There are many dishes like pasta, penne, pizza, steak and much more. It took quite some time for the food to arrive but it was very very delicious and we enjoyed it very much. After lunch we stayed in until noon and had drinks and enjoyed our time there. The staff was very friendly and even though it looked stressful they stayed calm and did everything pretty good. We are definitely going back!",December 2017,Pizzeria Restaurant Schweizerheim,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g652158-d5018098-Reviews-Pizzeria_Restaurant_Schweizerheim-Sursee.html,"Sursee, Switzerland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great pizza,For my friends birthday we went there so eat lunch. She is a very big pizza fan and she liked it a lot. As for me and other 3 friends we enjoyed the pizza as well! The staff was very friendly. We ordered a pizza for a friend who supposed to come 30mins later after that the pizza went cold and the staff offered my friend a new pizza w/o paying extra. Which was very nice. Like other restaurants it was very packed during lunch time and we made reservation which was good idea. The price for the pizza was reasonable. The place is not very easy to find when you dont life in Sursee or knows more about Sursee. Overall it was a very good place to eat and have a good time,September 2017,Altstadt-Pizzeria Zur Muhle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g652158-d4932272-Reviews-Altstadt_Pizzeria_Zur_Muhle-Sursee.html,"Sursee, Switzerland",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Totally worth a visit,After the Jesus Statue we drove to the lighthouse and the view on the way to th3 lighthouse was amazing. Even when you reach the top the view will still amaze you. But a huge mistake that we made was going there during lunch time when it was crazy sunny and hot. However it was worth the heat because we took amazing pictures.,July 2017,Vung Tau Lighthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303946-d8464294-Reviews-Vung_Tau_Lighthouse-Vung_Tau_Ba_Ria_Vung_Tau_Province.html,"Vung Tau, Vietnam",attractions,4.0,4.0
Was okay,We expected more..the park and the way to the waterfall was made really nice but you will see a lot of trash and stuff. We went to buy nuoc mia (sugarcane drink) and they said it was very clean and when I pointed out what was not clean (I'm vietnamese) they were sooo mad at me lol but tbh it's not worth it,July 2017,Phu Quoc Waterfall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g5556278-d5512881-Reviews-Phu_Quoc_Waterfall-Ham_Ninh_Phu_Quoc_Island_Kien_Giang_Province.html,"Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam",attractions,3.0,3.5
Not bad,We were craving rice so we came there to eat. During lunch or dinner time the restaurant is really crowded so you might consider going a little before or after that time. Thats why we had under cooked rice the first time we came. The side dishes were delicious and the service was quite fast too. Therefore if you are craving rice this is a really good spot.,July 2017,Com Bac 123 Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1184679-d9982882-Reviews-Com_Bac_123_Restaurant-Duong_Dong_Phu_Quoc_Island_Kien_Giang_Province.html,"Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Worth a visit,If you are in Phu Quoc you should visit the prison. Why? Because it is about Phu Quocs history that's why I think it is worth a visit.

Not clean,"Location for this hotel is pretty good. It is close to the airport and city center. On the opposite side of the hotel there are many shops to rent car (for a day) or motorbikes.
At first the price seems okay but the rooms were not clean when we checked in. Hair on the floor, dirty mirror, dirt on the towel, hair in the sink..and even more. Therefore the price was okay but it was not clean at all. The beds were loud and not soft at all also it was still wet.
Since we knew how to speak vietnamese it waa easy to communicate with the staff and owner but when it came to fill out our documents they had some issues.
Since the hotel isn't the newest anymore the doors are hard to close and the walls dirty and really disgusting.",July 2017,Tai Phong Tien Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1184676-d2039295-Reviews-Tai_Phong_Tien_Hotel-Duong_To_Phu_Quoc_Island_Kien_Giang_Province.html,"Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam",hotels,1.0,3.0
Clean and beautiful,In comparison to the other beaches this one was one of the cleanest. It was very quiet because it was faraway from the city and resorts. Due to the weather it was dangerous to swim or go into the water because the waves were very strong.

Amazing night view,The drinks and food were really really expensive but it's totally worth it for the view. It was kinda hard to get there because you have to go to the first floor to get in but the staff members told us to go down and then up again. So that was confusing since there is no sign like: sky bar or idk.
