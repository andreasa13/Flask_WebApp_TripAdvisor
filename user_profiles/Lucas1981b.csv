Delicious food,"I can say the food was very good , but me and my wife were there for couple of hours we enjoy each other , but the service was not kind specially the waiter ( wine advisor) he had an ironic face with the waiters and that made a bad ambience. I was in the second floor but it was so much noizy from the plates .something very important the waiters should be taking care of them self’s dress proper and fix their hairs , and unfortunately I don’t want to be rude but the waiter manager was smelling really bad every time he pass by us.
