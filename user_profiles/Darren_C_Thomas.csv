Fantastic Private Tour of Gallipoli,"My family and I choose to do a private day tour of Gallipoli through Gallipoli Tour (tour run by Crowded House) and were not disappointed.

When we arrived we we met our tour guide Hussein and were taken to great local restaurant for lunch. From there Hussein proceeded to guide us around the main sites of Gallipoli, taking time to answer my kids endless questions and also allowing us plenty of time to explore each site and memorial.

Truly Magnificent,"The Hagia Sophia is one of the most significant buildings in world and an absolute architectural marvel. Built in 360 AD, it served as an Eastern Orthodox Cathedral at the height of the late Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire, was turned into a Catholic Church during the 4th Crusade before being converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest on Constantinople and finally in 1931 was turned into a museum by Ataturk. The dome was the largest in the world for almost 1,000 years and served as an inspiration to both Christian and Islamic architecture that followed. Elements of the history of the Hagia Sophia can be viewed today from the beautiful Byzantine mosaics through to the mihrab, minarets and beautiful calligraphy on the dome that marks its time as a mosque. The building is highly accessible with ramps instead of stairs up to the 2nd level gallery (note that they can be somewhat slippery). It is worth also having a pre-purchased ticket in order to skip the permanently present queue. A must whilst in Istanbul

One of the Finest Museum/Art Galleries in the World,"The Vatican Museum houses one of the single greatest collections of any museum or art gallery in the world. The museum is divided into different sub-museums covering named after the Pope who created them covering human history from the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans right up to the modern day. There are just too many master pieces to list here, but this museum is so much more than just the Sistine Chapel. Some of the must sees include Stanze di Raffaello (Raphael's rooms), Rodin's the thinker, Bellini's Pieta, Caravaggio's Entombment, the Egyptian mummies, the gallery of maps and so on. There are a few things to note - definitely pre-purchase your ticket to skip the line as the queues are horrendous if you do not. The halls that make up the museum are not that wide and with the very high number of tour groups even before 9am in the morning can make seeing things difficult. Study the map of the museum and have a plan before you go! With 20,000+ artefacts and paintings on display, it is easy to miss something.

One of the Best Examples of Baroque Architecture,Piazza Navona is a true master piece of the Renaissance with some of the best Baroque Architecture found anywhere in Rome.

Might and Magnificence of Rome,"Despite being ravaged by barbarians, later civilisations and earthquakes, the Colossum remains one of the greatest of all Roman monuments and an absolutely quintessential attraction to visit when in Rome.

Worth taking the time to visit when visiting the Leaning Tower,The Duomo is quite a magnificent building and worth taking the time to view when visiting the Leaning Tower.

"Beautiful little church, shame it wasn't open",We visited Pisa on a Thursday and discovered this charming little church right on the banks for the Arno.
