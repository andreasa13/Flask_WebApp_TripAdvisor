Por accessibility for people with mobility issues,I have called in advance and was told that I would be provided with a wheelchair but when I arrived at the location I was denied one and had to use my crutches which is difficult and painful to do on the terrain . I was at least allowed to use the lift.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5
