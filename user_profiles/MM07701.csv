Best Pizza Ever!,"Ever since moving here 6 years ago, I have been searching for pizza I enjoy as much as my favorite place in Northern New Jersey. I finally found it! If it wasn't for DoorDash, I would not have thought you delivered to Red Bank from Long Branch. Pizza was still warm! (and I didn't even need to add toppings.... the plain pizza was so delicious!) Can't wait to order again!",May 2020,Cafe Villa Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46913-d4617597-Reviews-Cafe_Villa_Pizza-West_Long_Branch_New_Jersey.html,"West Long Branch, New Jersey",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Not a fan,"Stopped by New Monmouth Diner to get a late lunch to go. Ordered the scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, white toast, side order of crisp bacon and silver dollar pancakes.
Since I ordered it to go, I didn't get a chance to check the order until I was home which was a 15 minute drive back to Red Bank.

They forgot the bacon, so now I've paid for this item in cash and my lunch would be ruined if I got back into my car to pick it up. Everything would have been cold by the time I went back and got this order. Since I paid cash, I didn't even call them since there's nothing they could do because I paid cash. I even tipped the waitress 20% on a ""to go"" order which was incomplete.

Food was average, hash browns were way too large and either not fully cooked or overdone. Eggs were done well and toast wast burnt on the crust.

Pancakes were not very good compared to other breakfast restaurants.

Service couldn't have been nicer but very disappointed in the actual meal and probably won't go back there again.",February 2020,New Monmouth Diner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46619-d4918869-Reviews-New_Monmouth_Diner-Middletown_New_Jersey.html,"Middletown, New Jersey",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Perkins is not what it used to be,"I always get eggs benedict from Perkins. I will go alone if I have a craving. This is the 2nd Perkins in Monmouth County that I have been to that has changed the original ingredients of Eggs Benedict. The shredded hash browns did not disappoint and the pancake I ordered was cooked very well. But the Eggs Benedict was so disappointing. Usually it's made with a slice of ham about 1/4 inch think slice. The dish they served had thin, paper like slices of ham like you'd get in a deli piled under the egg. And they drowned the dish in hollandaise sauce. So much that it made the entire dish mushy by the time I got to my 2nd egg. I was very disappointed and probably won't go back there. Last time I was there they put pork roll on the dish and that worked great! I was so looking forward to this one dish.",January 2020,Perkins Restaurant & Bakery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46501-d4066269-Reviews-Perkins_Restaurant_Bakery-Hazlet_New_Jersey.html,"Hazlet, New Jersey",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Awesome Hibachi!,I usually order the shrimp hibachi with clear soup. Love the flavoring and friend rice. The cold noodles are excellent! I order a lot through Door Dash and it's always hot and packaged well. Love how close this is in Fair haven if I want to dine at the restaurant. Fair priced as well.,January 2020,Sansu Japanese Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46429-d4538782-Reviews-Sansu_Japanese_Steakhouse-Fair_Haven_New_Jersey.html,"Fair Haven, New Jersey",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good Chinese Buffet,Decent variety but high costs for average quality of food. Food to go is based on weight.

Horrible Airlines,"Will NEVER fly this airline again. The seats are way too small and there is no legroom at all. The food trays are either broken or they shoved into your stomach. They told me I could bring a blow up ottoman and then after I blew it up, they told me I could not use it. But not he way home another woman had one blown up and they did not tell her she couldn't use it. Food it horrible and staff is too busy talking to each other rather than tend to anyone's needs.

Horror Fight!,This must have been the oldest plan I have ever flown on. The seats had not cushion left in them. The place smelled. The food tray was broken and had to lay on my lap to so I could put my food on it. I needed to sleep on the plane so I could get to France and start working right away but the seats do not lay flat and you feel like you are sliding down them so I did not get one wink of sleep.

United Airlines to Turks and Caicos,"Love United! I usually never have issues with this airline. I'm not jammed into the seats and there actually is leg room.

"Great Food, Great View of the Water... Must have reservations!",Just love going to Salt Creek. Food is always spectacular and the service is always A+. A must have is the garlic bread. They used to automatically place this on everyone's table but now you have to request it and pay a small amount for it. I would definitely recommend saving enough room for the Chocolate Ganache Souffl√©. You have to order it when you order dinner since it takes 25 minutes to prepare. It's the best I've ever had (add vanilla ice cream),November 2019,Salt Creek Grille - Rumson,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46794-d1315334-Reviews-Salt_Creek_Grille_Rumson-Rumson_New_Jersey.html,"Rumson, New Jersey",restaurants,5.0,4.0
