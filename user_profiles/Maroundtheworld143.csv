It has revamping, cleansing, healing and appeasing effects. Ziani is a great hammam with all old experienced ladies giving you bath. Total package is 350 DHS. You can always alter it. It starts with rubbing morrcan black soap in the sauna for about 20 minutes. Then a lady will scrub your body for approximately 15 minutes. Then comes the sea weed wrap 15 minutes followed by oil massage and polishing 20 minuets. The entire process takes around 90 minutes. The hammam left me relaxed and enhanced the blood circulation. The bath helps to get rid of impurities from the skin, such as elasticity, clarity and eliminates dead skin layers. It reduces stress, anxiety, and deep relaxation physically and emotionally.I would highly recommend Moroccan hammam.",September 2019,Hammam Ziani,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293732-d2192796-Reviews-Hammam_Ziani-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat.html,"Casablanca, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.5
