Good eating places,Honestly it is interesting for the food and the ambience. Otherwise touristy shops which are very boring.,April 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Best thing about Athens,This is a very impressive museum and inexpensive too. We spent hours here. Congratulations to the Greeks for this one.,April 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
You have to do it but honestly it is a bit of a disappointment.,The acropolis museum is very impressive and should not be missed. The Acropolis is kind of underwhelming when you learn that it was all destroyed and they are trying to resurrect it.,April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Glad we did it but it could have been so much better.,"The bus tour started very well with George as our guide. George is a learned man who gave intelligent commentary the whole way. He is a treasure. After Delphi, George left us , the bus got full and it went down hill. Next guide not a patch on George. We paid for upgraded accommodation and it was very good. I don’t understand why my husband and I were stuck in the back of the bus over the wheel for two days when other people got to hog two seats or others got the front of the bus the whole time. I talked to the guide about the fairness of this but he was just rude. The visit to the Meteora was not made special by our guide or the number of people he was dragging around. I guess this is the nature of the big bus trip. We don’t normally travel like this. There are long periods on the bus. Toilet stops take half an hour not ten minutes. Next time I would do a small group tour.",April 2019,Delphi & Meteora Two Days Tour from Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d16722347-Delphi_Meteora_Two_Days_Tour_from_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,2.0,4.0

"Thanks Valentina, it was great.",An excellent walking tour. Valentina was very informative and helpful and caring. We wouldn’t have found these places ourselves so we find these walking tours a very helpful intro to a city.,March 2019,Generation Tours Barcelona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d7162336-Reviews-Generation_Tours_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,5.0,5.0
Thank you Igor for a great day,"This trip,was better than expected. Our guide Igor was very good, we have a lovely group of people and the vehicle was comfortable and we covered a lot of territory.

Thanks Josh,The tour was a good way to get a good overview of San Fran in a short time. We were only in the city for a day and a half and this was a good orientation to the interesting sites.,January 2019,Painted Ladies Tour Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d8131730-Reviews-Painted_Ladies_Tour_Company-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,5.0
Avoid this hotel,"We are staying here. Sadly there are winners and losers. We are losers. Some people get a nice pool view room and others like us get a room at the back of the building with a view of nothing, no robes and get to feel like we are backpackers.
We asked our travel agent for 4 star hotels and we have got a two star room in the dungeon. It gets worse, we are booked here for four nights.
Be very wary of this hotel they pride themselves on every room being unique, this just means you can get to be very unlucky.",February 2018,Villa Maydou,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295415-d642635-Reviews-Villa_Maydou-Luang_Prabang_Luang_Prabang_Province.html,"Luang Prabang, Laos",hotels,1.0,4.5
