Where democratic history is made,"It is amazing how they build this in their time without the machines we know today. The sculptures are an example of craftsmanship that today would cost so much almost nobody can effort it.
The moment I visited the Acropolis it was very crowded but still managed to look and enjoy the place",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Amazing Grilled food,"The menu has great choices of greek specialties and on the chalk board you can see the daily offers. Some of us even entered the kitchen to see what they had to offer of fresh fish.
You can watch how the lady in the kitchen is preparing the ordered food on the grill and taste it just a few moments later on your plate, just amazing how she does it.",October 2016,Aphrodite Grill & Seafood Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g8290440-d8353466-Reviews-Aphrodite_Grill_Seafood_Restaurant-Pali_Nisiros_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Nisiros, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Not a ordinary cathedral,"I went up the cathedral tower (thru reservations only), but was unlucky because of the fog. The lady guide still did a great job to tell about the history of building the tower and why there is just one.
If you are in front of the main portal you get an amazing few and you need someone to explain the meaning of all the figures.
To get inside the cathedral (free to the Antwerp people, others have to pay a fee), you need to use a side portal.",June 2016,Cathedral of Our Lady,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188636-d242682-Reviews-Cathedral_of_Our_Lady-Antwerp_Antwerp_Province.html,"Antwerp, Belgium",attractions,4.0,4.5

Great breakfast place,"Almost everything is fresh made. Staff is very good. Things they don't have, they run to get it in the stores on the corners. You can watch the cook making pancakes and your desired eggs thru a window.",June 2015,Crepes on Columbus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d873371-Reviews-Crepes_on_Columbus-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
