Chill lunch vibes,"My mom and I had lunch and drinks here and had a great time. By the time we were finishing our meal it was getting busier. If you want good seats don‚Äôt come too late. Our server Andy was great, very precessional and polite. He gave us good recommendations! We would definitely come back!",February 2020,Potato Head Beach Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g469404-d2005895-Reviews-Potato_Head_Beach_Club-Seminyak_Kuta_District_Bali.html,"Seminyak, Indonesia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great value for our family stay,Awesome resort we stayed at while doing a day trip out to Fraser Island. All our rooms had king beds for my parents and aunt and uncle as well as my husband and I. The tv selection was fabulous to put on before bed. The resort staff were super friendly and accommodating. If we are in the area again we will definitely be back!,January 2020,Oaks Hervey Bay Resort and Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1573098-d631893-Reviews-Oaks_Hervey_Bay_Resort_and_Spa-Urangan_Hervey_Bay_Fraser_Coast_Queensland.html,"Urangan, Australia",hotels,5.0,4.5
A must see,You can‚Äôt come to Athens and not are the acropolis. Definitely worth a visit! Check out the museum as well!,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Quick friendly service,"My friend went since it was close to our Airbnb with no expectations. It was one of the better meals we‚Äôve had since being in Greece. The prices are good, food is awesome and came out quickly. I‚Äôd definitely recommend checking it out if your in the area and wanting some casual Greek eats.",October 2019,Kalamaki Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3135302-Reviews-Kalamaki_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful sunset but overpriced just okay food,"We made a reservation the day before to make sure we had a view of the sunset, which was awesome from our table. We ordered the seafood plater to share and it was just okay. It was definitely not worth $80 euros. The portions were small and for $80 euros we expected a seafood feast! In addition to this, be aware that they bring you bread without asking and charge you for it. We thought it was complementary, it wasn‚Äôt much but we thought it was a bit rude to just be added to the bill. I wouldn‚Äôt go back, it was one of the more expensive dinners we‚Äôve had and was not worth it. Save your money and go somewhere else or just go for a drink.",October 2019,1500 BC Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d1128061-Reviews-1500_BC_Restaurant-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Amazing dinner on the beach,My friend and I made a reservation and were given a table on the beach. It was awesome to feel the sand on your feet and have the view of the Aegean Sea as we ate. My friend had the stuffed chicken and I had the stuffed vegetables and they were both amazing. To commence the meal they brought us completely donuts and traditional Greek shots. Both were great! We had an awesome night and great dinner. We would highly recommend this place!,September 2019,Avli Tou Thodori,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g659660-d1791041-Reviews-Avli_Tou_Thodori-Platys_Gialos_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Bachelorette bubbly brunch,We had such an awesome brunch with our group of 10. We had the bottomless mimosas and our server Nadia replenished them as we finished each pitcher.

Relaxing and perfect spa day,What a perfect day! My friends and I booked a few hours at the spa. One of the best massages I‚Äôve ever had!

Don't make this priority,We had three and a half days in Naples so we bought a 48 hour pass thinking we could use it each afternoon after returning from day trips. Although we should've read the fine print... coming from Florence where this company offers trips every 15 mins here it's every 40 and ends so much earlier. We ended up doing each line once but because of timing couldn't get off because it was the last bus. The last bus was at 4:50! Way too early. Especially since there isn't much going on at night here. It was a let down for sure... and hardly any audio information that was interesting.,September 2017,"Hop on Hop Off Bus, Naples",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187785-d3317603-Reviews-Hop_on_Hop_Off_Bus_Naples-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",attractions,2.0,3.5
Authentic and worth the wait,When we arrived we got a number to wait for a table. After 15 minutes we were seated with another lovely couple. They took our orders fairly quickly and our food came out quick. The pizza was a huge portion and tasted great. Go early so you don't have to wait too long.,September 2017,L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d1235237-Reviews-L_Antica_Pizzeria_da_Michele-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.0
A different take on traditional pizza üçï,We went here based on the reviews and weren't disappointed. It was something different and authentic from Italy.

Amazing honeymoon!!!,"From the moment we got to our room we were pampered and taken care of! We upgraded to the preferred with a swim out and it was awesome. We enjoyed Caesars with actual Clamato juice and eggs Benedict daily! We only ate at the buffet once because we couldn't get enough of the fish tacos and other awesome options. The snorkelling from the resort was awesome too. Just be prepared for the possibility of families being around on the beach as its public. All good though they kept to themselves and we hardly noticed them. All the restaurants were good and amazing service!! We enjoyed a couples massage, dinner on the beach and breakfast in bed all complementary when it's your honeymoon. We've been to a number of Riu Palaces and other 5 star chains and secrets blows them out of the water. It was such a nice quiet romantic week, perfect for couples - honeymoons, anniversaries or just a much needed vacay. We will definitely be back!

Overall amazing experience -,"I stayed at the Fairmont Lake Louise with my boyfriend and wanted to share a nice dinner. We decided to splurge and have dinner here after it coming highly recommended by a family member. It definitely didn't dissapoint! Our server Jarrod was great, very personable, knowledgeable and friendly. We had a cheese fondue and instantly fell in love! For our main meal, I only eat seafood and they were able to make a fish broth and bring me seafood instead of meat without question. We were the last ones in the restaurant as we didn't want the experience to end. The waitor asked if we would like to have the desert brough up to the room. I must say what a romantic way to end the night. We had such a good time and it was definitely worth the expense. The only thing would be to ask for a table with a view.

He recommended wines that were exceptional with our fondue.",June 2014,The Walliser Stube,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154912-d710579-Reviews-The_Walliser_Stube-Lake_Louise_Banff_National_Park_Alberta.html,"Lake Louise, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
