MATES =EXTREME FUN,"Wow !! What an amazing place to play arcade games which you need tokens to play games (more you drink the more tokens you get) but not for beer pong, and foosball table are free. The food is expensive plus paying + is the service fee. But getting a few nibbles and then sharing it among your friends then it works out well. Service is really good and helpful oh and also check out the hour drinks 2 for 1 :D.",February 2020,Level Up,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d13592924-Reviews-Level_Up-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Fab location and so clean and tidy,So close to Ala Moana centre like 5 minutes. 2 minutes away from lagoon great for paddle boarding and laying in the sand.

WHAT A EXTREMELY HOT DAY !!! :O,This experience was different as I imagined it to be. I guess becasue when I went they had construction going on so most of my pictures had ladders and etc. I suggust to wear comfortable shoes becasue it is a bit of a climb and hot one. But apart from all of that it was amazing view from the top.,July 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5

Good time to get some proper sleep and food !,"We were in transit and our flight was the early morning so Emirates gave us a night to stay at this lovely hotel, it's not so far away from Dubai Airport as well. The food was amazing full buffet breakfast and comfy beds to sleep on after been on a plane for 30 hours. The staff was very friendly and helpful at late 3am, and we were a very large group of girls. Would go back and stay there!",December 2015,Copthorne Airport Hotel Dubai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d2331543-Reviews-Copthorne_Airport_Hotel_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,3.0
THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL 5 STAR HOTEL ! :),"I am so happy we stayed here, the staff were amazing coming from the airport when we were tired and hungry, which they picked us from the airport. Breakfast was including for us which was amazing so much to choose from. The room service we ordered was just yummy especially coming from the airport so late at night. Right next door to the hotel is Nowzone which is a 4 level mall but it's quite expensive you would rather go to the Ben Thang Market inside and the outside one. The pool and gym is great to! :D",July 2016,Hotel Nikko Saigon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293925-d2244762-Reviews-Hotel_Nikko_Saigon-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",hotels,5.0,4.5
My Morocco Experience,"I would definitely come back to stay here ! Because its in the centre of markets, food places, and very cheap to stay.

Good Memories :),"I don't know where to start..... It was an amazing experience going to visit the Mekong Delta, boat ride to the different Islands ( Unicorn, Coconut Island) tasting honey I got to hold a honey nest I suggest you do it if you aren't allergic they don't sting you!! coconut candy which was interesting to try it was very sweet and if you aren't to good with milk and other dairy products maybe don't try it, it might make your stomach all funny. When we were walking through the villages I must say it was very clean compared to most places I have been to. On one of the island, you get to ride a horse that was lots of fun !!
Thank you Typhoon Honey for the amazing experience and making us all laugh we will cherish all moments we had with you! :D",July 2016,Deluxe Group Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293925-d8263413-Reviews-Deluxe_Group_Tours-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,5.0
VERY SAD AND EXPERIENCE BUT INTERESTING,"My Family and I went with a tour guide but they had to wait in the van because they aren't allowed to come. But it was an amazing place to see the about the Vietnam between American, I got emotional to see the photos of people and what they did. But it shows only one side of the war. I suggest you go if you are in Vietnam!",July 2016,War Remnants Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293925-d311103-Reviews-War_Remnants_Museum-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,4.5
