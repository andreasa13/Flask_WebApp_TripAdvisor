Elegance awes all,"This is the Acropolis, after all -- beginning of the western tradition in art and urban design. Not much more to day. The restoration since our first visit -- fifteen years ago -- has highlighted the elegance and beauty of this place and these buildings. Leave time to linger and watch the sun change the buildings. It is a bit of a hike up, but we are over 75 years old, took our time and enjoyed the hike up, the splendid buildings and the easy walk down.
Go early to avoid the crowds (not so bad in February), and DO NOT get vouchers in advance which you have to trade in for actual tickets at someplace other than the Acropolis itself. If you are early, there is not much wait to get tickets at the entrance -- we walked right up to the ticket booth at 10 am on a Thursday in February.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Well Hidden - Well Worth Finding,"This is the place to get the very best versions of iconic Italian dishes. It is the neighborhood trattoria (or Osteria) you always want to know, but rarely (especially in Venice) find. The spaghetti with clams (vongole veraci) could not have been better -- pasta perfect; just the right amount of garlic; a hint of the smell and taste of the sea floating in the background. Same evaluation of the veal chop, liver and onions, ravioli and other pastas, vegetables. Old-style setting and dignified (not stuffy) service -- not at all stuffy or off-putting. The outside patio is quiet and comfortable. Price reasonable.

Stick with basics. Hard to find -- actually quite close to Rialto bridge, but down a small side street and under a semi-hidden underpass.

Great for a cappuccino with chocolate brioche in the morning or afternoon espresso. I only wish the staff were more friendly.

It's the Lions!,"The square is lovely, but it is the lions that make this special. There are at least 4 pairs on 4 sides -- and maybe another pair up high.

"Comfortable, Pretty, and Pretty Good","A pleasant, small piazza with plenty of room on the patio if the weather is right. In the Centro Storico and easy to find. Comfortable and relaxing -- we had dinner on the first day of our arrival from New York.. The food was mixed. My wife had octopus with a gooey mayonnaise-type sauce that was not great.

Beyond Nonna -- to excellence,"Chef Anna Maria Barbieri looks like a classic Italian Nonna -- and a bit like my own grandmother. Pink cheeks and a fabulous smile. My grandma was a wonderful home cook. Chef Anna Maria goes much further and turns traditional ""home"" italian cooking into sublime cuisine. Straightforward -- you can taste all the ingredients. Simple -- the ingredients come through simply and are not hidden under inappropriate additions. Subtle -- how can orecchiette with scallops and a light cream sauce have so many flavors swirling around?
We had the fish tasting menu and wine pairing. Highly recommended. The wine list is both deep and wide in style and cost.
The trip is about 15-20 minutes by taxi from central Modena on a bland commercial main road -- except for the auto showrooms (Ferrari, Mazerati, Audi, Porsche, etc.).

Not On Weekends; Otherwise OK,"We went twice for convenient dinners on this trip. The first was a Wednesday evening for pizza and buffola mozzarella with tomatoes. No reservation. All went well. Captain and waiters friendly; lots of ""extras"" -- glass of prosecco, fried dough munchies, after dinner lemoncello. Food was good; pizza crusty and mozzarella fresh. Friday night was quite different. Made a reservation, but put at a table where waiters and staff whizzing by and occasionally bumping into my chair. Asked Captain to move. He said he would try and then disappeared. The more protected table we wanted stayed open, but no offer to move. We ordered sparkling water and got still water. First waiter we asked to change, made an unfriendly face and disappeared. The next waiter was better and made the change. The food was OK -- spaghetti with clams, veal milanese. Perfectly acceptable; nothing to write home about. Mostly, the Friday evening was hectic and the staff (including the same Captain) simply did not keep up well.

Make sure your rate includes breakfast -- eggs, bacon, lots of breads, meats, cheeses, fruits, cereals. Good coffee. Excellent.
But most of all, the young staff have great, buoyant esprit and are very helpful.

Non-touristy excellent food near Duomo,"Don't be fooled by the location or the somewhat cool reception. This place is literally 30 seconds from the west side of Duomo Square where tourists and mediocre touristy restaurants abound. But, this one is first class in food and service -- at least the wait staff; the owner was a bit frosty. The breading on the veal milanese was light and well seasoned and the veal itself was still pink and soft. Ravioli with pumpkin/squah filling and ricotta-filed squash blossoms had the same, delicious butter-based sauce. The wine list was good, large and reasonable -- from very high end to very local.

Almost Perfect,"This is a small and very charming place. The service is superb -- easy, friendly, quick and responsive. I wasn't sure about choosing between two wines. The waitress offered to take back the first try when it proved uninteresting -- nothing really wrong, but bland. She replaced it with the other choice, which was excellent -- and the owner gave me a corkscrew with the restaurant's name ""for the next bottle."" Very nice gesture, which reflects the owner's awareness and concern for all that is happening .
The cooking is simple, in the way that is very hard to do well. The special of a whole fish (sea bass was the current choice) baked in salt was over-the-top good, with nothing but a bit of butter and not-overdone vegetables. Perhaps the best fish I, my wife and our friends ever had.
The rest of the meal was very good, but nothing could match that fish so the rest seemed ""almost perfect.""",October 2016,Riviera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d1087350-Reviews-Riviera-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Easy To Love; Hard To Reserve,"This is my second review of this wonderful place. The last (unfortunately) was 5 years ago, but it only gets better. It is hard to find, and they don't take reservations by email or on their website, but once you call for the reservation and find the place (we made a dry run in the morning light), it is such a great joy. The women owners are friendly and the food every time we have been there has been the very best for a mid-price restaurant in Venice. Whose idea was it to add Parmesan cheese to sauted clams? Smart chef -- it was a delicious version of one of my favorite dishes. The same clams with spaghetti (my wife's order) was also good, but the pasta was a bit heavy for the light sauce. All things fish were simple, fresh and sweet -- even the anchovies! The Venetian liver and onions (when in Venice, ....) was crisp on the outside and meltingly soft over all. Great. It is a small place and popular, but there was no feeling of being either crowded or rushed.",October 2016,Antiche Carampane,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d1087359-Reviews-Antiche_Carampane-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Perfectly located, comfortable, very helpful staff. Can be noisy.","We stayed in June, Midsummer weekend. The plus side is that the hotel is perfectly located for getting to most sites, to the boat tours, to central tram and bus stops for wider roaming, and to the central train station. Also, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful with all the important and mundane things that you need for a first trip to a city. The bedding was very comfortable. Last but not least, the breakfast is abundant and well prepared.

The not-so-plus side is that our room was a bit noisy, even with double glazing -- ask for a room that is not close to the tram line. Also, the room was a bit small; not easy to get about for two people. We had a ""comfort double"" which is the middle size.

"Friendly, but mediocre","Reception and waiter friendly and reasonably efficient. Waiter covering too many tables. The food, however, was mediocre at best. I had what seemed on the menu to be a creative dish of yellow pepper stuffed with veal and wheatberries with tomatoes. What arrived had little or no flavor; the peppers were unrecognizable; there was very little veal and the tomato sauce was made days earlier and reheated. It was like an uninspired veal parmigiano with little or no veal. My wife had sauteed chicken pieces with ""sweet and sour onions."" What arrived was a chicken stew that was overcooked, dry and essentially tasteless with matching onions. It all tasted like it had been cooked hours before and had been sitting around.

The delight of Matisse -- on a plate for lunch.,"The light, the color, the line of the drawing and the off-the-chart robes for priests at the Matisse Chapel in Vence are as beautiful as it gets. The combined effect, for me, is youthful enthusiasm and creativity. We walked down the block to Les Bacchanales for lunch -- we knew nothing about it; had seen the roadside sign on the way to the Chapel, and it was lunch time. What a wonderful surprise and delight. It had an enthusiasm and creativity and youthful feeling very like the Chapel. The view is superb. Lunch is only prix fixe and only one meat and one fish to choose from.

Fabulous food without attitude,"Watching the kitchen of a top-notch restaurant at the height of a busy meal -- especially when it is ""slammed"" -- reveals the ""soul"" of the chef, the cook staff and the wait staff. Gennaro Esposito is full of soul. In the midst of a huge rush of orders with everyone scurrying like mad to keep up, he was having great fun. No yelling, screaming, frantic movements. Just calm, super-efficient, smiling coordination. The communication with staff was almost silent -- a nod, a raised eyebrow, a finger point. And the staff was clearly devoted to him. It was the happiest intense kitchen I have ever seen -- only Pic matched it. I wished I had the talent (and time) to leave my job and work there.

The result on the table was exquisite. Unfussy cooking that coaxed deep flavors, especially the fish, both raw and cooked. The kind of cooking that takes immense effort to get the simple, clear taste enhanced by sauces you almost don't notice until you realize how much is going on in your mouth. The fish sous-chef (a young Asian woman whose name I forgot to keep -- dumb!) is a grand talent.

Setting and service are delightful, as in the other reviews.

"Excellent location, service, price","This small (38 rooms) hotel is an excellent location just south of Blvd.St. Germain. Very easy to get anywhere in Paris by Metro or Bus. It is a 3-star hotel with reasonable prices for Paris, but it has all the modern equipment of a 4 star hotel, now including free Wi-Fi in all the rooms (in the past, there was only plug-in internet in the rooms). There is no restaurant, nor should there be with everything from Michelin 3-star palaces to classic local bistros to upstart young hot-shot chefs within 10-15 minutes. As all of the other reviews have said, the staff is very helpful and friendly.",January 2012,Hotel Pas de Calais,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d219982-Reviews-Hotel_Pas_de_Calais-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,5.0,4.5
Perfect and reasonable in heart of Naples,"Very helpful staff; perfect location for getting the feel and flavor of central Naples; the good rooms are large, airy well furnished; but some of the smaller rooms are small and dark; all rooms are quiet with new, double glazed windows with shutters; breakfast very good fruits, coffee, breads, etc. Not fancy or elegant, even though formerly a family palazzo and, reportedly, a bordello, but makes you feel comfortable, taken care of and Neapolitan.",October 2010,Chiaja Hotel de Charme,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187785-d267249-Reviews-Chiaja_Hotel_de_Charme-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0
