Great Visit,"The price of entry was well worth the visit! The scenery from the top, the ancient buildings and history... amazing! Friendly people, and the food is tasty and affordable",March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Delphi and Thermopylae full day tour.. great trip!,"We had a private tour in a very nice and comfortable vehicle.. just the driver, my wife, and me. The price was not much more than a full bus tour would have cost, and we had the ability to stop anywhere we wanted, and stay as long or as little as we wanted. The driver did a great job.. loved the snow covered mountains, countryside scenery, ruins of Delphi, and so much more. I was glad we went to the site of the Sparta/Persian battle of Thermopylae, but wish they had more at the location. It was just a couple of monuments. I think they are loosing out on a GREAT area to have a museum and doze/excavate the battlefield so that it would be easier to imagine what the battle might have been like. Athens in general is a great place visit.. the food is inexpensive and delicious. The people are friendly, and we felt safe.
