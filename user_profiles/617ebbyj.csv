"A steep climb, but excellent views","Views from this place are amazing. Best in Athens. Lovely streets filled with orange trees as you walk to the hill. Took the cable car on the way down. Would recommend to take it one way. One car every 30 mins, not sure if the service is more frequent in summer. Must see place in Athens!",November 2019,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

must see for a sports fan,Didn't expect that we would see much when we were outside. Was pleasantly surprised when we got in. Great view from the top of the stadium and decent audio guide included with the entry ticket. Have to pay for the toilets outside though.

Amazing place,"Lot of history and well maintained area. We were there in the off peak season, hence took couple of minutes to buy the ticket and get in. Was told it takes couple of hours to get in during summer. Still was busy inside considering it was late Nov. Must see if you like history and want good views of Athens.",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
