My expectations were met and over exceeded. I am a chef and was amazed at how fresh and flavorful the food was. I could not easily replicate this cooking. These guys really know how to cook!
We ate from the vegan menu and had the vegan chicken subji korma, garlic naan and samosas. It was all perfection.

Super

‚ÄúOlive Oil With Aged Briam‚Äù,"Positive:
The amazing view, fried potatoes, water and view.

Negative:
We asked about the vine leaves ‚ÄúThe Vine leaves are canned‚Äù this is a warning sign at a Greek restaurant.
The white wine they served tasted a bit like a week old pre opened bottle.
The briam I was served was extremely sad, soggy, waterlogged, depressed, laughable, and really was the joke of our vacation.

Conclusion:
I would eat the terrible briam again for the view and laughs. The view!",September 2019,Taverna Agrapidos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1150017-d2185855-Reviews-Taverna_Agrapidos-Poros_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
