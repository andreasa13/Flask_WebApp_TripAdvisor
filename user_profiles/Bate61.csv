Early morning at the acropolis!,"Get there early, we were e there at 8.45 am no queues, tickets from the ticket office needed to be bought with cash, though there were some automatic machines where it looked like you could use cards. We bought a ticket that lays 5 days but it wasnâ€™t explained that although you had entry into 7 different places you could only access each one once. We only found this out on leaving, by which time it was to late as we didnâ€™t see everything on the Acropolis site. However what we did see was fantastic!!!",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great electric bike tour!,George was a great guide! We had a perfect tour seeing the iconic sights with a fab history lesson. George tailored the tour enabling us to see the changing of the Guards at the Presidential residence and even a wave from the President of Greece himself!!! We had time for a visit inside the stadium before a lovely ride back through Plaka. We thoroughly recommend this tour.,October 2019,Athens Electric Bike Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11455118-Athens_Electric_Bike_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
