Flew Delta Airlines International and it was GREAT,"I contacted Delta airlines reference my points. The customer service representative worked with me setting up a perfect vacation flight to Greece for 3-weeks. On my time schedule. Everything was great. Flights were all on time. The aircraft and attendants were helpful and courteous. Comfortable seats. I paid a little extra for the Comfort+. I highly recommend Delta for both domestic and international trips.

Worth every moment,"I wrote an excellent review for the Acropolis, which included the two theaters in the beginning and then all the structures above. If you enjoy history and the wonders of the world then you want to visit this location. I took a guided tour because there is so much to hear and learn. Truly amazing! Visit the Acropolis Museum to truly understand the beauty and ancient artifacts. It is a modern and comfortable museum.",October 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
AMAZING! Both day and night.,"Who doesn’t want to see the most amazing ancient temple in the world? So much history here and it is hard to comprehend how it was achieved. The climb was steep, but just take your time. Make sure you have good shoes with traction. The marble can be slippery. Wet or dry. I used a guide for this one. Just too much history to miss. “Athens Walking Tours” is excellent. They have a large variety of tours and are inexpensive. I took the “5-hour” tour for 99 Euro. 30 of that covered the tickets. It covered parts of Athens (Plaka), Changing of the Guard for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Parliament, National Garden, Acropolis, the Museum, and other sites. Worth every penny. Just check their website carefully to make the right selection for you. Make sure you visit the Acropolis Museum afterwards so you can truly understand the splendor of the ancient Acropolis. This incredibly spacious, modern, and comfortable museum houses wonderful artifacts and also explains the reconstruction efforts.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worth every moment,"I toured the Acropolis and almost skipped the museum. I am so glad I decided to go inside. It seemed too busy, but the entry was timely and easy. The entire staff was friendly and even humorous at times. I really enjoyed the entrance way movie. The building and layout was beautiful and well maintained. Very spacious. The artifacts were incredible. It really helped me visualize the true ancient Acropolis. I also enjoyed the restaurant and outside balcony where I could again observe the Acropolis. Great job, Greece!!",October 2019,Skip the Line: Athens New Acropolis Museum Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12835132-Skip_the_Line_Athens_New_Acropolis_Museum_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
Excellent guided tour.,"I usually visit sites in my own, but I felt this 5 hour tour of the Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, Changing of the Guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and other sites in Athens would be worth it, and it was. After all, this is a big part of history for our western civilization. The 99 eu tour included 3 tickets valued at 36 eu. Athens Walking Tour was very accommodating and our group did not encounter any problems. We actual had a good time together.

Our tour guide was Evita (I hope I got that right.) and she was wonderful. Very knowledgeable and personable. She spoke very loudly and clear. Her sense of humor was awesome. She turned this into more than a sight seeing tour. It was a trip through history.",October 2019,Athens Walking Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d644888-Reviews-Athens_Walking_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent Turkish & Mediterranean Food,"We have been to this cozy restaurant in Cary, NC several times. The food is excellent right along with the service. They use perfectly blended spices and herbs on their grilled kabobs, meats, and chicken. Try the lamb and Gyros. I read a review that said the food is bland. It is not. It is perfectly seasoned. Even the salads. This is coming from a traveler who has eaten local foods throughout several Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries. This is a stylish restaurant where you can go to eat and relax. Feel free to dress casually. My favorite is the Cigar Bourek as an appetizer and the Mixed Grill Kabob followed by perfect Baklava. Not too sweet. The salads and bread are delicious. Did I say, bread. Careful not to fill up before your order arrives. It is addictive. Have some hot Turkish tea instead of coffee. The menu is very descriptive, but don’t be shy about asking your server how each dish is prepared. Enjoy! We do.",October 2019,Bosphorus Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49007-d595190-Reviews-Bosphorus_Restaurant-Cary_North_Carolina.html,"Cary, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fun Place for Our Grandchildren,"We have been taking our grandchildren here for years. So much to see and do, and everything is well done and clean. Entry cost is minimal and security is tight. Plus they have added new attractions such as the mini golf play area. There has been a drastic improvement in the restaurant. The food was always okay, but now it is fairly delicious. The gift shop is rather large and fantastic. Let the kids test their science skills and taste buds. Occasionally, we will go to the adjoining IMAX movie theater. They have super sized movies for both children and adults. Day and night. Each of the unique play areas are closed in and offer children different realistic and colorful challenges.

Across the street is the newly renovated Moore’s Square. A great place to run around. You can also visit the nearby NC Museum of Natural History. There are also a few highly rated restaurants within walking distance.",August 2019,Marbles Kids Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g49463-d149465-Reviews-Marbles_Kids_Museum-Raleigh_North_Carolina.html,"Raleigh, North Carolina",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worth the Visit - Delicious,"This is your traditional Greek restaurant, but stylish. Nice relaxing atmosphere and our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The food was delicious. If you think you have had a good Gyro wrap you might want to try one here. My wife loved her Pastitsio (Greek lasagna) and sautéed vegetables. The Baclava cheesecake was insane. Calamari was pretty good. I loved the sauce. The Greek Sangria includes brandy. It will grow on you after the second glass. We will be back to try other dishes.",October 2019,Taverna Agora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49463-d444938-Reviews-Taverna_Agora-Raleigh_North_Carolina.html,"Raleigh, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nasty location,"Man, is this place nasty. Typical KFC food that was okay. Service was good. However, it was 3:00pm and only a handful of customers. Most every table was dirty, to include the floor. The trash receptacles were overflowing, and the bathroom was filthy. There was even trash in the parking lot. I noticed the same conditions when I was there several months ago. I can’t imagine what the back kitchen area is like. I’ll skip this location in the future.",September 2019,KFC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49153-d4398343-Reviews-KFC-Garner_North_Carolina.html,"Garner, North Carolina",restaurants,1.0,2.5
Great Seafood & Service,"This is some seriously delicious seafood. The King crab legs were incredible. The meat was firm and sweet. The shrimp, sausage, potatoes and corn were perfect. All in a big bag with our choice of spices and heat. We got the cajun, garlic, butter and lemon mixed with medium heat. They thought medium was hot. We didn’t. I was also surprised at the cheesecake. Who would have thought it would be that good in a rugged looking seafood restaurant. The service was outstanding. The manager even came over and helped one of us break and clean the crab legs. What a sweetheart. We will be baaaack.",September 2019,Raleigh Crab House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49463-d14267808-Reviews-Raleigh_Crab_House-Raleigh_North_Carolina.html,"Raleigh, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Food & Service,We go here several times a year. The menu is of course unique but more importantly everything is delicious. All the servers are friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable. It is also located in an interesting part of downtown Raleigh. Well worth the visit.

Excellent Atmosphere & Food,"We just tried both of the main soups and they were okay. It is just us. Give them a try since they are popular entrees. Surprisingly, the chicken wings were incredible. Large, twice fried and the sauces were out of this world. We like the unique ambiance and the servers are very helpful and friendly. A big plus. We have eaten there in the past and enjoyed both meals. This is one of the restaurants you visit and it becomes memorable. If you are not there for lunch or dinner within the first 15 minutes they open you might want a reservation. A lot of people love this place. We do.

Excellent food and service,"If you want an experience, or show off for your friends, go there. Lunch or dinner.

"Excellent food, service and atmosphere","I heard a lot about the Angus Barn and we finally stopped in. First, you get to experience a very unique decor. Then comes some of the best service and food you will find in the Raleigh area. The steaks areveverything you hear about... Delicious!

Excellent atmosphere and food.,We went there twice and sat in the decorated garden by the outside bar. Great food and service. The camel and the beef were delicious. Service and prices were just as welcomed.,March 2019,Cote Jardin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293823-d6654344-Reviews-Cote_Jardin-Niamey.html,"Niamey, Niger",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"One of the few better hotels, but in desperate need","This is one of the better hotels in Niamey, but is in desperate need of maintenance and customer service. I suspect the new Radison Hotel nearby will hurt them if they do not clean up their act. The Grand offers regular hotel rooms, but the bungalows seem nicer. There is a very large pool patio in the back overlooking the Niger River and a major bridge leading to the three tabletop mountains. (Don’t go there!). Great view and a great place for people watching. The patio service is very good and the food is even better. The beef brochettes are tender and tasty. So are the pizzas and French fries. Try the delicious HOT salsa dip. Just a small dip until you get use to the heat. The evening mosquitoes are hungry as well. Use a skin spray or coils. This is a great place to relax and meet new friends.

The inside restaurant offers the bare necessities and a daily continental breakfast that was not bad. You can order eggs at an extra cost, but they are not well prepared. Be specific about what you want! We were given a free breakfast with our package deal, but made to sign a daily receipt. We informed the restaurant and the front desk about this. They said we wouldn’t be charged, but we were. Unfortunately we did not spot this daily charge, which was in French, until we got home. We assumed the daily $8.86 USD charge was a hotel tax since it was listed next to the room charge.

Overall, the buildings are in need of repair and cleaning. Even a good paint job would go a long way. Inside and out. A few of the people at the front desk were helpful and friendly, but some were not. They really need some customer service training. I complained three times about the lack of hot water and pressure in my shower. Nothing was fixed. After approaching the manager, a week later, he moved me to a new room and the next day they were ripping the hot water heater out of my old room. Trying to get currency exchanged at the counter was always difficult. Very unfriendly lady, who seemed annoyed when you bothered her. Most of the time we were just waved off. There are three ATMs in the lobby and I would suggest using those to get local cash as opposed to using your credit card around town. Most of the bills are 10,000 West African francs (XOF). You can purchase food or beer at the outside patio or inside bar and they will gladly break down you larger bills.

There is an excellent French restaurant down the road, The Côté Jardin. A Lebanese restaurant as well. The small bar was an excellent place to sit inside and enjoy the WiFi and company. The first few days we had constant problems with the hotel’s Building A and B WiFi. They finally gave us a week long complimentary voucher to use the Free 24-hour WiFi offered by a local company. That worked well. I found that tipping got me a long way with better service. Even 1,000 or 2,000 West African CFA francs can buy an employee a full meal at home. Be generous.",March 2019,Grand Hotel du Niger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293823-d480713-Reviews-Grand_Hotel_du_Niger-Niamey.html,"Niamey, Niger",hotels,2.0,3.0
The Perfect Experience and Comfort,"I travel all around the world and this business trip was 30 days long. Thanks to this Marriott, I did not want it to end. I was a little worried about being next to the airport. No problem. Plenty quiet inside. My room, which overlooked the golf course, was as comfortable as they come. Room service...perfect! The Executive Lounge was a great place to relax and enjoy a delicious breakfast, with terrific dishes and happy hour drinks in the evening as well. The main downstairs bar was an experience we will always remember. We became friends with the friendliest bartenders I have ever enjoyed. The hotel connected with an upscale casino and mall. Plenty of Marriott restaurants and even more in the mall. Including Wolfgang Puck. Great gyms, pools, and spas. Yes, plural. Just go upstairs to book any of several tours. I enjoyed all the many events. I might just go back for a personal vacation this time. Might not come home.",February 2019,Manila Marriott Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298452-d1536444-Reviews-Manila_Marriott_Hotel-Pasay_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,"Luzon, Philippines",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent Dining Experience,"We have known about Bahama Breeze for years, but never stopped in. What a big mistake. Not only did the decor remind us of South Florida and the Caribbean, but the food was delicious. Cocktails were crazy. Great selections for both. Ruby was the perfect waitress. I certainly didn’t think of this as a grill. It was very spacious inside and comfortable. I highly recommend Bahama Breeze if you are looking for something different and better. The Emanadas and Conch Fritters were good. The curry goat was exceptionally tender and spicy. The way it should be. Steak, black beans, and plantains were perfect. We will be back!!",February 2019,Bahama Breeze,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49463-d444916-Reviews-Bahama_Breeze-Raleigh_North_Carolina.html,"Raleigh, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Great Hotel and Staff in downtown Muscat, Oman","First, let me say my overall experience at the Radisson Blu in downtown Muscat, Oman was “Excellent”. We stayed there during our two-week business trip and everything about this hotel and friendly staff made that trip pleasurable and conducive to our work needs. The rooms and facilities were very nice and well kept, as was were all the areas and amenities. I especially enjoyed Olivo’s Restaurant and Terrace, the spacious pool, gym, and more importantly the staff. They were all very professional and friendly. The business center was also convenient. Access to multiple computer stations made it easy and I did not have to pay for every sheet of paper I used. (However, I do wish the multi-printer had a scanner function for the computers.) The Italian restaurant was also very nice as was the convenience of having O’Malley’s Irish pub just below. A great place for expats and visitors. We truly appreciated the many discounts. Especially the free breakfast buffet where the food and service were exceptionable. We had to leave the hotel early every morning, so management was gracious enough to open the restaurant 15 minutes earlier for us. We also received a discount for laundry and dry cleaning. My only complaint was, like most hotels around the world, the lack of hot or even warm water for morning showers. This is the only reason I lowered my overall rating. I am sure this can be easily remedied. We also enjoyed the central location and were able to walk to many other restaurants and coffee houses. The room and bed were clean and comfortable, but I would suggest some firmer pillows to go along with the softer type. Even when our car battery died, someone immediately brought out a jumper box and we made it to work on time. I would absolutely stay at the Radisson Blue again.",September 2017,Radisson Blu Hotel Muscat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1940497-d306470-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Muscat-Muscat_Muscat_Governorate.html,"Muscat, Oman",hotels,4.0,4.0
