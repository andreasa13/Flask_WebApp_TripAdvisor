Outstanding,"The first thing about The Three Horeshoes were the lovely staff, so friendly and but me as ease during these unusual times. The second was the food, it was amazing the best food I have had in a very long time and the third thing is the location absolutely stunning views. I would highly recommend going there whether you are a visitor to the area or you live there.",August 2020,The Three Horseshoes Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186454-d1367486-Reviews-The_Three_Horseshoes_Inn-Brecon_Brecon_Beacons_National_Park_Wales.html,"Brecon, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Stunning,"It is worth going to Athens just to see the amazing site. However be prepared for crowds, very busy when we went.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Tired,"The hotel initially looks pleasant enough when you arrive and the bar area is comfortable. However the rooms are very tired looking with the showers looking really grubby!! The saving grace for this hotel is Panos, he is the most welcoming and friendly member of staff I have ever come across in my 17 years of city breaks.

The other aspect of this hotel is the area, not very attractive and did not feel safe.",October 2019,Athens Odeon Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d576874-Reviews-Athens_Odeon_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,2.0,3.0

Highly recommended,A treat from my husband for my birthday and I can not express enough how stunning the food was and how excellent the staff were.

Lunch with attitude,"Met with friends for lunch and have to say found the service extremely disappointing.
Ordered our food with 2 out of 3 requesting chips, when the waitress arrived with the food there was some confusion over what had been ordered as we didn't know if the chips were arriving separately or on the plate with the panini (nor could we see as the seats were low down) when questioned the response from the waitress was ""I'll fetch the chips now, I've got one pair of hands!!""

Not exactly customer friendly, won't be going again!!",June 2017,Portland House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g316016-d4437243-Reviews-Portland_House-Llandrindod_Wells_Powys_Wales.html,"Llandrindod Wells, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Perfect location,"Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights with a group of friends, it was the perfect location being central to the to the old town. The rooms were comfortable and clean, plenty of choice for breakfast. Would highly recommend this hotel if you're going to Gdansk",October 2016,Hotel Artus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274725-d2091747-Reviews-Hotel_Artus-Gdansk_Pomerania_Province_Northern_Poland.html,"Gdansk, Poland",hotels,5.0,4.0
Great little find,"My husband and I visited Stratford upon Avon recently to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We decided to have our anniversary meal here and have to say it was the best decision!!
