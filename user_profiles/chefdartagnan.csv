Must see church. 6-7 minutes from train station.,"This church, along with 3 others once served as the seat of papacy. If you are a history buff of church history, this is a must see.

Two small drawbacks, a tuk tuk ride to Galle old town is about 30 minutes but an interesting ride with sights to see along the way. Second, the Wifi is sporadic on the higher floors.

The car had 12+ dings and scratches, all noted on the inspection report. Car was dirty inside and out. Papers and food debris left from previous rentals. We had a flat tire and when we had it repaired, we discovered that the tire had been flat before and a previous renter had an inner tube put in to get by. Well, it gave out on us. We bought a used tire for $20 and had it put back on the vehicle with no further problems. Return went smoothly. We had to place a 40,000 rupee ($220)deposit in addition to the rental fee. We waited a week after we got back and it was not credited back on our charge card. After several emails, the credit did go thru minus the extra mileage, which we were expecting.

"Nice room, Walking marathon to get there","Stayed in a tower on 22nd floor. To get there from the registration, had to use 2 elevators and walk about 1/4 mile. To get to the front entrance from the room, had to walk almost a 3/4 mile. Room was very nice and quiet but downstairs at the entertainment and gaming level, there were tons of running noisy kids. While this is probably the only family casino/hotel in Vegas,the crowds are something to deal with on weekends. The buffet was just average for that city. Some other food options are limited and a bit pricey, but that is Las Vegas.",January 2018,Circus Circus Hotel & Casino Las Vegas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d91770-Reviews-Circus_Circus_Hotel_Casino_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,3.0,3.5

Nice day trip,The dam is one of the wonders of the West and you should see it once in your life. The amount and work and lives given to build it is amazing when you see the size of it.

"Great Stay, beautiful scenery","This was a 3 day stay as part of the fly package from Air Tahiti Nui, so we did not expect much but were pleasantly surprised. This is a closed resort with all the landscaping, giant pool, restaurants, beach and service you would expect from a resort hotel. Our only hiccup was that they placed the packages deals off to the side of the resort building and not that convenient to the main activities. The view out our door, for instance, was a shipping container, but the view out the sliding door was a giant bush, blocking all view of the grounds. Breakfast buffet was 100+ items and excellent.

The Hungarian hot dog is the best item, but the Mac and Cheese was strange in that it uses Spatzle instead of macaroni.

Living off reputation,"Ordered a corned beef ($20.25). It had the looks and texture of being sliced several hours before, placed in a steam pan and set in a steam table uncovered. The meat had a hard, dried out crust, tough and many pieces were overly fatty. A Philly Steak sandwich was fine ($20.25). A egg salad sandwich had a good flavor ($27.75).
