Futility of Wars.,"I visited this rate and unusual Museum that displays photographic exhibits by renowned photojournalists
who covered recent and earlier regional and global conflicts.

For a leisurely walk.,"Though the hotel where I was staying is almost one hour walk,I chose to spend most of my time at this beautiful and little Old Town. Raising from the XVth century ramparts of medieval fortification, the present Town with narrow lanes, alleys, shops, cafes, two museums, churches, houses gave me a nostalgic glimpse of the past. There are five gates through which one can enter freely and wander leisurely. The Iron Gate, huge Bell, Bishop's palace, Citadel( require admission ticket), and scintillating views of coastline is most memorable for any traveller. I chose Budva though many travellers stay at Kotor and do a day trip, as I was keen to see the enchanting beaches and free from crowds.

Darkest chapter in human history.,"This Museum not only capture the heroic story of Macedonian Jewry from ancient times but also saddest moments of darkest chapter in human history that witnessed annihilation of 98% of Macedonian Jews based on authentic sources.
