Fantastic dinner,"The restaurant is very small and you need a reservation (take a look at the website, WhatsApp works). The dinner itself was fantastic and very very vey much value for money. The basically have a set menu for the evening. Our special request(s) were met promptly. We got wonderful suggestions for wines that would go with each dish.
The athmosphere was cozy and relaxed, service was absolutely superior!",March 2020,Farmhouse Kings Cross,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d4791952-Reviews-Farmhouse_Kings_Cross-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,5.0
A must see of Ancient Greece,"Probably the best collection of Greek archeological finds.

Superb Greek lunch,"Obviously a popular restaurant among locals. They have lunch here or have take away to bring home.
We got great service and had a sort of tasting menu of veal, pork, fish ... all Greek “home” style.

I probably had the best Greek salad ever here. So delicious!",April 2019,5F,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d5312490-Reviews-5F-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
"Friendly staff, good location","Location of the hotel is excellent if you are spending a couple of nights in Athens and want to explore the historiaan sites (Acropolis) and find nice reastaurants near hotel.

The room was typical European city hotel size (ok for 2persons for 3 nights with only hand baggage). Bathroom had a ’high end design’ style but lacked a bit of functionality. Still, everything worked well and the room and the hotel was clean.

WiFi (free) worked fine. The reception staff was very kind in helping us with some connection issues.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. From the first second on we felt very welcome in the hotel.

The location is at Psiri, on a side street of Ermou Street that runs from Monastiraki Square. The metro from airport (Blue line) stops at Monastiraki station and you have about 500m-700m walk along Ermou street to the hotel. The neighbourhood might seem ’rough’ with graffiti,etc. and its not the tidiest of streets. However, we did not have or see anything that would have made us feel anyway unsafe.

The nearest metro station is Thissio (Green line) about 200m away. You can walk up to one of Acropolis’ gates just going upwards from Thissio station.",April 2019,O&B Athens Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d607425-Reviews-O_B_Athens_Boutique_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5

Wonderful experience,"This wine bar is definitely something to check out while in Athens.

They have a great selection of Greek wines and delicacies. We tried the “Greek white wine ambassador” wine tasting menu: just for 18€ you get 5 different Greek white wines (small glass, 75ml) and the very attentive and friendly staff tells you the story of each wine.
We also tried the Greek cheese & chutney tasting menu -well worth the money. We would have spent another night here if we had the time.

The staff was most helpful, knew their stuff and was able to serve the customers in multitude of languages!
The place can be quite full, but it’s also possible to make reservations.",April 2019,Cinque Wine & Deli Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d9462540-Reviews-Cinque_Wine_Deli_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
"Tasty but lukewarm pizza, service leaves much room for improvement","Getting a table took a surprisingly long time in a half full Restaurant. Drink orders were brought to the table quickly but receiving the food order was something that seemed to be difficult for the staff. Finally getting the bill was also troublesome because the staff did not know what we had ordered. However, the staff was friendly.

Very basic but convenient,"This restaurant offers quite traditional Viennese specialities at a fair price. Everything worked quite ok and the food was according to expectations. The interior has a kind of Scandinavian/IKEA feel to it, so that does not in my opinion play well with the traditional Viennese theme.
It’s a safe choice if you are not expecting a mind blowing culinary experience.",July 2018,Wienerwald,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190454-d1960378-Reviews-Wienerwald-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Exhausting collection,"Must see: Venus of Willendorf. Also dinosaur fossiles etc. All kinds of “stuffed animals” from birds to tigers, lions and elephants. Not much queuing fortunately.

"Simple and basic, good location","Room was quite normal/small to European standards. It was a bit worn down and especially the bathroom would have needed an upgrade. The price was very competitive.
The location is quite good at the Congreso Plaza. You can have nice and afordable breakfast at one of the several cafes around the plaza. There are also some small grocery stores just around the corner (5 minutes walk from hotel) as well as pharmacist’s, etc.
At the plaza we saw a number of homeless people sleeping and spending their time but overall we felt quite secure.",November 2017,Ibis Buenos Aires Congreso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312741-d300790-Reviews-Ibis_Buenos_Aires_Congreso-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",hotels,3.0,4.0
"Good value, clean rooms","The hotel is located on a fairly quiet street, but just a few steps away from Pisa’s ”High Street”, Corso Italia. A/C in the room worked quite alright during early August heatwave (+35C), but it was clearly at its limits. The room was kept very clean. Bottled water (0.5 litres) was free of charge in the room’s minibar (of course new bottle every day).

The staff was friendly, even though I had to wait for my room due to very early arrival, I got to leave my luggage in a storage room next to the reception desk.

The breakfast offered pleanty of choice and was of a good continental standard. In the evening one can enjoy a drink at the hotel bar (same room as the breakfast room). WiFi was free and it worked without effort (but remember to take care of your cybersecurity as the passwords etc. are general)

There is a good-sized ”Conad ” Supermarket pretty close to the hotel (200m) on Via S. Giuseppe Cottolengo. Walk to the Leaning Tower takes about 20 minutes. There are some nice restaurants closer to Arno River, across Corso Italia at Piazza Chiara Gambacorti.

The hotel is in an old building and decorated in a pretty old-fashioned way, so don’t expect anything too “modern”. Everything worked smoothly during my stay although nothing was particularly spectacular. I think the hotel was really good value for money.

"Iconic ""must-see"" site","Join the club of millions of people that have a photo of themselves seemingly trying to hold up the Leaning tower, or trying to topple it down altogether.

"Tallin City Hotel - central location, basically OK (average standard)","Cheking in went quite promptly. Service was basically OK the whole time but a bit expressionless.
Standard room with twin beds was fairly nice. Room size is quite small, which may start to annoy if two people stay with a lot of luggage for a longer time. But nice and OK for one or two nights. All the basics were functioning. Wi-Fi worked in the room. TV had Estonian and Finnish and some international channels.
The bathroom was quite tiny and ascetic. The biggest problem was clearly when you use the shower you basically end up wetting the whole bathroom floor, which is very inconvenient.
The hotel has a number of services on the first floor. You can get bottled water, toothbrushes, snacks, etc. Lobby bar is quite large and the restaurant is also OK, if you don't want to leave the hotel.
The location is excellent, right next to Viru Centre, less than 1 km from Old City and also 500m from Tallinn Harbour. There are usualli taxis right outside the main door.",December 2016,Tallink City Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274958-d487124-Reviews-Tallink_City_Hotel-Tallinn_Harju_County.html,"Tallinn, Estonia",hotels,3.0,3.5

Excellent hotel in so many ways,"Location is quite central, next to Stockmann store house. Front desk service was extremely nice and fluent. It's a high building so when I was asked for room preferences I asked to get a room as high up as possible. 20th floor views were superb. The room was very spacious, king size bed felt very comfortable. TV was big and had hotel info channel (use it to find out where and when breakfast is served!). Bathroom was huge, the shower booth one of the best I've ever had (rain shower). The room had slippers, bathgown, ironing equipment, safety box (easy to use). I only spent one night and did not have time to explore the hotel any further but I trust I visit there again.
Breakfast was very good (8th floor views), nice variety and food was displayed beautifully. Coffee was served on the table.
Basic Wi-Fi worked perfectly (but it is ""open"" so use your own VPN) and there is an option to upgrade it to ""premium"" for faster connection.",April 2017,Swissotel Tallinn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274958-d652609-Reviews-Swissotel_Tallinn-Tallinn_Harju_County.html,"Tallinn, Estonia",hotels,5.0,4.5
