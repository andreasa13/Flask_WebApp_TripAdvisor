Any request was answered and if they didn’t know the answer, they went above and beyond to find the answer.

The hotel is beautiful and the location cannot be beat. Spacious rooms, love the shower head and the elevators are quiet and quick. As an American with a big suitcase, I would love to see a dresser placed in the room, so there is adequate room to put your clothes and you’re not living out of a suitcase.

She stated the hostess will tell her if she's seated someone there because the table is not easily visible. My beef is if you KNOW this is a problem, make sure to let the server know.

A special thanks to Carin, our bartender. First, she remembered us from a visit we made in October and then upon learning we were celebrating my birthday, she presented me with a piece of white chocolate, raspberry sponge cake. Very thoughtful and make the visit extra special.
