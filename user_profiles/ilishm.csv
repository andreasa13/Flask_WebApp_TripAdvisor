What is not to like?,"Not to be missed. It is a must-see of our ancient civilization. By going in October, it was not as crowded.

Small but comfortable,"We stayed at this hotel twice, once for a night when we landed in Athens and once for a night before leaving. The room the second time was somewhat more spacious and the bathroom nicer, but both nights, the bed was comfortable and the room clean. Staff are very accommodating and pleasant. Although we got only a box breakfast that was not great the first morning, the next time we stayed, the breakfast was plentiful and good. The elevators are very small and so difficult to fit both of us and our luggage. We had to make two trips. The lobby is also very small and extremely crowded when there is a busload of people with their luggage. However, staff handled the situation remarkably well and were very accommodating. Bring your own dryer. There is one in the room, but not a type we are used to.

"Rooms fine enough, grounds lovely","We were there for one night only. The room was fine, although I would say it was more a 3 star than a 4 star. There is a need for some upkeep and it may come as tourism in Egypt increases and money becomes available for upkeep. However, the grounds were lovely and certainly well-maintained when we were there. I am surprised at the review in which the reviewer says the grounds were not clean and surprised there was any loud music. Not the case when we were there. The pool looked inviting, but we didn't have time to make use of it. For an hour, however, we sat out on the lawn in lawn chairs reading. That was relaxing after a long flight. The food was good.

The spot to eat in North Bay,"This is my third time to this restaurant in 2 months. The other two times were for a delicious lunch, but this time, for the Sunday brunch.

Impressive staff,"The staff at this hotel were most impressive, from check-in to the person on the night shift who went out of his way to provide us with some paper plates.

Surprised to find the bedspread dirty,"We often stay at a Comfort Inn when travelling and need to stay a night and are generally satisfied with the Comfort Inn as a stop-over and some even more than a stop-over. But not all Comfort Inns are equal. This one had a bedspread on the bed that had a burn hole in it and dirty spots. I mentioned it to the housekeeper who did change it in that she removed it and replaced it by a rather ratty blanket. The rest of the bed was clean and very comfortable. I mentioned it the next morning to staff when checking out, but their response was basically asking if the housekeeper removed the bedspread. I think they said they were sorry, but it certainly wasn't a sorry I would remember and no discount was given. Check-in and check-out was very perfunctory. I also feel there had been smoking either in the room or nearby previously. The rest of the room was very clean. Not sure if we will treat this as an aberration or find another hotel in Cambridge when we visit again in a couple of weeks.",October 2017,Comfort Inn Cambridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g154985-d182821-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Cambridge-Cambridge_Region_of_Waterloo_Ontario.html,"Cambridge, Canada",hotels,3.0,3.5
Great food and lovely surprise,"Doesn't seem from the outside that it is a great little restaurant, but it is! I was pleasantly surprised. Four of us went for brunch. I had French toast - best I have ever tasted. Busy place with few tables, so suggest you make a reservation. Server was friendly. And unlike other reviewer, we did not find the service slow, but just right. Rest of menu looks good and restaurant is licensed.

Overpriced for what you get,"Overpriced for what you get. Noisy. People in the rooms besides ours decided to get together outside for a couple of hours, smoking practically outside our window and keeping us awake until way after midnight. But the worst was the window cleaner who decided he would clean the windows in the morning around 10:30 - some may have been cleaned even earlier. Maybe a peeping Tom - not sure - but it seemed that way. I complained to the receptionist about the noise and the window cleaner. She gave us a discount of $10.00 as a result. She said it was the best she could do. She and the receptionist who checked us in were very nice. Not a lot of choice of where to stay in the area so maybe that's why we pay so much for an old motel room. (And no breakfast on weekends!! Strange rule.)",September 2017,Red Pine Inn & Conference Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g182201-d182799-Reviews-Red_Pine_Inn_Conference_Centre-Alliston_New_Tecumseth_Ontario.html,"Alliston, Canada",hotels,2.0,3.0
Don't hesitate to book here,"Lovely spacious room overlooking one of the ""lagoons"". Very clean and bed extremely comfortable. Service very friendly and front desk very accommodating over the mix-up in the room reserved. We managed to work out a deal that benefited both of us. We had an upper floor room, but if you are concerned about carrying your luggage up to one because there are no elevators, staff will help - and there are not that many stairs to climb anyway. The ground floor rooms have a patio with a picnic table. The picnic tables need refinishing, but that is a minor point.

"Okay, but not great","We heard such great reviews of this restaurant, so quite surprised when we found ourselves very disappointed in the food. Maybe the restaurant was just too busy that night - and very loud because of a large table with many people at it, and a screaming child, situated just behind us - but the food was just not that good. Have had better Italian food many other places. I am not usually out of sync with the majority of reviews, so can only assume it was an off night. The pasta servings were too large and rather bland. Only the Caesar salad was good. Service was friendly enough, but too busy for the one server.",August 2017,Lanterna Ristorante North,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3349138-d10677846-Reviews-Lanterna_Ristorante_North-Brechin_Ramara_Ontario.html,"Brechin, Canada",restaurants,3.0,5.0
Nice restaurant for breakfast,"Had breakfast here for the two days we stayed at the hotel. A set breakfast came with our reservation and set it was - toast, bacon or sausage, egg and home fries, as well as coffee. Because I am a vegetarian had only the home fries and toast. have had much better, but it was still fine enough and a pleasant restaurant in which to have breakfast as it overlooks one of the lagoons. I don't know what the food is like if one ordered off the menu. Service was friendly provided we had as our servers one of the younger woman.

Great place to spend a summer's early evening,"Great location overlooking the marina and Sturgeon River. We sat on the patio on a beautiful evening over the long August weekend and had a Greek Pizza. It was delicious. Love the thin crust. We were surprised the restaurant wasn't busier - and perhaps that is why it closes at 7:00 on a summer's evening over a long weekend. However, that being said, it was more relaxing eating here than at both Twigg's in North Bay. Service was wonderful and servers were friendly.

A part of our heritage,"The Dionne Quints Museum is closed, so cannot be visited. Unfortunately North Bay City Council has decided to have the museum moved from the city, ignoring an important aspect of our heritage and ignoring the wishes of the two remaining Dionne quintuplets to have their birth home remain in North Bay. The province of Ontario made a lot of money from taking control of the quints, removing them from their family and having them on view for all to gawk at. The least our city can do is respect the wishes of the two remaining quints.

The rooms are spacious and clean and the bed is comfortable. We had a ground floor room for minimal carrying of luggage. Always a plus. Staff was very friendly. Breakfast is included and is okay,typical of Comfort Inn breakfasts.

Save your money.,"Four of us took one of the evening dinner Christmas Carol cruise on the Queen Burrard. The decor left a lot to be desired. There was little room to move around and the boat looked as if it had seen better days. It looked anything but festive, but old and tired. The dinner was terrible. It was basically inedible. The washrooms were filthy. And because of how slippery and how poorly lit the stairs and deck were, it was difficult to go up on deck to see the lights of Vancouver Harbour. However, we went up anyway and the lights were the best thing about the cruise. Forget about the Christmas carols - basically a contest to see which table can sing the best and the best is not too great. It seems as if this contest is but an excuse to get people to drink overly priced wine so they will sing. The music playing over the speakers as we entered the boat was so loud, we had to ask that it be turned down. Two of us had a glass of wine served in a small tumbler, not a wine glass. I would recommend you forget this cruise and spend your money on something else instead.

"Some small issues, mainly noise, but overall a nice place to stay.","We stayed in one of the rooms in the main lodge. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean, but it is small. The bed is very comfortable. The room décor seems to have taken precedence over control of the noise level. There is little to cushion sound. We could even hear our next door neighbours walk quietly in their room. Our patio door and bathroom door squeaked and we were concerned our neighbours heard these doors being opened and closed. We could also hear the restaurants patrons, although that did not bother us much. The patio is very large, but the railing is so high you cannot see over it to the lake while sitting. Strange mixture of styles and materials on the patio. Price of the room is a tad on the high side and you have to pay an extra $10.00 to have clean towels. All information in the room is in French except the envelope for a tip for maid service and there you will see a thank you. It would appear that as guests we could have ordered a continental breakfast for $5.00, but we were not told this at check-in. Nevertheless, staff was pleasant and helpful, although English seemed limited. Despite what I have said, we would return.

Great staff and nice hotel,"After reading a couple of reviews, such as hot stuffy room, I was a bit concerned about staying here, but there are no other hotels in Renfrew so I went ahead and booked. I was pleasantly surprised. Our room was very clean and well-appointed, a bit on the small side, but other than that, no complaints at all. We could open a window, always a definite plus for us - and that does wonders if your room is hot and stuffy. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. Can't say enough about them, at the front desk and in the restaurant. Downtown is only a short drive away and the hotel has a pool, a nice plus. There is a cost for breakfast, served in the attached restaurant, although guests get a 10% discount. We don't mind paying for a breakfast because generally better than the breakfasts one doesn't pay for.",July 2015,Days Inn & Conference Centre Renfrew,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g182180-d183007-Reviews-Days_Inn_Conference_Centre_Renfrew-Renfrew_Ontario.html,"Renfrew, Canada",hotels,4.0,3.0
"If you are in White Lake, go here for dinner!","Had dinner here. Great pasta dishes, with dishes to chose from if you are vegetarian. Indoor and patio service overlooking White Lake. Price reasonable and service very friendly. We couldn't have chosen a better place to eat and next time we are in the area, we would return. My husband said his penne dish was the best he ever had. Good deserts too and restaurant is licensed.",July 2015,Cedar Cove Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3369711-d5313614-Reviews-Cedar_Cove_Resort-White_Lake_Ontario.html,"White Lake, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Delightful place to stay,"We stayed here for two nights at Christmas while waiting for our cottage to become vacate. And on Christmas night, a joy to hear from our suite the church bells chime Christmas carols. Very peaceful. Our suite was very clean, comfortable, well-equipped, and nicely decorated. Had we been aware of the lay-out of Sunrise Garden and/or booked sooner, we would have asked for a ground floor suite. Difficult to carry our luggage up the stairs and our outdoor sitting arrangement was not the best. The downstairs suites, however, had lovely outdoor areas amid the beautiful gardens. So if you book, ask for a ground floor suite if any are available. The resort is located in a quiet area within fairly easy walking distance of the shops and restaurants and the pier. Parking and a pool are available. Because we arrived on Christmas Day, staff, at our request, provided us with some minimal groceries from a list I had provided them by email. We would definitely stay here again.",December 2014,Sunrise Garden Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29166-d459997-Reviews-Sunrise_Garden_Resort-Anna_Maria_Anna_Maria_Island_Florida.html,"Anna Maria Island, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.5

Would definitely return.,"When you come from the north and don't want to fight the traffic into and out of Toronto, especially in the winter, the Comfort Inn in Newmarket is a great place to stay. The GO Bus Terminal is close enough by with plenty of free parking and buses regularly leave for Toronto and return to Newmarket. (Takes about an hour.) We stayed here recently when we came from further north to attend the Bob Dylan concert at the Sony Centre in Toronto, a block from the Toronto Go Station. This Comfort Inn is also close to the hospital and Upper Canada Mall for some terrific shopping

It is a typical Comfort Inn with all the amenities Comfort Inns provide. We especially like the ground floor rooms with parking right outside the room. Beds are comfortable and rooms are clean and well-appointed. (As I have said about other Comfort Inns, the patio doors are hard to open and close without some strength and despite extensive renovations at Comfort Inns, this still seems to be an issue.) Staff is very friendly and helpful at this particular Comfort Inn and good staff makes all the difference in the world.",November 2014,Comfort Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g181744-d182910-Reviews-Comfort_Inn-Newmarket_Ontario.html,"Newmarket, Canada",hotels,4.0,4.0
Truly Amazing.,"We had a truly wonderful experience at this lodge, so well located with wildebeests and zebras practically outside the balcony of our beautiful and comfortable chalet. The chalets and the lodge are beautifully decorated. We had two game drives daily with the noble and knowledgeable Amos. Coffee in tin cups for the early morning drives and wine, beer or soft drinks for the evening sundowners. Great food and lots of it, with true vegetarian meals offered. The staff was very warm and welcoming. A special thanks to Maggy, Amos and the chef. We couldn't have had a better time anywhere in the world.",October 2014,Hanglip Mountain Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g471866-d1142633-Reviews-Hanglip_Mountain_Lodge-Entabeni_Game_Reserve_Waterberg_Limpopo_Province.html,"Entabeni Game Reserve, South Africa",hotels,5.0,4.5
One Great Experience!,"Fantastic game drives twice daily - three hours in the early morning and three hours in late afternoon. We saw every animal we hoped to see, except the leopard. But that didn't matter because we saw so many magnificent animals. The velds and the mountains and the light of the early morning and late afternoon at the beginning of their spring were something that will remain part of our vision forever. Our Lakeside Lodge chalet was beautiful and spacious - high ceilings, large bathroom, comfortable bed and a small balcony/verandah facing the lake. Lots of food at all three daily buffets, although dinners were hard for us because we are vegetarian and dinners consisted mostly of just vegetables. That is the only thing that could be improved at Lakeside. The staff were warm, welcoming and accommodating. I cannot say enough about them. Special thanks to Lindi and Eric, our game drivers. They went beyond the call of duty!",October 2014,Entabeni Lakeside Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g471866-d471998-Reviews-Entabeni_Lakeside_Lodge-Entabeni_Game_Reserve_Waterberg_Limpopo_Province.html,"Entabeni Game Reserve, South Africa",hotels,5.0,4.5
The Most Welcoming Staff Ever!,"I rate it an excellent hotel because of the very welcoming and helpful staff and the complimentary shuttle service to and from the airport. Location for airport travel is excellent. Takes only a very short while to get to the airport. The rooms are small, but they are very clean with all the necessary amenities and the bed is comfortable. No restaurants nearby, but you can order pizza.

Penguins are a Must-See!,"A must if you want to see these delightful penguins whose numbers are dwindling. Vendors along road to the beach if you want to do some shopping.

A Canada Day Getaway,"We spent two nights at the very economical San-Man Motel over the Canada Day. The owners are very welcoming and friendly. Rooms are basic, but spotless. It is on the highway and not right in Port Perry, but we didn't mind that as Port Perry is only minutes away and the motel is far enough off the highway that traffic is not a great issue. We made use of the picnic table, as well as the outdoor electrical plug at the side of the motel, to cook dinner one of the evenings and spent a marvellous evening with friends cooking and chatting and eating from early evening until the sun set. It was a wonderful way to spend Canada Day. We are seriously thinking of returning next year. Port Perry itself is a great town with wonderful shopping and beautiful preserved homes and buildings.",July 2014,San-Man Motel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g796989-d2027215-Reviews-San_Man_Motel-Port_Perry_Ontario.html,"Port Perry, Canada",hotels,4.0,4.0

Simply Wonderful,"Wonderful float home B&B. There are two nicely furnished,clean and spacious bedrooms rooms with private bath and a gas fireplace. There is also a common sitting room and fully-stocked kitchen, with a fridge full of snacks and milk and juice. We had the Brunswick room with a patio on the Fraser River. After a day of walking, it was a delight to come back to the room and feel the warmth of the sun streaming through the windows of our room and even though it was October, when the sun shines, the late afternoon is the perfect time to sit and have a drink on the patio and watch the river go by. The sunsets from the patio and our room were stupendous. Jackie is a very pleasant and accommodating host.
