Plenty of WOW! but a few hms.,"Plenty of the wow factor you need/demand/expect from a high end resort but there are a couple of quibbles about the food.

Room: excellent. Clean, well equiped, superb view of the gardens.

Ambience: superb. A really well designed landscape with plenty of areas to just stroll or sit and enjoy the serene atmosphere.

Beach: lovely sandy beach with clean water for swimming and plenty of space.

Food: choice a bit limited, quality not bad - maybe not 5* standard - but there is a better restaurant upstairs and there was a Friday BBQ which was great. Nice breakfast with plenty of choice.

Service from Reception was a bit patchy.

Very nice restaurant,Very nice surroundings. Attentive staff. Varied menu. Prices a little higher than Lindos average but classier restaurant. Starters a bit average but the slow cooked pork belly was delicious. Excellent for post-Acropolis evening.,September 2016,Mavrikos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g227884-d1099457-Reviews-Mavrikos-Lindos_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Very good ruins,If you're staying anywhere near Lindos this is already on your list and is well worth it. The climb looks intimidating from the ground but isn't too arduous.

Excellent Greek restaurant,We found this in a tourist guide (not TA) and it was well worth seeking out. Charming and very atmospheric. The staff were very welcoming. Food excellent and reasonably priced. We both had the kleftico lamb - something of a house speciality - and it was flavoursome and filling. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would certainly go again.,September 2016,Mama Sofia's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635613-d1095693-Reviews-Mama_Sofia_s-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A fun little film,"A ""9D"" experience. Quite a lot of fun, just the right length and a good start for a visit to the Old Town. Staff a bit brusque.",September 2016,Throne of Helios,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635613-d6885488-Reviews-Throne_of_Helios-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Decent restaurant,Decent restaurant with okay food. Not expensive. Top level has stunning view of Lindos. Probably.
