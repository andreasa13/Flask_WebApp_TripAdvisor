We walked around down at the bottom and found a trail that takes you back to the Visitors Center. The trails are well marked and this one went straight up the cliffs. The sights on the way up and at the top are breathtaking, don't be afraid to take the trail if you have time. It's well maintained and there is room to stop and rest if you need to. You won't be sorry and you will truly appreciate how gorgeous this pace is.",November 2014,Giant's Causeway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g209948-d189773-Reviews-Giant_s_Causeway-Bushmills_County_Antrim_Northern_Ireland.html,"Bushmills, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very nice cafe and gift shop.,"After walking around the Causeway itself, this Visitor Center is a welcome place to stop and have lunch. It's big and bright and you could spend a couple of hours here easily.",November 2014,Giant's Causeway Visitor Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g209948-d2281662-Reviews-Giant_s_Causeway_Visitor_Centre-Bushmills_County_Antrim_Northern_Ireland.html,"Bushmills, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,3.5
Second time here and just as good.,"I stayed here last year and enjoyed it so on my trip this year we stayed here again. It was just as good as I remember, the rooms and the service and the restaurant. The hotel is clean and the beds are super comfortable. We had a room with three people, there were plenty of beds, and the bathrooms were well equipped with supplies for three. A great stay in a great hotel, again.",November 2014,Killarney Towers Hotel & Leisure Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186612-d214578-Reviews-Killarney_Towers_Hotel_Leisure_Centre-Killarney_County_Kerry.html,"Killarney, Ireland",hotels,5.0,4.5
Don't miss it!,"This little church has one of the funkiest crypt tours you will ever take. The hours are kind of odd, as in very few, but if you can time it out, take the tour. It's small and very old, the crypts are downstairs, I won't spoil the fun too much, because you have to see it yourself. It's the most fun 10 euros I spent!",November 2014,St. Michan's Church,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d214996-Reviews-St_Michan_s_Church-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
