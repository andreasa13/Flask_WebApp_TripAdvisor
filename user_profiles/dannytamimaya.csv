Should Have Been Better,"I have been walking past here for a few years , so I finally booked for a visit this year , after reading the great reviews on TripAdvisor, what a disappointing stay, the first room was on the lower floor , and everyone that walked past looked in , so we asked to move , we moved all our suitcases and went out for a few hours .
We ate supper in the hotel that night , I can only say it was disgusting, all full of oil , I ate a bread roll , on check out they refunded our half board status after asking for it for a few times .
On our return to our room after only after 10pm we found that the room they gave us the air con did not work , they then had to find us yet another room to sleep in .
This is 3 rooms in about 6 hours
Breakfast the next morning was not much better then supper , salad was not very fresh ,
We went out for the whole day only to return at 7 , to find that no one had bothered to clean the room ,
This hotel has a great views , has free parking
The wifi is not very strong
I don’t think the COVID points are very good , nothing in the room , no gel or masks.
Staff wear masks but most guest do not and no one asks them to put them on
This hotel is a maze of stairs , by the time you get to your room you have done a workout
I would never come back here and would not recommend it to anyone else",April 2021,Amphora Hotel & Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190384-d3878952-Reviews-Amphora_Hotel_Suites-Paphos_Paphos_District.html,"Paphos, Cyprus",hotels,2.0,4.0
Worst meal this year,"Worst meal this year , ordered chicken in sauce , yuck was so sweet could not even eat it , husband’s pasta was hard , salad was dried out when pointed out to manager he said I was wrong , but he would pass our comments on to the chef , big deal
The soup was ok
Go elsewhere

"Voucher from hotel , waste of time","Voucher from hotel , what a poor choice , I am used too a nice buffet in a hotel but this voucher was given to us , for me pure yuck , had a cup of tea and half a slice of bread , I don’t eat bread but healthy crackers of which they did not have , I eat cottage they did not have , no cream cheese , in fact all I had was the jam , what a total waste of time , now I need to find somewhere to eat , the food was all left on the table , never coming here again

Disgusting,"I booked this hotel for my daughter and her partner to stay in after their flight , what a big mistake this was , when they arrived after their 15 min walk from the airport , and finding no one working at the hotel , the room they received had not been cleaned from the last person , on trying to make contact with someone that worked there which was really hard to do , they finally made contact with the manager who turned up and gave them another room “sorry was not mentioned “ my daughter asked for a late check out , at the time this was agreed for 12 am ,
The next morning when she explained this to who ever was working in reception she was told she had to leave at 11, or the police would be called ,
This place is a joke , rooms left uncleared , rude staff ,
They should have just stayed in the airport over night and saved their £110.00 approx
Don’t ask for gluten free breakfast you will not get it
These are real pictures of their room at check in

Mini Break,"After reading all these glowing reviews I was expecting something wow , omg how wrong I was , as I sit by the pool in my last day here is my review of this hotel .
In check in very quick we were given a room in the 6th floor , it was made up with the sofa bed out , strange for just a couple , my husband pushed it back to find the carpet had not been cleaned , biscuits , hairs , etc , yuck . Quickly sorted out and given 15% off our bill nice touch
First nights meal yummy and hot 10 out of 10.
Pool very clean the next morning
Breakfast good
That’s were it ends
Lunch think of bad school dinners cold and yucky , that was lunch on Wednesday , so we went to the pool bar , see picture of hamburger , omg looks like dog meat
So we stuck to drinks , I don’t speak very good Hebrew but I try and all 3 bar men made fun of me, in front of a bar full of people , how rude I was fuming , their English should be as good as my Hebrew
Supper yucky the meat was raw thought it would jump off my plate
Breakfast again , we came down 35 mins after it opened to find the eggs ice cold , the pies ice cold and raw inside ,
To sum it up would we come here again , don’t think so
Entertainment , children’s until 9.40 last night then bingo , very disappointed all round
Only one bar
Beer only in dining room if you want wine only at the bar and that is not open at lunch times ,
Did not see any ice cream only ice lollies",September 2020,Isrotel Lagoona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293980-d319657-Reviews-Isrotel_Lagoona-Eilat_Southern_District.html,"Eilat, Israel",hotels,3.0,5.0
First Time Disappointing,"My husband bought these tickets through the supermarket at a special discount price , so we thought why not , wow we queued up for ages , badly signed we had no idea if we were in the right queue as other cars were cutting us up.
So many cars speeding through the safari, kids hanging out of windows with no care of safety, again badly sign posted if you were going the right way, we saw one worker on her tractor .
Half way you can park and can to the zoo, not explained to you at the entrance , so we went in too many people not sticking to health and safety guidelines , so many people , no masks , and they did not care when it was pointed out to them we left after 10 minutes along with other people , back in the car we had a long wait to see 4 or 5 poor lions under a tree,
Would I return , no, would I pay the real price , no way it’s madness ,they need to stick to health guidelines too many people in one place in the zoo , not good , not clean at all
Should not allow people in without masks .
Black mark against them big time . Big time money making scheme .",August 2020,Ramat Gan Safari,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297761-d325271-Reviews-Ramat_Gan_Safari-Ramat_Gan_Tel_Aviv_District.html,"Ramat Gan, Israel",attractions,3.0,4.5
Rude Staff,"I needed to come to Jerusalem for the night so we decided on this hotel chain , the check in was ok , the room on the 22 floor was ok but very dated around 1970’s, but after we spent a hour at the pool which was spoilt by their very yucky choice in loud music , I went to have a shower only to find a very small bath towel with a blood mark in the middle , of course that put me off having a shower at that time , so I went to reception with the towel to explain and show him the mark , I was then explained in great detail how they wash their towels after listening I said I don’t care this marked yucky towel should not be put back into the rooms - no sorry was given to me - yeah a new towel would be sent , we went out 2.5 hours later no towel.
I went back to reception a new person explained again , again no sorry we will send u a new towel ,
This morning after having no sleep due to a large crowd outside with police until 1.30 we asked for a late check out until 12.30 so we could return to sleep after our meeting , we were met with someone dressed in shorts like he was going to the beach , he said no way as it was Friday , did not care we only got to sleep at around 2, because of the noise send we could have until 12 but was very rude about it .
Breakfast should be different in these days no helping yourself any more , this hotel has done nothing , good job we went early , afterwards in will be gross , not what the government guidelines have told them to do
Will not be back find a different hotel there are hundreds in this town
Someone’s food left out by the lift at 7.00am
Car park costs 40.00 nis per night

Youth Hostel or Hotel,"Is this place a hotel or a youth hostel I could not tell the difference .

We had to change our rooms 3 times they were so bad , in the beginning they wanted $50 per night up grade , no way.

Very Disappointing,"I read all the reviews about this hotel and I thought I had chosen a nice hotel for my daughter and myself for a long week-end break , this is my fourth visit to Paphos so I know the place, how wrong was I
Six months ago I asked for a high floor- on check in was given the ground floor , the room had 3 black hairs in the bathroom a big turn off for both of us , so they moved us to the third floor, the rooms are so hot you had to have the windows open all day, they gave us a fan, see picture, breakfast on first day was ok , lots of choice .
Until the bug...
The staff are rude , not helpful, yes we got wine and fruit and balloons for my daughters birthday , I would rather have a clean cool room .
We had a meeting for 9 am booked with the manager , he did not even bother to turn up . When we checked out I then got told very rudely that my credit card had been declined and I had to pay again , thank god I had the receipt .
The assistant manager pointed out I did not pay a lot !!!! I had credit to use up.
The gym is nice as is the pool
But if you like rude staff- dirty rooms-very hot rooms please book here
If you want happy staff, clean rooms and food with no bugs book elsewhere there are lots of hotels in this town .

Not Very Nice,"After reading all the reviews and staying there for 4, night I feel I must have stayed in a different hotel from all these reviews.
This hotel is very old, the entrance has been updated so has the breakfast room but that's it, the sign that's states this is a Best Western property was no where to be seen , the first room I was given was so small, I changed it for a triple room a bit more space , beds really old , pillows old , small TVs , only BBC news in English , air con did not work very well , room very cold , could hear everything from the other rooms , bathroom so tiny , and it was yucky.
Breakfast no big deal same food for all four mornings nothing changed very boring .
Lift really small and so slow.
Area was ok , I had seen worse in Athens , 5 mins walk from the station . Brand new hotel owned by the same people next door . They seemed to eat in our breakfast room .

Not want I expected,"My husband book this tour without my knowledge , we travel lots and go on lots of ""these free walking tours"" so a food one was a first for us, I wanted to cancel due to the bad weather I wish he had listened to me , when we met up we were a party of 6 adults one child we were asked about diets 2 of us were diabetic, (one of which is my husband) we were told the food would cost approx 11 euros and tour guide would pay and we would settle up at the end , I had no idea what she was talking about but my husband did , the walk was ok but we covered the same streets we had just done that morning so for us nothing new , took us for some dry bread , two of them 1 euro, then some coffee and pastries one of which very sweet , 40 mins later more food in a restaurant in the market which I would call cheap and nasty , I fish (I never eat that kind of fish ) one between six people , 4 meatballs that I thought was fish between 6 people , one plate of veg, one plate of greens like cabbage, the smallest plate of humus, dry bread a small bottle of booze , then tap water , never in my life would I enter a place like this in the middle of a smelly market place a work mans cafe , we finished off with more sweet cakes,
Thankfully the company was pleasing, but overall for 25 euros , I ate just cakes and drunk water and my husband did not really eat food to that value , don't forget to add the tip of the trip that's up to you how much you give , there are other trips out there that might suit your stomach more.

Great Day Out,"We went on a bus trip to a few places and the first place we stopped was here, they said we would be here for 3 hours and I thought , what is there to see for that amount of time, how wrong was I , the time just flew by and the views are amazing . First we climbed to the light house which is not too bad of a climb but take water it was a hot and windy day.
The walk down is a lot easier , there is a lift for a small fee.
There are seats along the route for a break
We got cold drinks at the bottom in the cafe
Took loads of pictures and just where amazed at the view , then you need to go and find the baboons or rather they find you and they did not disappoint , loads came out to play ,

Not Up To Standard of a Radisson,"After just leaving an amazing Radisson in Johannsburg , I thought this was going to be the same, oh was I so wrong , the first room was so old, the bed was way too soft( my husband woke up with a bad neck) the bathroom was old with cracks , stains on the carpet , two lights wired together so could not be used, just so yucky , I wanted to cry and leave - the next day after speaking to Angus the new manager who was very nice he gave us a very nice suite ( still very old) but at least we had room to move . The room was cleaned everyday day , but everyday something else was missed , sometimes no tea left, or no milk or no face towels , always something different , we stayed 5 nights.
I did not like the breakfast I felt but enough choice , one day no bread rolls, no cucumber , etc, no milk in coffee machine , if you only want bacon and eggs it's fine but not everyone does .
Did not use pool or spa

I agree with other comments about the problem with the hairdryer plus ours had tape all around it

Mixed - disappointing,"We checked with front desk a few days earlier to make sure we got the correct room so when we did check in and was given an old room on the 2nd floor I was very surprised , I had been carrying around a lovely picture of a updated room sent to me by Expedia , I went back downstairs and was told talk to Expedia nothing to do with them .we stayed the first night but after finding so many things wrong with the room my husband went to see the manager , we were then given the room as per my picture - bliss.

Been to these hotels before in Norway and they where great

Great Food and good prices,"We found this place before I saw the reviews on here, what a little gem, just what we needed for a late lunch, in fact it was so good we went there two days in a row.
We cold soup one day hot the next , salad and pasta and shared it between us, more than enough food.
The cocktails are good as well
The husband had the beers
Each day came to about £14.00 for both of us .
Would love to go back next time I am in the area",July 2018,Cegielnia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274812-d968332-Reviews-Cegielnia-Wroclaw_Lower_Silesia_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Wroclaw, Poland",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Mixed,"We stayed here for 2 nights while we visited friends in the area, we found an empty car park at the back. Left car and went into town by bus £4.50 all day ticket.
Our room was clean . Our bed was ok, yes TV is very small good job no match was on when we stayed .
Ok now to the good bit on our last day at 8.30 in the morning on the staircase we came across two people ""at it"" as I like to use the stairs this was not a pretty sight ,
We explained this to reception who then rushed upstairs to check with the young quickly running out of hotel , lady running off to her room.
Usually you only gain access with your key but this hotel was not, for this reason we will not use again, lack of security .
I have written a complaint to head office but have heard nothing , manager was not around to talk too and no one bothered even to ask our names .

Just perfect,"We only stayed for two nights , but they were perfect , we had a room in the top floor facing the lift of which I usually hate, but we did not hear anything. The room was an adapted room very large , with electric beds such a nice treat, tea and coffee and biscuits and fudge and free water in the room, plus mini bar. Our bathroom was very large with enough soaps + more to go around for two people .
Very clean hotel
Really large TV , no English channels, fast wifi
Really good breakfast
Old town across the road of which is lovely , you can walk to two big shopping malls

Very late night check in....,"We arrived after one am but only got to sleep around 3 am but house keeping decided to wake us up at 9.30, oh well we should have put the sign up !!!
Apart from that the bed was great, as a silver member got free drinks the next morning always a bonus, did not order breakfast, we went into town as our flight was at 6pm, bus stop right outside, came back a free hours later offered another round of drinks for the early wake up call , really nice touch before our flight. Been staying here for years and will carry on staying here before and after a flight .
Why bother driving home in the middle of the night .",May 2018,ibis London Luton Airport Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190747-d191491-Reviews-Ibis_London_Luton_Airport_Hotel-Luton_Bedfordshire_England.html,"Luton, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,3.5
Great,"My son has been coming here now for ages now via Groupon , and he finally bought coupons for the rest of us for birthdays treats . What a great 3 course meal we all had, my starter of smoked salmon was great worth every penny , the salads where amazing, everyone thought the starters were filling .
The main courses a mixture of steak and lamb no words can explain how good they where you need to try yourselves .
Then came the deserts , only one word Yummy.
Danny our server was great could not do enough for us

"Average, worst ever wifi","Last hotel on our trip to Shanghai and Hong Kong and after reading reviews how close this was to the metro (very important ) I picked this , big mistake with luggage , if you do not come out of the correct exit , of which is closed due to road works , with luggage it's a long walk on the busy roads and going over the over pass is not easy,
First room given which was listed as deluxe on the 20th floor old and dark asked to move and was given a new room on the 13th floor much nicer, yes you do hear all the doors banging when everyone comes in and goes out.
Shower a bit basic and small for a new room
Breakfast was nice enough
Had the buffet dinner one evening approx $30 each very nice
Last day they have a mini bus service to airport door to door approx $10 each I wish I had known about it before
Would I come back , no I would chose a much closer hotel to the metro and a newer one, this is a bit old
Staff very nice and helpful spoke English
Very bad wifi",April 2018,Hotel Equatorial Shanghai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g308272-d561838-Reviews-Hotel_Equatorial_Shanghai-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",hotels,3.0,4.0
Boring Mall,"The good points about this mall on a rainy day , it is attached to the metro station, lots of food outlets and a great supermarket downstairs .
The bad points, it is one of the most boring malls I have ever been in, floor after floor of shops with no one buying anything .
Go just for the food and to get out of the rain
On line 2, Zhongshan Park, the exit is where you see the food hall that's the ground floor of the mall",April 2018,Dream cloud nine Shopping Mall (changning),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g308272-d3362126-Reviews-Dream_cloud_nine_Shopping_Mall_changning-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",attractions,3.0,4.0
