Olympia Tour from Athens,"Day trip to Olympia. Bus was in excellent condition and on time. We arrived and returned on schedule.
What we didn't like was that the driver was speeding and didn't respect traffic laws. This might be a common thing in Greece, however it spoiled our trip. When we tried to discuss this with him, he rejected us in a not very polite way.",October 2019,Olympic Traveller,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189487-d4232608-Reviews-Olympic_Traveller-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",attractions,2.0,5.0
Mediocre,"We stayed for one night. Hosts were kind and the building is very new, however it's located in a dull and uninteresting suburb, with nothing around to pass the time.
Bathroom was not very clean and breakfast was nothing special, with few choices.",October 2019,Olygreen Athens Residences,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2618353-d19090519-Reviews-Olygreen_Athens_Residences-Cholargos_Attica.html,"Cholargos, Greece",hotels,2.0,4.5
