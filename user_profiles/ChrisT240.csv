View of the city,"Yes the history of this place is amazing but so is the view. We were told it is best to go first thing as it gets busy once the bus groups arrive. This was a good idea even though it was no where near as busy as it is in the summer months.

There is a great spot near the entrance to go and see lit up at night, another must do.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Terry knows his stuff,"Terry was our driver that picked us up at the airport on our first day in Athens. He was so helpful on that first day letting us know the sites to see and some of the history of Greece. He let us know about the excursions that his company offers and when we were returning to Athens from Santorini we called him and set up this tour for when we got back.

The trip was very amazing, Terry is a great person to take you around to the many sites. He would then give us an overview of where to go in the historical sites we visited and what we would see there, and also the history of the site.

This was a great trip especially if you are looking for something outside of the big city. We were never rushed to get out of the sites and also had plenty of time to explore Napfloi for lunch and shopping.",October 2019,One Day Peloponnese,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d15665283-One_Day_Peloponnese-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
Great little restaurant,"My wife and I were up visiting our son in his new place and found this on Trip Advisor.
The food here was amazing and the atmosphere was nice too. The staff were very helpful and the food was as described. I had the paella and it was a good size that filled me up and was delicious. My wife had the catch of the day and it was done as my wife asked as she has some nutritional restrictions. I can't remember what the kids had but I know they loved it and we all shared a shrimp cocktail and an order of fish tacos. I could have eaten the fish tacos as a meal as they were amazing.",June 2019,Merivale Fish Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155004-d781515-Reviews-Merivale_Fish_Market-Ottawa_Ontario.html,"Ottawa, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Something Different,"Great tour, thanks Rachel for everything. We have been coming to Halifax for a long time as we have family here and were looking for something new to do. I decide to book us on the Downtown tour and it didnâ€™t disappoint. We stopped at a total of 7 places and everyone one was very good. The walk was nicely broken up which was good since it was a very humid day. The amount of food you get adds up and by the end you are feel like you have eaten about a lunch sized meal. The history about the buildings we walked by and that the restaurants are in is very informative as well. I highly recommend this tour.",July 2018,Local Tasting Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154976-d3242898-Reviews-Local_Tasting_Tours-Halifax_Halifax_Regional_Municipality_Nova_Scotia.html,"Halifax, Canada",attractions,5.0,5.0
Anniversary Trip,"My wife and I were headed to New York for our 20th wedding anniversary trip and luckily enough got tickets to the Tonight Show. Great time and everything you read about the show is true. So arrive early like they say, don't bring any bags with you and just go to enjoy the show, the taping is only about an hour and a half. It doesn't matter who the guests are you are there for the experience and to see Jimmy Fallon and also the Roots. You can't take any photos in the theatre and they are quick to get people to put their phones away once they see you are on them, and they will see you on them.",September 2015,The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d6634084-Reviews-The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Jimmy_Fallon-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.5
Anniversary Trip,We were in New York for our anniversary and wanted to see a show but didn't buy any tickets ahead of time. We bought tickets the night before and got great seats front row of the balcony. Great show awesome theatre and great cast.

Best Food Cart in the city,"This food cart has the best ""street meat"" in the city. My wife comes to New York every year for work and has passed by this cart and notices there is always a lineup no matter what time of day. This being said we were in New York on our own and she recommended we try it.What a great choice we chose the combo platter which is a large container with lettuce, rice, lamb, pork, chicken, cheese and a piece of naan bread, and then you put on your choice of sauce, White sauce is sweet and red sauce is very hot. So good that we ate there twice in the short time we were there.",September 2015,53rd & 6th Halal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1204361-Reviews-53rd_6th_Halal-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Anniversary Trip,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel at probably the worst time of the year, however we were stuck because of the timeline of our flight. The week was when the Pope was in town, as well as the UN address, Thursday Night Football was in New York, both baseball teams were playing at home and there was a big concert at Central Park.That being said the hotel was perfectly located to subway stations or the 20 minute walk to Times Square and Broadway. The downfall was that the hotel was priced about 5 times higher than normal.

The staff are very friendly and super helpful. Only downfall was the price which again was way cheaper the next week.",September 2015,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New York City Chelsea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1214829-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_New_York_City_Chelsea-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,5.0,3.5

Not worth it,"We went to the new location off of Uteck. We were there with a group of around twenty for a birthday party. The party was booked early and the restaurant did a nice job of accommodating us all with plenty of room for our group. The atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice and the staff are very friendly. The disappointment is with the food, while the presentation is very nice the food isn't all that great. The portions are small and pretty much everyone left still hungry. My family if four spent around $60 for lunch and just drinking water and we had to stop on the way home to get something else to tide us over until dinner. Maybe it is just that they are new but I would not be returning or recommending this place to anyone.",August 2013,Morris East,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154976-d785000-Reviews-Morris_East-Halifax_Halifax_Regional_Municipality_Nova_Scotia.html,"Halifax, Canada",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Well worth it.,"I found out about this place by recommendation on trip advisor and it was bang on. Very relaxed atmosphere and great place for families. The kids meals are around $7 and the other main meals are from $12 to $15. I had the scallop burger and it was divine, $13 and comes with really good home cut fries. My wife had the fish taco and kids had fish and chips each of them were $12 and were just as good. The only downfall is their drinks are bottled pop and no refills and they cost $2.50 each.
They have a really nice patio and it is licensed. Great location with lots of parking and lots of room to sit and eat. I would definitely go back and recommend it to anyone staying near or passing through Cavendish.",August 2013,The Lost Anchor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g499311-d4457696-Reviews-The_Lost_Anchor-Cavendish_Prince_Edward_Island.html,"Cavendish, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Restaurant,"My wife and I were travelling home after dropping kids off at a friends cottage for the week in Bayfield. We then headed up to Goderich and hit up Trip Advisor for suggestions for dinner when we came across this one. We called ahead to see if reservations were needed and none were so we headed right there. Once there you will find a beautifully restored old home that has a very nice atmosphere and very welcoming and accommodating staff.
We were seated and told about the specials and left to look over the menu, and after a brief time our server came to see if we had any questions which she answered with ease. We started our dinner with the crab cakes and an order of bacon wrapped scallops. The scallops are to die for they are wrapped in maple bacon and then have a maple syrup glaze over them that is delicious. You get three scallops with the order and the crab cakes come with two which were also very good. For the main course I had the special of the night which was a shrimp curry with lime rice an papadums. My wife had what turned out to be the signature dish of the chef which was a soufflÃ© with goat cheese, roasted peppers, and spinach baked and then sliced in two and served with seasonal vegetables. For dessert we split the chocolate brownie.
The portions at this restaurant are perfectly sized and with an appetizer we were only able to share the dessert so not to be too stuffed. Your meal does come with complimentary bread that they keep refilling until the main meal came and we said we had enough. The staff is very accommodating and will even split anything you want onto your own plates if you are sharing. The price I found to be very reasonable for this quality of food and service our dinner came to just over $80 before tip and with no drinks.
This was a gem of a place and we would definitely return next time in the area.",August 2013,Thyme On 21 Casual Dining,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g609113-d766684-Reviews-Thyme_On_21_Casual_Dining-Goderich_Huron_County_Ontario.html,"Goderich, Canada",restaurants,5.0,5.0

Wow,"The dam was as amazing as you can expect. I suggest you get the full tour inside the dam like I did it gives you way more of a perspective of things. Our guide was very informative and funny. The group for the full tour is fairly small but be prepared they do cram you into an elevator to go down in the dam. When I say cram I mean packed in like sardines with no space to move. However the trip down takes only 70 seconds.
The reviews from other people is correct in saying that to get there before 10:30 or after 3 as the tours aren't as busy then. You are not allowed to bring any food or drink into the dam other than bottled water. There is food available at the restaurant in the parking garage next to the gift shop. We however packed a lunch and ate it in our car when we were done in the parking garage overlooking the dam.",September 2012,Hoover Dam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60881-d150546-Reviews-Hoover_Dam-Boulder_City_Nevada.html,"Boulder City, Nevada",attractions,5.0,4.5
Everything you would expect and then some!!!!!,"My wife and I booked this in advance as we are huge fans of all of Gordon Ramsay's shows and we were positive this was one thing we had to do. The meal didn't disappoint we each ordered to appetizers a main with a side and a dessert. The staff were awesome and even took the time to take some pictures of us together in the restaurant. For each section there are two people taking care of you so you a always taken care of and your drink is never below half full. The courses come at a nice staggered pace so you don't feel stuffed when the next course comes, you actually have time to taste your food before the next course comes. I started with the cesaer salad followed by the kobe beef sliders (which were divine) then the masterpiece beef wellington which is better than it looks on TV and finished off with the cheescake. What an amazing meal and worth every cent I can't wait to try it again.
