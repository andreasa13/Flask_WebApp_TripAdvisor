Great dinner on the Wharf,"I had a great Mixed Grill dinner with salmon, cod and shrimp. They know how to cook seafood and it was prepared perfectly. Fast service - from order to being served was less than 10 minutes. Really nice atmosphere with a great view of bay.",January 2020,Fog Harbor Fish House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d1047401-Reviews-Fog_Harbor_Fish_House-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Great location and nice rooms, but watch the hidden ""Resort Fee"" - $24 extra on top of your room rate","This is not a Sheraton property, but it used to be last year and will still show as a Sheraton with 3rd party booking sites. It is now an RIU which charges a $24 resort fee except they don't have a resort (spa or anything for your extra $$) The rooms were nice and the location is great for a walk around the wharf, cable cars, Alcatraz, etc... Parking is ridiculous at $72 per night so park across the street for $36. The front desk seems understaffed as we waited over 15 minutes to check in with only a couple people on staff.",January 2020,Hotel Riu Plaza Fishermanâ€™s Wharf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81375-Reviews-Hotel_Riu_Plaza_Fisherman_s_Wharf-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",hotels,3.0,3.5
Walk back through the centuries and wear comfortable shoes,"I know...who really needs another review of something this familiar? But I must say that It's absolutely a spectacular day walking around the Acropolis and being so close to history. I prefer to walk the whole day, but you can get a taxi ride very close to the entrance of the Acropolis (taxi ripoff alert). You must buy a pass to get inside the Acropolis, so I purchased the combined ticket which costs 30 Euro to get inside the Acropolis, but it also gets you into the Ancient Agora, Temple of Zeus, etc... It's worth the extra 10 Euros.

The terrain is steep and uneven in places, so wear comfortable shoes. Especially on top of the Areopagus Hill which has a very smooth, slippery surface at the top. I can't stress enough that you need good walking, running or hiking shoes around the area..

I recommend taking the short walk from the Acropolis up the Filopappou Hill up past Socrates Prison to the Monument of Philopappos to get a fantastic view of the Acropolis and the city of Athens.

I ate dinner overlooking the Acropolis and will never forget it.",December 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Good location, nice clean rooms, okay breakfast","Very clean and nice hotel centrally located in Markham. It has a nice lobby with a cool bar area to hang out with colleagues. The breakfast is $15 for a basic selection and we had to be waited upon by a single server. It just took too long to be served. As a business traveler, I would prefer a complimentary breakfast buffet (fast and free) which is available at other hotels.",November 2019,Hilton Toronto / Markham Suites Conference Centre & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g181720-d182903-Reviews-Hilton_Toronto_Markham_Suites_Conference_Centre_Spa-Markham_Ontario.html,"Markham, Canada",hotels,4.0,4.0
Great beachside park with direct river access,This place has a great playground for kids and you can fish off the pier on the river. There is limited parking but it's usually not a problem.,March 2019,Ryckman Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34434-d3337639-Reviews-Ryckman_Park-Melbourne_Beach_Brevard_County_Florida.html,"Melbourne Beach, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.5
