A very different Vegan experience....,"A very different Vegan experience....

It’s not your typical vegetarian restaurant, it’s not trying to save the planet, nor is it filled with self-righteous people eating vegetables. This is a place where the chef makes a real effort to transform basic vegetables into a gourmet experience. I actually loved how I didn’t know what was coming next, and I didn’t know what to expect over many courses. It was fun, it was an adventure (albeit an expensive one), but well worth it.

An amazing find!,"I loved the attention to detail in this hotel, in all parts of it. There is something unique going on here, there is an actual feeling you get being transported to another time, yet still remaining very much 21st century NYC.

It is a beautifully appointed room, filled with amenities, comforts, and luxury. Superbly comfortable bed, wonderful bathroom (that has to be one of the best showers in a hotel), soft and large towels, top of the line products, and overall a sense of comfort.

We stayed in this area to be close to our daughter who lives nearby, but no matter what, I would still return.

"Great location, huge rooms, a little tired...","The location of this hotel is really outstanding. If you need to be in midtown and at a distance from the madness of Times Square, this is a great option.

I think the rooms are a little tired, but they are so large that it makes up for the look. I’d love to see what the hotel will look like when the rooms get an upgrade.

Good gym, even while it was all under construction.

Just a really nice boutique hotel,"You can’t beat the location if you want a short getaway to Tel Aviv. My wife and I had a wonderful stay, just one night, but more would have been good too. I really liked the room we chose, large and with a balcony, very comfortable, and just a nice warm feeling.

It’s a small hotel, charming, clean, exceptional staff, and a nice place to stay.

It would have been nice if the breakfast was Kosher, but you can’t have everything, and since they are right next to one of my favorite (Kosher) steak places in Tel Aviv, I can’t really complain.",November 2019,Fabric Hotel Tel Aviv - an Atlas Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293984-d14416788-Reviews-Fabric_Hotel_Tel_Aviv_an_Atlas_Boutique_Hotel-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html,"Tel Aviv, Israel",hotels,5.0,5.0
Tiny but nice...,"Cute hotel in an area I needed to stay in. The room is very minuscule, well-appointed, but it is not big enough for more than one person, and should you have a large suitcase, such as I did, the room was really too small for one person.

The decor is nice, it’s a funky vibe, no lobby, no real place to sit or meet people, and it was fine. For a 2-night stay it was okay, certainly very clean and the room was nice, but its tiny size would make me reconsider going again.

They certainly try hard and the service is excellent, but I would have preferred more room to breath.",September 2019,"The Standard, East Village",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1149402-Reviews-The_Standard_East_Village-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,3.0,4.5

Very nice hotel,"This is a very large and very clean and very well located hotel. It’s a short walk to the centre of the city, but far enough for there to be less noise and traffic. I thought the location was perfect.

The greatest feature of the hotel is its staff, extremely courteous and service oriented. They were able to look after all that was required and did so with a smile and warmth. They made my stay very pleasant and enjoyable.

The roof-top pool area is a great feature and it was a great spot to sit and relax after a busy day. It has a nice bar too.

The rooms were adequate, rather small but sufficient for my needs.

Everything was extremely clean and in order.

Fantastic Weekend Getaway,"A 2 night stay felt like a long, relaxing holiday. This is a great resort, the renovations are very well done, the details are impressive, and the attention to detail made all the difference. I highly recommend this hotel and have been telling my friends and family to pay it a visit.

The pool area is a highlight, the grounds are vast and expansive, filled with delights for kids and families alike.

The meals over Shabbat were outstanding, great food, beautiful presentation, plentiful, tasty, and with a good variety.

The room was super comfortable and spacious. Great bed!

Room is adequate. Hotel experience = Zero,"This is a property with a collection of rooms. It is not truly a hotel. I shall explain:

- there are no common areas other than a small lobby with no where to sit
- there is no business center - I had to use the hotel’s computer at the front desk to print something
- there is no place to make a private call outside of the bedroom
- there’s no ambience, it akin to an apartment building and not a hotel

If the response to these notes is the fact there’s an adjacent restaurant and a rooftop patio, then the hotel management is missing the point. My dietary restrictions make the restaurant unusable and therefore irrelevant and a rooftop bar is not conducive to a meeting or just a place to talk to someone. Additionally, they are not features of the property, they are simply other spaces used in the building.

As for the room, there are some oddities:
- there is no coffee in the room
- there’s an enormous bathroom with no place to put anything
- there is limited space for your clothing
- wifi could be a lot better
- no pad of paper or pen to write something down
- and other odd design elements making the stay in the room rather clumsy

Good location. And it’s clean.

I cannot comment on service because there is nothing to serve. It was a disappointment. If you need a place to stay in that part of the city and require a bed then this is a fine choice. If you enjoy a hotel experience you will be utterly disappointed.",June 2019,Mondrian Park Avenue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d12845266-Reviews-Mondrian_Park_Avenue-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,1.0,4.5

The hotel provides excellent service, the staff were uniformly pleasant, courteous, and helpful.

The location is fantastic. If you do not need to be in central London, you are still a short walk to the tube station on the Central Line, this is most convenient, and a nice 20 minute walk along Hyde Park to arrive at the centre of Oxford Street. Even getting to the City for meetings was easy.

It’s good but not wow,"This is a very large hotel in a great location. The rooms have wonderful views of the sea and the beautiful city. The service is very good and the staff is responsive. But Tel Aviv is not just any city, it is a magical place that attracts visitors from all over the world, and the hotel simply doesn’t have a wow factor.

A world class gem,"I have visited this museum many times, but it is the most recent visit where I took in the scope and breadth of the museum in a different light. Heading to the museum with friends to see some of the temporary exhibits, I wandered off into the permanent art collection and was gobsmacked. I did not expect to see the extensive collection of impressionist art, nor did I expect to see some fascinating works by Picasso. And I only highlight a few examples of the collection. The quality of the art is at a world scale. You would not expect to see that in Jerusalem, but you do!!!

And this is only part of the museum, there is so much to pore over, and the collections are so well presented that you do not feel overwhelmed.

The current exhibits did meet up to the ""wow factor"" you read about. Did I know that Freud had a collection of rings designed from ancient coins? A secret society of rings, who knew?

The actual signature of Rambam!!! WOW!!!

Nice enough BUT...,"I am frequently staying in Toronto hotels and I would not say this is 5-Star quality. Unfortunately I had a very disappointing experience.

I had a very distressing experience with my room, but after my very firm complaint it was dealt with promptly. Nevertheless, none of this would have occurred if some very basic questions would have been asked upon check-in. Furthermore, the fact that the hotel was extremely late giving me my key (5;00 PM- why?), there was insufficient time and things were rushed. I get it that hotels are busy, but the delivery time of the room is not what I expected. I didn't have time to change for dinner...and then came another disappointment...

I pre-arranged a special meal for dinner. This was confirmed, and re-confirmed. Yet lo an behold, it was not there. Yes they made accommodations, but it's impossible to understand how this got missed. I was not happy...

At all times, the response from the hotel was ""I am sorry"". Although courteous, it's rather meaningless. And when I hear those words repeated time and time again, it becomes rather aggravating.

The room was nice, but not 5-Star, sorry. Why no plug for the phone near the bed? If it's a 1-bedroom suite, why do I have to go to the next room to control things? Rather odd.

Decor was fine, but more like a 4-Star than a 5-Star. I didn't get an ""experience"". It was fine, clean, nice, but no particular wow factor.

Other small irritants, met of course with an ""I am sorry"", made me feel as though the well-meaning staff were well-trained, but it's a rather empty statement. It made me feel like I was being the difficult guest...

I suggest that the management of this hotel check out their competitors, namely The Hazelton, if they wish to see what a 5-star experience should be in Toronto.

If The Ned is not a 5 STAR hotel, then what is?

Sophisticated, worldly, classy, yet very approachable. This is a hotel with an outstanding vibe, the lobby buzzes with action as the place to be, and is the essence of The City of London.

The facilities in this hotel are outstanding; the roof terrace, the gym facilities, the myriad of restaurants, and excellent service.

The room was sophisticated and made you feel that you are in the greatest city in the world. Every need was thought of, the vast products in the washroom set the gold standard for what a hotel should offer its guests. Thank you!

It was also very easy to accommodate my gluten-free and other allergy requirements.",June 2018,Maple Grill Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154943-d1990374-Reviews-Maple_Grill_Restaurant-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Great hotel,"What distinguishes this hotel is its newness as well as taking an otherwise standard room size and typical building configuration and transforming it into quality spaces.

My son and I stayed in a double queen room and I was very happy. The decor is contemporary and pleasing, the washroom is quite large and well laid out.

Location is great.

Excellent concierge.

Casino is nice.

Very happy with my stay at The Douglas!",June 2018,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g154943-d12619583-Reviews-The_DOUGLAS_Autograph_Collection-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver, Canada",hotels,4.0,4.5
Passover Perfection,"9 nights in this outstanding hotel gave me ample time to review it and to see if there are any flaws and my conclusion; they are hard to find!

The architecture of this property impresses from the moment you arrive. Its grand entrance welcomes you and embraces you with a distinct feel of Jerusalem that is felt throughout this beautiful hotel. We loved our rooms and found them spacious, comfortable, and well appointed.

The service is superb! Kudos to Jason Gardner and his team for a superb Passover Seder meal as well as all meals we shared as a family. Israeli breakfasts are legendary, this hotel shines in that category as well.

The elegance and ambience rate this hotel a 5!

The hotel staff is extremely adept at all service requirements. Service is given with a smile and a kind word.

I appreciated the little touches as well, such as the snacks and drinks upon check-in, the daily little gifts of dried fruit or chocolates or some other treat, the daily newspaper delivery, the glass water bottles replenished every day, and the parting gift from the hotel.

I highly recommend this incredible hotel!!",April 2018,Orient Isrotel Exclusive Collection Jerusalem,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293983-d12188417-Reviews-Orient_Isrotel_Exclusive_Collection_Jerusalem-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",hotels,5.0,4.5
Spectacular!!!,"Perhaps one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at! Spectacular is what comes to mind as the proper way to describe this outstanding property.

It's truly unique, the essence of the dessert captivates every spot in this hotel. The views, the room, the spa treatments, the food, the decor, all of it works together to capture the beauty of the dessert.

I often critique hotel rooms with the question, ""why would they do it this way?"" At Beresheet, I found everything about the room to be so well thought out, spacious, comfortable, and added to the overall zen atmosphere. Even the bath products are special.

I found the food outstanding! Special mention to Chef Asaf Cohen who delighted me with his creations including specially made deserts to accommodate my diet (gluten-free and egg free), The dinner menu included so many delicious options and I found the portions to be just right. The entire staff was excellent too.

Even though the weather was horrible, I found it to be a fantastic experience and I cannot wait to return.

Thank you for such a wonderful short holiday!!!",December 2017,Beresheet Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g303968-d2153495-Reviews-Beresheet_Hotel-Mitspe_Ramon_Southern_District.html,"Mitspe Ramon, Israel",hotels,5.0,4.5
Loved it!!!! Loved it!!!,"When my kids let me know that they purchased a session at The Workshop, I smiled without even knowing much about the experience. And I was not disappointed!

Our hosts were great, hospital, friendly, warm, and engaging, and they guided us through the whole process, from A-Z, and made me feel very confident even though I have zero experience with woodworking.

I found the entire experience very enjoyable and also quite therapeutic. I got to work with my hands and use my mind, I got to explore doing something completely new, and it just simply felt good.

In the end I had something physical to show and look forward to using the dreydel over Chanukkah.

I really recommend this experience! It was simply GREAT!!!",December 2017,The Workshop Gush Etzion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g7290659-d12637571-Reviews-The_Workshop_Gush_Etzion-Gush_Etzion_West_Bank.html,"Gush Etzion, Palestinian Territories",attractions,5.0,5.0
EXCELLENT,"The venue has gone though several iterations over the years and keeps on improving and always maintaining a distinct Jerusalem feel.

The food is simply excellent. The menu offers an exciting mix of flavours and options but doesn't overwhelm. The presentation of the plates is very appealing only enhancing the delicious mix of flavours.

Excellent wine list.

Great staff.

Cool vibe.

This is simply an excellent restaurant. Don't miss it!",December 2017,Anna Italian Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293983-d10459709-Reviews-Anna_Italian_Cafe-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Loved it,"I found the restaurant from Trip Advisor (thanks) and thought we'd give it a try. The drive into the restaurant property set the mood, rustic and kind of cool. We loved the ambiance.

The menu is excellent and the food was great. The trout was very fresh, tasty, with a great assortment of salads to accompany it. We were extremely happy.

I highly recommend it and look forward to a return visit.

Well done!",November 2017,Dag Al HaDan Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303970-d1116178-Reviews-Dag_Al_HaDan_Restaurant-Qiryat_Shemona_Northern_District.html,"Qiryat Shemona, Israel",restaurants,5.0,4.0

My return stay was even better!,"This hotel property is magnificent! The facilities are excellent. The meals, particularly on Shabbat, are extraordinary, delicious, and spectacular!

Although extremely busy, check-in was quick and flawless.

The renovated rooms in the main building are bright, modern, comfortable, and decent size for a beach front hotel. The renovations are really well done.

The hotel is full over Shabbat but never overwhelming. The Shabbat meals were at the highest level and perhaps the best I've ever had in Israel (and I've been to scores of hotels in Israel). Excellent variety, beautifully presented, and extremely tasty! 10/10!

The property feels like an oasis. The pool is beautiful. The hammocks are fun. The staff is attentive. Everything is very clean and well maintained. The exercise facilities are fantastic.

Truly a wonderful hotel (and I'm super picky!)

Great restaurant!,"The setting of the restaurant in Kikar HaMusica is a great venue. As someone with a lot of food allergies I was thrilled to have such a great meal. The gluten free pasta used in their pasta special was great, red tuna sauce. Yumm!

Regal,"Just a weekend away and it was wonderful...it was a great Shabbat, elegant service and wonderful food. The ambiance and splendour of the hotel adds to the charm and elegance and peaceful Shabbat. We had several rooms and they were each special. We booked last minute and were not able to get rooms facing the Old City, so I look forward to the next stay...

Expensive & Disappointing,"For the price I expected more. The large room appeared that it was due for a makeover some 5 years ago. It was clean and well-kept, but extremely out-of-date. It was brown, dark, and drab.

I chose not to stay in a theme room, but had to deal with the tackiness of the frigidly cold corridors resplendent in cowboy motif. But why?

Service was okay but not at a level that accords to the price per room.

Beds were fine.

Room temperature was exceptionally difficult to control and is in dire need of updating. Anyone ever heard of 21st century technology?

My rating: desperately in need of improvement.",August 2017,Fantasyland Hotel & Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g154914-d155540-Reviews-Fantasyland_Hotel_Resort-Edmonton_Alberta.html,"Edmonton, Canada",hotels,2.0,4.0
