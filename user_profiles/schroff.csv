Chef Glen organised to cook nice healthy meals as per our taste and requirement during our last two days of stay. Restaurant Manager Ananda has been good to provide quick and prompt services at the restaurant. Waiting time during the breakfast has been too long and adequate social distancing has not been maintained during the breakfast due to very congested space in Village Square area.

Resident Manager Mandira has been an excellent host as overall she looks after the guests very well during the entire stay. Spa Chief Dr. Sunil provided us daily morning Yoga lessons, which we enjoyed. Gym Instructor has been very nice to explain the various exercises to maintain good health.
