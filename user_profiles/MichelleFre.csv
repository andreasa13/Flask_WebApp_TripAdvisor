Underwhelming,Not the most organised place of interest for tourists to visit as individuals not on a tour. Cable car ride to top was good with no long queues as we arrived first thing in the morning. Not enough information on how to deal with the local monkeys jumping on your back without warning! This unfortunately happened to me within minutes of exiting the cable car which certainly put a damper on my visit as I spent the rest of my visit terrified another monkey would do the same. A nearby staff member removed the monkey and instructed people to wear their backpacks on their front. Information giving you directions around the sight and the various walking trails down from the summit was minimal and areas of interest underwhelming. The weather however was favourable and allowed great views in all directions. Sorry to say it’s a place I can say I’ve been to and don’t need to return.,September 2019,The Rock of Gibraltar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187510-d232389-Reviews-The_Rock_of_Gibraltar-Gibraltar.html,Gibraltar,attractions,3.0,4.5
