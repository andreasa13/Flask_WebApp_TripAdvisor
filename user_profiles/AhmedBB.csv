3 star quality & service at a 3 star price; good location but everything else mediocre,"The location of the property is beautiful. Pity that they have successfully turned it into a mismanaged B&B

Housekeeping is friendly, but seem to be really understaffed. Although room cleaning was delayed, the manager came to apologize but you could sense how desperately he was trying to keep everything in order with a small team - the visit was really appreciated

Mismanagement at its worst / not sure how this hotel passes as a 5 star:
- No one takes complaints seriously which is a pity when you have such a beautiful property
- Air-conditioning throughout our stay couldn't be fixed (came 4 times, made excused, lied and walked away)
- All bookings for breakfast, etc were confirmed by reception but not to restaurant
- Massages were confirmed but not booked
- In-room dining was cold (property size is huge but then don't offer in room dining)
- extremely uncomfortable beds / they really need to invest in quality bedding",July 2020,The Cove Rotana Resort Ras Al Khaimah,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298063-d1236752-Reviews-The_Cove_Rotana_Resort_Ras_Al_Khaimah-Ras_Al_Khaimah_Emirate_of_Ras_Al_Khaimah.html,"Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates",hotels,2.0,4.0
A Gem hidden in the desert!,"The entire 1200+ acre property only has Villa accommodation therefore, is not packed with guests. We had booked the Rimal pool villa for two weeknights! Having stayed at the same property when it was the Banyan tree Wadi resort, there are significant changes that we notices; good as well as bad!

The hotel staff: Absolutely brilliant! Right from our first impressions of being greeted while getting out of our Car (Mr. Zubair) and then at check-in (Mr. Mohammad). Zubair gave us a short but useful tour of the property along with food and activity recommendations which were very useful. The buggy rides with Amr and especially Jeff were always pleasant - they asked about our plans for the day and arrived on time. They always made an effort to ensure that they they could do their bit to make our stay as pleasant as possible! Staff coordination was impeccable; they managed to inform restaurants, activity centers and everywhere else that we were on the way and we were greeted with first name everywhere (even if it is communicated, it felt really special).

Spa: Apparently, the hotel has the largest spa in the region but frankly speaking, we were quite disappointed. We had booked a couples massage this time and also during the Banyan tree days. Comparing to other (much lower starred hotels in in the UAE), we felt that the whole spa experience was 'Mediocre' to say the least. It felt very unwelcoming (from the Spa reception to the message rooms), almost too industrial / robotic. The Massage was also not a relaxing experience at all! Wouldn't recommend it at all!

The Villa: The Villa (although, outdated) was fabulous with a private pool overlooking into the desert! While the hotel claims that its totally private and no guests or staff will be seen across in the desert, however, we did see guests strolling in front of the pools in the desert! The gazelles and Oryx walk up to the pools which is a great experience. The pool is heated and cooled which is a great plus for a private pool [takes 3 hours to change temp so worth planning in advance / you can also inform the hotel ahead of your arrival time on what temp to set for the pool]. The Bathroom / toilets are clean and kept well with a standing shower and a large bathtub!

Restaurants: Overall, staff at the restaurants is amazing, pleasant and very attentive! The breakfast at Kaheela was great with most dietary options available & most eggs / desert options being prepared to preference (no buffet due to covid which was great) . We ordered in-room lunches, Dinners at the Farmhouse as well as Moorish and moon bar for drinks! Nothing disappointed which is great improvement from the Banyan tree where most food options were average!

Activities: Since the hotel itself is a Nature wildlife reserve, it offers a lot of activities within the hotel boundary. We only opted for a desert exploration drive on a Polaris buggy with feeding the Oryx. Our guide was pleasant and knowledgeable which left a lasting experience that we take back with us!

Overall:
Staff (10/10): Absolutely brilliant
Spa (3/10): Mediocre leaning towards below-standard
Accommodation (7/10): Would have been better if there was complete privacy at the pool
Restaurants and Dining (8/10): Overall great with the exception of having items listed but not available
Activities (9/10): Multiple options with great staff",February 2021,"The Ritz-Carlton, Ras Al Khaimah, Al Wadi Desert",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298063-d1634438-Reviews-The_Ritz_Carlton_Ras_Al_Khaimah_Al_Wadi_Desert-Ras_Al_Khaimah_Emirate_of_Ras_Al_Khaima.html,"Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,4.5
Highlight of our Cape Town trip,"It’s a 4 hour ‘experience my that is definitely worth the money. We opted for the premium wines pairing option (forgot what it’s called). It is a tapas styled gastronomy concept starting with a journey along a map! Fusion cuisines from around the world leave your pallet craving more.. A total of about 16 courses and each was a divine work of art which tasted fabulous! I’ve lived in dubai all my life and dubai doesn’t have a shortage of fine dining but THIS was an experience like no other! The team is absolutely brilliant .. the gentleman at the door was amazing .. realized we were a little (maybe more than a little) drunk and made sure we got into our uber, noted the registration number of the car to make sure we got to our hotel safely!! Thank you sooo much especially to you and the teams for a wonderful experience!",April 2020,The Test Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6776544-d2062849-Reviews-The_Test_Kitchen-Woodstock_Western_Cape.html,"Woodstock, South Africa",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Outlived it’s days!,"The hotel, including its facilities is outdated and the staff is clearly used to hearing (and ignoring) complaints! It reminded me of a 3 star hotel I stayed at in china.. here as well there is a price tag for everything. Understandable, that the hotel was empty during the COVID19 scare but it shouldn’t take a toll on the few guests staying!

Warm water shuts off, bathroom were DISGUSTING.. showed it to housekeeping and they promised me that it will be cleaned only to disappear and not return. The SPA again, was a mediocre experience at best and not at all a reflection from a hotel that calls itself a ‘hotel & spa’. Reception was useless, unfriendly and clearly on target for upselling. Before you decide to judge, please read my other hotel reviews - most have been positive and very appreciative - will never stay here again and I would recommend the same to anyone else visiting Cape Town! Cape Town is a beautiful city with amazing people.. There are many other hotels that do justice to the beauty of the city and it’s people .. please stay there instead!

This was undoubtedly the worst hotel during our SA trip!",March 2020,The Twelve Apostles Hotel and Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312658-d507295-Reviews-The_Twelve_Apostles_Hotel_and_Spa-Camps_Bay_Western_Cape.html,"Camps Bay, South Africa",hotels,1.0,4.5

Boutique hotel with all the flair!,"The Thatch House is a beautiful boutique hotel located on the Klein River Lagoon! The hotel only has 6 rooms and is beautifully designed! It gives the feel of a home while offering all the perks of a hotel - hotel dining is out of this world, the staff is brilliant and extremely caring!

Hotel offers in house kayaking, tennis, mini golf and various facilities but can arrange tours / wine tastings If needed. It is a bit farther off from the hustle & bustle of the city but all in all, if in the Hermanus area this would be the top choice!

Outstanding experience!!,"This was an experience we will forever hold special! The property is beautifully built with so much attention to detail. A ‘luxury treehouse’ was unimaginable until we visited Tsala. The teams are absolutely wonderful - I had just left one comment about a special occasion while booking and EVERY SINGLE TEAM MEMBER including at their restaurants that we interacted with knew about it and went the extra mile to make it special for us! I can’t thank the teams enough!

The rooms were amazing, comfortable and clean! Food was divine and the overall experience was something completely out of the ordinary. A bit of wildlife with the baboons on the roof made the experience even more real.

Went for dinners at the hunters lodge as well as Zinzi! Like everything else, Food and service was amazing and worth adding to the experience!

Although the pools aren’t heated, it was clean nonetheless! Mini bar including the alcohol is inclusive!

Thank you to the teams at Tsala for making this so special for us!",March 2020,Tsala Treetop Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1057075-d482504-Reviews-Tsala_Treetop_Lodge-Harkerville_Plettenberg_Bay_Western_Cape.html,"Harkerville, South Africa",hotels,5.0,5.0
Under renovation always,"Just because you are in Athens .. it’s probably worth going to the acropolis to tick the box. If you are interested in architecture or building, read up on a bit of history before you go as it really makes the steep walk worthwhile!",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Comfortable Central apartment - Brilliant team,"Stayed for a week during Nov/Dec. Before the hotel, worth mentioning that the small team at Andromeda really makes you feel at home! Always smiling and ready to help! The location is ideal and we barely needed to take any public transport to explore the sights and dining in Athens (bus and taxi stops just in front of the hotel and train stop a few mins walk away if needed). Syntagma Square, Monestaraki with all the shopping, dining and little bars scattered around are a few mins walk which makes it a wonderful central location.

Parking is a challenge nearby (€ 12 overnight parking is a 3 min walk). Driving to and fro from the hotel is extremely straining; Roads are always packed, under construction or closed due to protests so keep this in mind while staying anywhere in central Athens (however, being stuck in this area isn’t necessarily a bad thing).

However, recommended for Athens first timers / on-foot explorers. Maybe worth looking at outside areas for repeat visitors or those looking to rent a car and drive outside of Athens !!",November 2019,Andromeda Downtown Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d12840137-Reviews-Andromeda_Downtown_Suites-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5

Central hotel; great connectivity but trains are loud,"Everything that you would expect from a Basic hotel. Would definitely not rate it 4* by any means. I requested an iron and ironing board - was asked to come down to take it (which was a bit of a surprise) - but atleast I got the iron which I guess is a plus! The location is good being right next to the central station, bus service directly to Frankfurt airport also helps but access to city center isn’t ideal and is a bit of a walk. The hotel gives free travel cards so that’s a plus point when it comes down to getting into main city center! If you pick a room at the back of the hotel, the train sounds are loud and almost impossible to sleep until late at night!

Having said that, I’ve been staying at another hotel next to Darmstadium for the last 7 years and while the rooms are better and more spacious at intercity, I think my usual hotel would remain my first choice.",November 2018,IntercityHotel Darmstadt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187336-d2643398-Reviews-IntercityHotel_Darmstadt-Darmstadt_Hesse.html,"Darmstadt, Germany",hotels,3.0,3.5
"Beautiful apartments at an excellent location, great access, friendly staff!","The apartments are very new (less than a year old), modern, extremely well maintained, stones throw away form Nordbahnhof S-Bahn station as well as a tram stop literally at the door. Taxi stand is about 200 meters away Incase that’s your preferred mode of transport! Since there is no one at the reception after 4pm, it would be self check In if you arrive after (process is fairly simple). Supermarket is about a 10 min walk away but basic stuff like dishwashing tablets, liquid, sugar, salt/pepper, shower gel are available! Washers / dryers in the basement (you’ll need to get your own washing liquids). Apartment has heated floors for the cooler months! It really does feel like home once you have bought basic things and not having anyone at the lobby adds to this homely feeling! The staff is AMAZING! Friendly, helpful and genuinely caring! Thank you!!

Downsides: No air conditioning so had to keep the windows open but bar downstairs is sometimes quite loud until 2am - the regularly passing tram also doesn’t make it easier to sleep!

Complete surprise as you walk down the stairs and you don’t expect what you see.. beautiful ambiance, extraordinary service and food to die for.. I came here three days In a row and tried almost everything on the menu.. for starters the raw jewel of the day (chefs sashimi selection), Organic beef tetaki, shrimp tempura and Oyster tempura were my favorites! For the mains, miso black cod is a must try! Rock salt jadori chicken, veil entrecôte, tsukimi udon and the grilled sea bass were amazing! Finally for a sweet ending, while the black sesame mousse confuses the tastebuds, it is highly recommended! I went for the saki tasting as well as the sparkling saki !

Central location; comfortable rooms!,"This is my 6th stay at a NH hotel! This particular Hotel is a stone’s throw away from the Friedrichstrasse station which is well connected towards all directions, the s bahn as well as the u bahn so if the train is your planned mode of transport, this is an ideal location! The staff is excellent, always willing to help with a smile and offer advise! I booked the balcony room assuming it would be bigger but unfortunately was quite cramped due to the design (thin alley with a table and wall in the middle just gave it a small feel)! Great restaurants, bars and shopping just around the corner! Although the train and street noice is quite loud outside, the windows are well sound proofed! Overall, my stay was pleasant, comfortable and well worth the money!

Only downside was the interaction with the NH Rewards team. I had asked about why I didn’t get any points for the stay (booked through the NH website), I was told very confidently that since it’s my first stay I won’t get any points; I wrote back correcting then and sending them details of all my previous stays (including those booked through the NH website), they completely disappeared on me with no response! Being a frequent traveler who spends almost 100/150 nights of the year in hotels and already having stayed over 20 nights at NH, I felt that the NH rewards program was undoubtedly the worst in terms of accumulation, correspondence and loyalty, infact, I’m more likely to remain loyal to NH if they completely eliminate their loyalty program!",March 2018,NH Collection Berlin Mitte Friedrichstrasse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187323-d250461-Reviews-NH_Collection_Berlin_Mitte_Friedrichstrasse-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",hotels,4.0,4.5
Centrally located excellent hotel!,"The hotel is centrally located on Wenceslas square which is easy walking distance from the landmarks as well as shopping! While I would have preferred staying somewhere near old town, centrally located 5* options were limited! The hotel itself is a part of the history of the Czech Republic and was used as a war bunker.. this wonderfully preserved / recreated bunker can be seen on special request for hotel guests (not sure if it open to the public yet).. was definitely interesting to see what lies underneath your hotel! The staff is wonderful, helpful and eager to support where needed! The breakfast was also great! The rooms are outdated but that seemed to be added feel when visiting this beautiful city! Only downside was that due to the central location close to the strip clubs, stepping out at night was a bit scary with lots of “extremely pushy” people approaching, haggling and trying to sell their goods / services!

Definitely NOT recommend for people with mobility issues, with kids or for those wanting to come back after a few drinks!

The location is excellent (just a few mins walk from the tube station), lots of dining and bars options around! will definitely be back!",May 2016,Citadines Holborn-Covent Garden London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d192043-Reviews-Citadines_Holborn_Covent_Garden_London-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
One word.. Amazing,"Excellent location, clean, amazing staff, within walking distance of all attractions. Couldn't have chosen a better location! Gave unbiased Advise or currency exchange, tours to take, taxi services and the tour of their bunker was the highlight of my trip! Como restaurant has great breakfast and dinner.. Room service was also quick!",May 2016,Jalta Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d275250-Reviews-Jalta_Boutique_Hotel-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,5.0,4.5
Poor service and blood stained sheets!,"I stayed at Crowne Plaza Jeddah as a business traveller for one night only (20th / 21st Oct 2014). Although, the check in was hassle free, the check-in staff had to be possibly the worst in i have come across; Rude, sarcastic and discourteous! Initially denied late check-out but given only when I questioned on the late checkout allowance for IHG members (again with some comment and laughter exchanged with his colleague)..

I move up to my room at about 11:30pm, order room service (told 35mins) and walk in for a quick shower... after 45 mins, i call them to check on my food and again i get a response on the lines of: ""it has only been 33 minutes i have the time printed here .. you go and check again what time you ordered"" .. the food arrives in another 10 mins which is absolutely cold, the fries are soggy and my drink is not there.. desperately wanting to sleep for the night, i take a couple of bites and lift the duvet to get into bed with another surprise ... BLOOD STAINS ON THE SHEETS! no one has bothered to change the sheets and basically just ""fixed"" them. I would have assumed that after the whole episode of people contracting various diseases when travelling to Jeddah (post Hajj season), a chain associated with IHG would have atleast been careful about basic hygiene and cleanliness! I request the sheets to be changed, fortunately, the change was quick and apologetic .. While checking out the next day, i mentioned (to the same person who checked me in) that the food was cold and there were blood stains on the sheets and he laughs again and tells his colleague something in again before apologizing to me..

To me it seemed like due to the lack of options in the Area, the hotel has adopted careless nonchalant attitude where there is no respect for guests, no concept of health concerns and zero understanding of customer service! Would definitely recommend looking elsewhere incase anyone plans to travel to Jeddah!

Oh, and IHG rejected my post because apparently the blood stain pics are not much of a concern for them!",October 2014,Crowne Plaza Jeddah,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295419-d299181-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_Jeddah-Jeddah_Makkah_Province.html,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",hotels,1.0,4.5
Park plaza. Great location and service with a smile overshadows the small sized yet clean rooms,"The hotel is very centrally located (just about 200 ft from the BTS Asoka station). Although the rooms are small, however the positive attitude of the staff, the helpfulness and not accepting satisfactory as their standard brings out the true definition of the Asian hospitality that we hear of! (in particular mr Ko at the front desk). Close to nana square, soi cowboy as well as some of the more premium clubs such as bed supper club, the state tower, etc! Breakfast was awful but who cares when you have soo many great places around the area!",October 2012,Park Plaza Sukhumvit Bangkok,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293916-d939455-Reviews-Park_Plaza_Sukhumvit_Bangkok-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",hotels,4.0,4.5
One word! Fabulous.,"Beautiful hotel with the most accommodating staff I have ever come across! 'no' is just not in their dictionary! Truly speaks of the amazing Asian hospitality that we hear so much about! The rooms were beautiful, the bed was very comfortable and had a bathroom to die for! the breakfast is not to be missed as it is truly extravagant! The pool is small however the private beach is just a few steps away (have to be there at sunset time)! The Thai restaurant has some seriously great food too! On the downside, cabs to and from the hotel are a problem (usually 800 - 900) baht just one way to patong beach / bangla street! Best option is to book the cabbie for a return trip with a 4 hr wait! They usually agree for 1600 baht and guarantee your return to the hotel! (yes, cabbies from town usually refuse a one way trip to this side of town at night)!",October 2012,Renaissance Phuket Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1223683-d1634352-Reviews-Renaissance_Phuket_Resort_Spa-Mai_Khao_Thalang_District_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",hotels,5.0,4.5
