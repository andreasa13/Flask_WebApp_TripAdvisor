Excellent low cost accomodations near Mt. Snow,"The property is a great option for a ski trip to Mt. Snow. Helpful and present owner/operator. Big property with great common spaces. Huge hot tub. Game room with a pool table, fusball, air hockey, and pinball machines. Nice big fireplace with couches to lounge on. Huge dining room in which to enjoy the included breakfast, which was excellent (eggs, potatoes, pancakes, coffee, tea, etc.). The room was very basic and very small, but the beds were comfortable enough. Bathroom was worn and tiny, but passable. The floors and walls are thin so it can be a little loud. It's also right on a busy road so road noise can be very noticeable.

Convenient and passable restaurant,"The restaurant on site was passable but I wouldn't call it good. The french onion soup was pretty good. The duck dish was advertised as ""Roast"" but was actually deep fried and had no discernible flavor other than that of the frier oil.

Conveniently located motel stay of marginal quality,"We've stayed at the Hungry Trout a coupe of time during trips up to Whiteface. The location can't be beat. The facility itself is very hit an miss. Some rooms are somewhat renovated and offer marginally reasonable accommodation for the price and considering the scarcity of other options. The non-renovated rooms are really just unacceptable and I would not stay there again unless assured I would not be in one. The non-renovated rooms have horrible mattresses. Completely unfit to offer to a guest. The renovated rooms have newer and much more comfortable mattresses. Both renovated and non-renovated feel dingy and not very clean. We found hairs on our bed linens on one occasion. The two chairs that were in our renovated room were stained in one case and covered with old gum in the other case. I had to place a spare blanket on the better of the two in order to feel comfortable sitting on it. The internet service was completely non-functional due to poor signal in our room and shouldn't be advertised as available. The bathroom in the non-renovated room was pretty gross, the renovated a bit better. Both had black mold forming in the bathtub areas. The restaurant on site was passable but I wouldn't call it good.

Highlight of the Milos Visit,"This spot is really amazing. Fantastic waters, beautiful caves, amazing rock formations, and lots of other tourists enjoying the scene. We were there at the end of September and I can't imagine how crowded it must be in July/August. Great cliff jumping too from 8, 17, or about 25 feet.

Beautiful Spot,Lovely spot. We accessed on a boat tour but there were folks there who had taken an ATV and hiked in which seemed like a good option. Coral was all dead so nothing to really snorkel or scuba there. Lovely caves and rock formations abound.,September 2019,Kleftiko Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g494953-d1572068-Reviews-Kleftiko_Beach-Milos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Milos, Greece",attractions,4.0,5.0
It's all about expectations,"The good:
- Comfortable boat. Seat backs to lean against and plenty of space to lounge
- Reasonably friendly captain (contrary to other reviews) and crew.
- Good destinations and we had plenty of time to swim. If it was hotter out, we might have wanted to spend more time in the water but in the very end of Sept, the water was a bit cool and the wind was quite chilly.
- Very friendly dog
- Shorter cruise than the others. I didn't want 10-12 hours on a boat. This was more like 6 hours.

The Bad:
- This was not a party boat at all. No fun vibe. No explanations of anything. No real tour guide vibe. no music. Just a boat and a route.
- Food was ""included"" but really pretty minimal. For breakfast, they served bad store bought croissant and pound cake. For lunch, they served some tomato salad, some sliced bread, hunks of cheese, and some cold cuts. There was water available and there was some boxed white whine (barely drinkable). They served some watermelon at the end of the tour.

Bottom line, it's not a luxury cruise and you won't be pampered. No one is going to get people smiling and make it feel fun. You will get to see some beautiful stuff that can only be accessed by boat. The tour is cheaper than others and shorter than others. You get what you pay for. Walk in with clear expectations and you won't be disappointed.",September 2019,Andromeda Yachting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g494953-d10398749-Reviews-Andromeda_Yachting-Milos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Milos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Beautiful hotel and fantastic service,"Things to know about Tholos:
- Like many hotels in Imerovigli, you must walk alot of stairs to get down to your room. This is not a hotel for the infermed. I'd estimate 50-75 steps down from street level to our room. They are happy to help you with your bags if you call reception, but no one is carrying you down, you'll have to walk it yourself.
- Service was great. Our hostess, Margarita was wonderful.
- We averaged about 18K steps a day while staying here. This is a very active trip location due to the steps and walkable location (about 25 minutes to Fira)
- Many great restaurants local in Imerovigli.
- Why go to Fira...really at all. It's so full of tourists and tourist shops it's kind of pointless. Better to look at Fira from afar while enjoying your peaceful stay in Imerovigli.
- The pool is not heated but is beautiful and has a bar adjacent with friendly service (thanks Georges)
- Our honeymoon suite was great. The hot tub on the patio was nice and warm but not scalding hot. The room felt reasonably private (tough in Imerovigli because the hotels and rooms are stacked on top of one another).
- The king bed was reasonably comfortable but not the best we had in our three hotel tour of Greece.
- The safe was broken in our room and was also too small to put a laptop in. This is something the hotel should really resolve. Not expensive to have a laptop sized safe in room.
- Breakfast was excellent and made to order.

Overall and excellent stay in a lovely hotel.",October 2019,Tholos Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d626102-Reviews-Tholos_Resort-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Beautiful Monastery and not very crowded,"We were there in October so that may have contributed to the lack of crowd. It was a beautiful drive to get there and an interesting visit. Lovely architecture with fantastic mosaic and painted ceilings in the church and crypt. Creepy and miraculously preserved body of saint Lukas from about 1000AD is on display in the church.

Must see historical site,"We rented a car for the day to drive from Athens ($40 for the rental + $25 in gas + $15 in tolls). The drive was about 2.5 hours and not stressful. Thankfully, we were there in early October and the heat was manageable (still very hot). Get there early (leave Athens 8am). I can't imagine being there in July or August. The museum has some great artifacts and is a fairly quick walk through. The site itself is very beautiful and well worth the drive. I'd highly recommend taking some time during the drive to listed to some historical blogs as well as to download a walking audio tour for while you are there. It really added a lot to have the background before arriving. Stop off in nearby Arachova for lunch or coffee on your way out.

Fantastic stay in a perfect location,"The building is beautifully renovated and impeccably clean. Mariana was a fantastic host and went out of her way to take care of us and offer 5 star service. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Acropolis view suite, which was a lovely two room setup with a beautiful and huge outdoor balcony overlooking the Acropolis. The rooms and common areas were tastefully decorated and the bedding was very comfortable. My only points of constructive feedback are: 1) the breakfast is boxed and was just ok, and 2) the bed pillows were not great. I prefer down pillows and these were a bit over bulky and all synthetic.

Best meal(s) I've had in years...so good I went twice,"Wow.

This place deserves the 5 stars that it has. I'm pretty critical as you'll see if you look at my other reviews. I love good food. i look for it wherever I go. If reviews tell me to expect great food, I walk in with high expectations.

I walked in with high expectations both times I went (2 of three nights in Athens) and was blown away.

The service is fantastic. The sommelier Amanda gets a special call out for both her glowing friendly personality and her great knowledge of the wines. She introduced us to some great Greek wines at each of our meals, which we probably wouldn't have ordered without her expert help. They apparently have between 150 and 300 wines in the restaurant on any given night and very few on the menu so ask for help pairing. Very reasonably priced wine list.

The food was fantastic. The dishes were creative in their composition, beautifully plated, and really delicious. To begin, they presented us with a very tasty amuse bouches to begin on both evenings. The bread is worth it. Wow is the bread worth it. Their french brioche rolls are the best bread I've had in recent memory. The mix of the salty, crunchy crust with the olive oil was amazing. The raisin filled sweet bread was also amazing (no olive oil on this one though). I could personally pass on the Greek style rolls (and did the second night). The appetizers were great both nights. I'll cover both nights in the one review:
- Tuna and avocado in a nori wrap (crunchy seaweed) was excellent. Nothing super unique (typical sesame/rice vinegar flavours), but very well executed. (ordered this both nights...it was that tasty)
- Potato w/ soft egg and duck confit was very tasty. Not the best of what we ordered, but delicious none the less.
- Wood fired squid and eggplant was the highlight of the apps. It was really sublime. I like but don't love squid. I'd never had squid in a dish like this.

Entrees were excellent:
- The agnolotti with rabbit stuffing was delicious. It was just slightly too al dente for my taste (maybe needed another 30 seconds) but delicious none the less.
- The Fresh cod with chowder from shells and potato gnocchi was fantastic. We ordered this both nights.
- The Lamb Tenderloin, white onion puree, baby potatoes, black trompettes sauce was out of this world as well.

Deserts were out of this world.
- the Lemon tarte, meringue and praline ice cream, was simply the best desert I've ever had in my entire life. It really isn't a tarte because there is no pastry shell. It's more like a creative lemon mousse w/ passion fruit accents and crunchy wafers. Between our first and second visit, we had a lengthy conversation about what to call it and settled on ""lemon heaven"". Ordered this both nights.
- The almond cake w/ sour cherry ice cream was delicious and unique. Also not a cake. Really more of a mousse. The flavors were so interesting in contrast.
- Lastly also had a chocolate lava cake. This wasn't unique, but was very well executed and super tasty.

They offered us some lovely aperitifs paired to the deserts ordered.

In summary: perfect service, creative menu, fantastic food. I wish I could bring this restaurant home with me.",October 2019,Scala Vinoteca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2454645-Reviews-Scala_Vinoteca-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
The nice view can't make up for the terrible service and reheated food,"What a let down...

The food was somewhere between mediocre and terrible.
The service was the worst I've experienced in years.
The owner was argumentative and unprofessional.
The only thing they had going for them was a fantastic view of the acropolis...which you had to enjoy in a cloud of cigarette smoke because I had smokers on three sides of my table.

To begin our experience, we were seated at a lovely table (lovely until everyone around us lit up their cigarettes). The waiter was arrogant and unhelpful. When I asked for assistance selecting wine to pair with our meal, he told us that they didn't have a solamier because the ""wine list is not so expensive"" but that he could help us. He then went on to tell us that since we wanted white wine, it really doesn't matter. He actually told us ""White wine is not like red wine...it doesn't have all of those descriptions...medium body, dry, fruit forward, etc. Just order this one and I'm sure you'll like it"". Not off to a good start. After offering no help and a fair portion of arrogance...he took our order and then literally did not come back to the table through the entire meal.

The food came too quickly. Should have been the second clue. My wife's lamb wrapped in grape leaves was TERRIBLE. For the $30 the entree cost, I'd say inedible. Our agreed upon description was dog food. The lamb had clearly been cooked earlier in the day and reheated. It was extremely overcooked to the point of being a uniform grey color and completely dried out. She took one bite, I took one bite, and she put her silverware on the plate indicating she was done with the expectation that the waiter would return and check on us. He never did.

I ate my very mediocre sea bass entree because we were starving. It was also overcooked and had no discernible flavor. This may also have been pre-cooked. The only passable food of the evening was the zucchini balls, which were edible but not great.

I finished my entree and we waited another 15 minutes while the waiter walked back and forth past our table several times without checking on us and with my wife's plate untouched. Finally we stood up and left the table to go speak with the owner and pay for the dishes we'd eaten.

The owner was argumentative, refused our opinions on the food, and had a loud argument with his waiter in front of us. We paid for the one entree, the bottle of wine, and the zucchini balls and left. My wife never had dinner.

I'm baffled by all of the good reviews of this restaurant. I can only think it's an echo chamber of people who haven't actually eaten there but are pursuing ""local guide"" points. If you read ""local guide"" on the reviewer, chances are they haven't actually eaten there.

You couldn't pay me to spend a precious evening of a future vacation eating at this restaurant again.",October 2019,Strofi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1045580-Reviews-Strofi-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5

"Excellent meal, low key restaurant","My wife and I arrived for our reservation and were promptly seated. The service was attentive and friendly.

Very Overrated on Trip Advisor,"My wife and I arrived for dinner at just before 9pm without a reservation and were offered either to place our name on a list and come back in an hour or to sit and wait in line (a long bench had been setup). Based on how crowded and busy it was, I was optimistic it would be good. We were seated about 40 minutes later. The staff was very friendly but extremely rushed and not very attentive. We started with the mushrooms in garlic butter, which was the only excellent part of the meal. The ""homemade bread"" was stale. My wife ordered the orzo with seafood and I ordered the chicken souvlaki. The souvlaki was very mediocre. I think you could do as well at a decent Souvlaki stand. The orzo was not good. This is an example of a mediocre restaurant overhyped on TripAdvisor by excited tourists on vacation.

Lovely meal in a beautiful spot,"My wife and I stopped into Enalion for a 9pm'ish dinner without reservations (end of season). They couldn't seat us immediately but had a lovely table open up at about 9:20 giving us a little time to stroll around. Unfortunately when we returned, before we could be seated, there was a small accident involving a glass of white wine being accidentally spilled on my wife's dress by the waitress. She was very apologetic and after we'd gone back to our room to change seated us right away at a fantastic table in a corner directly in the beach front. The food ranged from good to great. The somalier helped us choose a very nice (and reasonable) Greek white wine to pair with our order. The bread and olive oil were very nice, not run of the mill bread, really tasty. We started with the chickpea salad which is a must order dish and absolutely delicious. We also shared tomato fritters which were very good and has a tangy dipping yogurt sauce. Next the lamb, which was simply prepared but excellent. Lastly we had a common sea bream fish (catch of the day). This was the most expensive thing ordered (35 euro piece of fish) and was just good, not great. I like the type of fish and it was cooked well, but not inspiring prep. Just grilled with some lemon and oil, served with bold potatoes and grain(a quinoa or bulgar?). Compared to the 13 euro lamb dish, it was a let down. Considering that the catch of the day is pricey and really nothing special, I can't give five stars, but it was an excellent meal overall. Topping was that they brought us a complimentary orange cake in apology for the wine accident, which was appropriate and very nice of them. The cake was really delicious. Very good restaurant but I'd stick to the menu of main dishes and skip the catch of the day to keep the meal reasonable. Very nice meal in a beautiful place with good service.",September 2019,Enalion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1105860-d1830322-Reviews-Enalion-Pollonia_Milos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Milos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Wonderful garden dining,"My wife and I spotted this place on our way into Pollonia and returned for brunch the next day due to the nice garden dining. The restaurant has a small indoor shop with a great spread of fresh baked goods, yogurt, and honeys. We had an omelet (served with salad) and a yogurt/honey/fruit bowl. Both were delicious and sizeable portions. They brought a half loaf of bread to the table as well. Tea was Lipton... Which is a little disappointing for a tea drinker. The garden is absolutely lovely place for a meal. It's well shaded and tables are nicely spaced. Great meal. Better quality tea would have made it 5 stars.",September 2019,Kivotos ton Gefseon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1105860-d3326985-Reviews-Kivotos_ton_Gefseon-Pollonia_Milos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Milos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,5.0
"Quaint, friendly, boutique hotel","My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary on a brief trip to Quebec City. The location is perfect. It's walkable to everything yet not in the middle of the tourist chaos. It's located across the street from a park and the city walls. A short walk to the upper and lower parts of the old city as well as outside the walls to the newer parts of the city. Our room had a lovely view of green and of parliament. The room was on the small side but comfortable. The only complaint was that the bed was very squeeky (Room 231). They offered us each a glass of wine or beer on our arrival (house wine was very decent). The breakfast service was tasty with options for crepe, croissant and fruit, or quiche (really an egg flan or casserole because it had no pastry). They had off street parking (paid) and also stored our bikes in the garage for us. The highlight of the stay was the service. Everyone we spoke to was incredibly helpful and went out of their way to make our stay wonderful. Compliments to management for keeping folks like Nancy, Gabrielle, and Anthony on staff.

Creative and delicious,"Wow. What a great meal.

I could end the review there but it wouldn't do full justice. The restaurant feels fun and energetic. It was a bit loud, being a relatively small room with many tables crammed in. That said, it had character and pinache. They were spinning Otis Redding on the vintage record player driven sound system (younger folks might ask... what is that?). The bar mixed a great Moscow mule and upon request, a pretty darn good jalapeño margarita. The tools were very fresh and came with a delicious truffle butter. We started with the ceviche and the beet salad. Both were spectacular. Delicate, creative mixes of flavors and textures. For entrees we had the salmon and the steak. I can't properly describe the salmon but to say again, creative and delicious. Crisp and perfectly cooked, with a yummy puree of something, shoestring sweet potatoes fried crisp and other tasty stuff. We also had the steak entrée, which had the most amazing peppercorn cream sauce with lobster and other amazing flavors in there. The sides were great too, a crisped potato, akin to a great hash brown, beet turnip and carrots. I couldn't leave a bite in the plate, though I was completely stuffed. I wish I'd had room to try the dessert but I was really full.

Great service. Nice portions. Amazing food.

We ate at the Continental last night. That was a really good meal but didn't even compare and cost 50% more,without the creativity.

Wow. What a meal. Highly recommended.

BTW - I really appreciate the copper straws rather than plastic and cloth towels to dry hands.

"Excellent meal, almost 5 stars","We stopped in for a late evening anniversary dinner. The host seated is at a lovely table by a window. The restaurant is fairly large, which could feel impersonal, but was nicely laid out with small dividers to separate the space and create some sense on intimacy. The servers were friendly but not overly so. The wine list was substantial with many reasonably priced options (and some nutty expensive ones too). Huge menu to choose from. We had the seared foie gras and lobster bisque for starters. Both were quite excellent and recommended. We had the flambe filet mignon and fish if the day (a halibut dish) for entrees. The filet was cooked perfectly and magnificent. One of the best I've had in years. The halibut was a bit dry and not a repeat order. I'm sure they would have rectified it if I'd asked but it was so late I chose not to ask. For dessert we had the St. Honore cake for dessert which was just OK. Should have gotten the creme brulee. Overall an excellent meal, but not quite 5 stars.",September 2018,Le Continental,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155033-d706085-Reviews-Le_Continental-Quebec_City_Quebec.html,"Quebec City, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Disappointing fly by,"We made reservations for our anniversary. I specifically noted the event and requested a quiet and romantic table. When we arrived, the waitress first attempted to seat us at a table in the middle of the restaurant right next to the fireplace and in the highest traffic spot in the floor. We requested to move upstairs but were told no. The second table we were sat at had a 100w halogen lamp dangling over it that would have required sunscreen. The table next to us had folks in bright golf shirts and shorts seated. The restaurant was a balmy 76 or 78 degrees and I found it very uncomfortable, sweating before I even had water served to the table. Though the menu looked interesting, for $54 entrees, we decided to cut and run. Not the restaurant experience I was looking for. They then suggested that perhaps we'd like a table upstairs,but that it was likely even warmer. We passed. I can't comment on the food but was very disappointed with the experience. I'm sure the food would have been lovely but ignoring the reservation seating request, keeping the restaurant at an uncomfortably high temperature, and allowing shorts and sneaker patrons at 8pm for dinner service in what is billed as one of the ""fancier"" restaurants in Quebec was in combination too much of a turn off to ignore.

Decent meal in a land of mediocrity,"My wife and I stopped in for dinner this evening with our kids. We ate outside on the covered patio which was nice. The service was friendly and reasonably attentive. We started with soups. I had the French onion soup, which was really quite good (and I'm a harsh judge), though it could have been broiled a bit longer to brown the cheese. My wife had the Lobster bisque, which was just ok, not a repeat order, but edible. My kids had bacon cheeseburger and chicken fingers respectively (both good, excellent fries). I had the Alaskan salmon with miso glaze, which was very tasty and well cooked. The vegetables were also good but the rice was overcooked and bland. My wife had the Sis's special fish, which was very good. The flourless chocolate cake wasn't good and not worth the order. All in all a good meal in an area full of mediocrity.

Clean and efficient condo hotel,"My family and I stayed at Surf Beach this year for our annual stay to visit grandma. We've been coming to the area for about 10 years but have typically rented a condo in Madeira Beach, just north of here. Our past stays have been at a variety of listings but over the last 5 years we narrowed it down to the Sea Breeze and Sea View buildings, because we found the pools nice, they have hot tubs, and the beach is nice. This year, we had a shorter stay and needed more if a hotel style accommodation, but still wanted 2br condo accommodations.

Surf Beach is run more like a hotel, there is a staffed front desk, towels are provided, rooms set to be consistently furnished. The front desk staff (Adam) is super friendly and helpful. The building seems well maintained and clean. As compared to the condo building we prefer in Madeira, it's a bit cramped. The condo is about 600sf and 2br/2ba so quite compact. That said, it gets the job done. The beds were comfortable and the pullout in the small living room had a comfortable hybrid innerspring /air mattress. All units face the beach.

The parking is extremely cramped and difficult to navigate, but works. The pool is a bit small and is right next to the building and parking, giving it a less than optimal feeling (not very resort like). The hot tub was kept nice and hot. The beach is right in front of the building but the shore itself is quite far (maybe 400 feet walk) due to the width of the beach. There is a beach walkway in front of the pool that further takes away from the resort feel.

All in all, clean and efficient, nice staff. Kitchen is workable but not hospitable (e.g. No salt and pepper, no oil, etc such as we'd typically find in a rental condo). It worked for this trip but I'd go back to Madeira if coming back for a full week.",May 2018,Surf Beach Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34693-d589286-Reviews-Surf_Beach_Resort-Treasure_Island_Florida.html,"Treasure Island, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.5

Good food for great food prices,"I had the occasion to visit the Redstone American Grill recently in a business trip. Along the way I had met some folks and set decided to grab dinner together. This was the convenient and appealing option.

The restaurant is nicely designed. The decor and coffee are really nice. There's an open kitchen and large dining room but at chose to eat outside in their patio area. It was a very nice environment. Not overly intimate, but not impersonal either.The service was attentive but not overly so.

The food came out very quickly. I ordered a house salad and the sea bass. The salad was fine but overly dressed. It was huge. The sea bass was a nice piece of fish and perfectly cooked... but it too was over marinated. The rice was ok but nothing special and the vegetables were also over sauced. All of the food tasted good and was cooked well, but for the prices being charged, it lacked even a little bit of grace or artistry.

If the 5oz. piece of sea bass (served with plain rice and some routine garden veggies) hadn't been around $40, I probably would have given it a 4. At that price I expect a chef, not a good cook.",October 2017,Redstone American Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g36468-d621624-Reviews-Redstone_American_Grill-Oak_Brook_DuPage_County_Illinois.html,"Oak Brook, Illinois",restaurants,3.0,4.0
The best bet in the neighborhood,"This is a great neighborhood bar. I've been here on many occasions over the years and was back in recently for a late bite and some drinks.

I love the decor in this bar. They did a great renovation a few years back that I really like, created some patio seating, and usually have great music playing. I love that they keep the kitchen open late and they've been my savior on many nights.

They have a lot of beers on tap and I've never pulled a skunked point from them. I don't like the down east cider they keep on tap. I wish they'd change that out for gumption or woodchuck.

The food is always OK and sometimes good. I've been eating their brunswick salad for near 15 years. The burgers and fries are generally good but they're ability to cook to the requested temperature is hit and miss. I don't particularly like their steak sandwich, I find it bland. I'd really only give the food 3 stars.

Wonderful new addition,"My wife and I stopped by on a quiet Sunday evening for dinner at the bar. The bartenders were very chipper and attentive. Nice drink and wine by the glass menu. My wife tried The Dutchess drink, which she thought to be just ok but I thought tasty.

We shared the duck confit with corn gnocchi. It was really excellent! Not just pretty good. Really good. I couldn't help ordering some fries (person next over was munching and they looked good). Excellent fries. Dessert was a really spectacular bread pudding with a caramel ice cream. Terribly decadent, deliciously satisfying.

Beautiful and airy space with not over the top decor. Outdoor dining area, fire pit, bocci court... I'll definitely be back.

"Big portions, big restaurant, huge wait","Go for lunch or don't bother. The food is good, the deck and view beautiful, the portions huge, the menu enticing. All that said, they don't take reservations and regularly have a 30+ minute wait for a table if you show up after 6pm. I personally just won't eat out at a place I have to wait 30+ minutes at the crowded bar.

The tacos are amazing (especially the pulled pork). I found the briscut to be dry and lacking flavor. Santa Fe salad delicious but drowned in some creamy dressing that sort of defeated the purpose of the salad. My wife's signature smoke signals margarita was not good at all and she sent it back.

This place is actually good and we've come back each of the last 5 years we've been here since trying it.

Meatball app is great. The pork osso bucco is spectacular. The chicken parm is yummy. I had the chicken Marsala last time and that is super tasty too. I don't love their pizza, but given where you are, it's not bad, just not great.

Tiramisu gets good reviews from my wife (I don't like Tiramisu). The canolis are soggy. I wouldn't recommend them. I suspect they prefill them rather than filling when ordered.

This place is very decent. Nothing special to the decor. Service is friendly and good. I haven't tried the Thai food there but have had sushi a coupes times and it's been pretty consistent.

In my last visit, the King crab and yellow trail sushi were both delicious. I don't love the spicy tunes rolls. They seem to use a dry spice mixed into the tuna rather than a spicy mayo and I just don't prefer it. The duck salad was very tasty. Liquor and drink menu was very reasonable.

"Lovely restaurant, ok food","The decor is very nice but feels almost out of place. It feels very Hamptons to me. That said, I like it.

It was a busy night and there was a bit if a din, but we could hear each other well enough. Service was professional but not friendly and welcoming.

We began with the white bean and shrimp app. It was very flavorful but terribly over salted. For entrees, my wife had the seafood risotto, which was tasty but unexceptional. Very good texture but overcooked shrimp. I had the pasta bolonese, which was mediocre. The flavor was good but it was dry, with barely enough bolonese to coat the pasta and none left for bread).

The cheesecake dessert was exceptionally good.

The wine menu was very pricey. I don't mean great bottles of wine, I mean 400% mark up vs what the same bottle goes for in a store. Also, don't serve my overpriced wine in a tumbler glass.

The only issue I had was that they used a very bready pita and I prefer not to fill my belly with bread (rather with falafel). My realy issue is that a falafel where I come from is still to this day $3.50, including the same 4 falafel balls. I'd typically buy 2 for lunch. At $8 or $9 for the sandwich at Aba's, I can't afford to buy 2. The pita is more bready so it's a little more filling but also not what I want to be filled with.

Excellent Pizza!,"I grew up in Manhattan with all the greats as my go to's: Ben's, John's, Lombardi's, Ray's, the other Ray's, and the other... I feel like part of my formal education was in pizza.

Village pizza is pretty darn good. Thin crust, crisped enough, but not crispy, usually enough sauce (though I have had dry pies there). I'd like them to do fresh mushroom on pies which they don't seem to do. Otherwise, I'm very happy with them as a go to pizza spot. Great specials make this an easy family order.

My experience with sandwiches there is less amazing. I've tried the philly cheese steak, which was OK but not a repeat order. A bit different, tasted like there was some tomato in the mix somewhere. Too little steak and cheese for the bread and a bit dry. I had a similar experience with the meatball parm.
