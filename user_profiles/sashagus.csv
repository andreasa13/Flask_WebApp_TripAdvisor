Very interesting,"This museum is very modern and well organized.
A lot of interesting historical pieces from ancient Greece and everything is well explained, in English, in informative posters.
Students from European Union have free entrance tickets.",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best sandwich of my life,"Great sandwich shop. It's small and genuinely charming, in its own way and without trying.
It was rcommended by a local and totally worth it. Everything is prepared on the spot with a lot of ingredients, everything being full of flavour, including the different types of fluffy bread.
I strongly recommend the sandwich number 27 as well as the green spicy juice.
Great price for the amazing quality and flavour involved.",October 2019,Guarantee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7988552-Reviews-Guarantee-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Normal food,"It's a restaurant with typical greek food but not abundant in flavour.
Regarding the price, it's not expensive but not cheap for the quality of the food that is served but the portions are big.
At night, the decoration looks interestingly nice.",October 2019,Opos palia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4195130-Reviews-Opos_palia-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Lots of history; perfect view,"A place with a lot of history and a great panoramic view of Athens. Really nice at the end of the afternoon.
However, you need a bit of imagination to really understand how things were in ancient Greece, but it's still worth it.
Also, students from the European Union have entrance tickets for free.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Burgers honour the name of the restaurant,"Very tasty and juicy burgers. Great value for money. If you are looking for a different meal in Santorini, this is definitely the place. It also offers some traditional Greek options and a mix of Greek ingredients in international dishes.
Strongly recommend within the hamburger space.",October 2019,Juicy Burger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g658914-d8764004-Reviews-Juicy_Burger-Kamari_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
