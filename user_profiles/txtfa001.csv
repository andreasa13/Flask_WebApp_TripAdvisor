Excellent,"We went for lunch because we were in the area and it was very good. We had two of the lunch specials and they were a very nice size. I had jambalaya and my husband had catfish and shrimp. We would definitely go back again if in the area. They also have paintings on the wall by local artists that are for sale. Be sure to notice the Blue Dog painting (not for sale, and it is a print, but a good one) by Rodrigue. We also had a great waiter.",February 2020,Cypress Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g30196-d437932-Reviews-Cypress_Grill-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice For a Quick Lunch,"I eat a friend for lunch and it was very nice. The staff was helpful and I thought the food was good and reasonably priced. I had the medium sized poke bowl and it was plenty. My friend had bibembop (spelling?) and really liked it. She had so much she had to take some home. Hers looked so good I plan to back and order it.

Excellent Lunch,"We were in Brownsville today and stopped here for a late lunch and it was excellent. My husband had a whole grilled fish and I had the special of the day. Mine was blackened white fish wit crawfish etouffee. It was really a special, because it was half price. Both were well cooked and our waitress was great too.

"Small, but Excellent Exhibit","We went by to see the exhibit which we had heard about. It was very nice. It shows the costumes of various Latin American countries, and one Native American costume with explanations. It is in the same building as the Children’s Museum and just across the Street from the zoo. Having visited several of the countries whose costumes were on display I can say they are authentic. There is also an explanation of how the exhibit came into being.

I Have Never Given. a Rating ThisLow Before,"When one visits a Fine Arts Museum one expects fine art. Well, we went today and what we got was Space-X and a tribute to E. Musk. There were photos and paper models of the spacecraft. If you are into the Space-X thing it would probably be of interest. However, if you live around here and remember when Musk said he located Space-X here because if one of the rockets blew up it was ok, because “no one lives there” you might see things differently.",January 2020,Brownsville Museum of Fine Art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60928-d4871146-Reviews-Brownsville_Museum_of_Fine_Art-Brownsville_Texas.html,"Brownsville, Texas",attractions,2.0,3.5
Are We Still in Edinburg,"It’s like you walk through a portal to a parallel universe? I was told the chef came from Las Vegas. We had an absolutely fantastic meal and the atmosphere is wonderful. They also have a jazz musician playing while you eat. The food is out of this world and I say this after eating a lot of meals in North America, South America, Europe and even North Africa. I was almost afraid to order meatloaf in such a fancy place, but it wasn’t like any I had ever had before. The service was perfect!

"No Cart, but Real Dim Sum","Four of us went today. My husband and son-in-law both ordered off the regular menu and my daughter and I had dim sum. Everything was great. I like going for the dim sum when someone else is with me because you can order more things. I especially like their sticky rice in lotus leaf and their pork buns either steamed or baked. That is not to say the other dim sum items are bad, just that the ones I ordered are my favorite. If you have never had them, try the chicken feet. They are a very popular dim sum dish and actually good.

Yummy Shrimp,My husband and I stopped here while out running errands. I had a shrimp dish with spicy sauce and broccoli. It came with a rice quinoa base. I loved it until I got home and saw the sodium level. Not sure why someone would include that high a level of sodium.

Nice Lunch,"We had just finished an appointment nearby and were hungry so we saw this restaurant and went there to eat. It was not very busy at all because it was an off time. The waiter was friendly and we were waited on promptly. We both ordered filets which were cooked to order (my husband is into medium well and I like medium rare).

We Have Been to Several in this Chain,We were visiting a friend in the hospital and went for lunch. It’s quick and predictable. I spend most of my time with the dips and salads but today I also had some very good chicken and gyros meat. I usually ask for the lamb shank which is not out on the buffet and I would recommend it. They have baclava for dessert as well. It was pretty busy when we arrived and we were kind of late so it appears to be popular.,December 2019,Dimassi's Mediterranean Buffet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56538-d2392170-Reviews-Dimassi_s_Mediterranean_Buffet-Richardson_Texas.html,"Richardson, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Had a Great Dinner,"We were up in north Austin because of an early morning Dr. appointment the next day. Our hotel had closed the restaurant because there were so few people in the hotel (the Sunday after Thanksgiving). We decided to go to Paddadeaux and it was a great idea. I had Moroccan salmon which was delicious and my husband had his favorite, fried shrimp. The waiter was friendly and the food arrived quickly.

Nice Hotel,"I have stayed in lots of Marriotts of every type (lifetime member) and this one was just fine and comfortable. We had flown in from Europe and did a lot of laundry since we had to wait overnight for our next flight. The laundry was nice and the machines were easy to use. They have a very nice breakfast as well. I’m really not much on scrambled eggs but they also had some with salsa and cheese which were very good. My only issue (probably doesn’t rise to the level of a formal complaint) was the airport shuttle. When we checked in we told the front desk we needed the shuttle the next day. This morning when I asked about how soon to be downstairs they said we were not on the shuttle list. They fixed it for me, but if I hadn’t asked it might have caused a problem. We went downstairs about 15 minutes early. The van came in and pulled into the parking lot about 10 minutes early. However when it was time to leave it was still sitting there. I went in and asked when it was going to pick us up. The woman at the desk called and said about 5 minutes. I asked why since he had been sitting in the back of the parking lot for 10 minutes. She looked surprised and called him back. Then he drove over. Not sure what that was all about, but everything was fine in the end.",November 2019,Fairfield Inn & Suites Fort Lauderdale Airport & Cruise Port,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34168-d1503560-Reviews-Fairfield_Inn_Suites_Fort_Lauderdale_Airport_Cruise_Port-Dania_Beach_Broward_County_Flo.html,"Dania Beach, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.0
Tired and Hungry After Transatlantic Flight,"We were tired, hungry and wanted to go to sleep. We found this restaurant a short walk from our hotel and loved it. We didn’t have a huge meal but what we had was great. We both had soup; one chicken and one bean and were both happy. We also had plantains and yucca. I had lots of iced tea since it’s hard to find in Europe and I missed it. The waitress was wonderful and very efficient. The hostess came by to check on us too and the manager or owner came by as well. A great place, so great we are probably going for lunch today before flying the rest of the way home today.",November 2019,Padrino's Cuban,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34168-d16693457-Reviews-Padrino_s_Cuban-Dania_Beach_Broward_County_Florida.html,"Dania Beach, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.0
I Loved It,We went to one of the normal changing that occur every hour. It was interesting and the precision was amazing. They stayed in time even when their backs were turned and they couldn’t see each other. The entire ceremony takes a little while. When we got there the two guards that were going to be relieved were moving around. Then their replacements arrived and the exchange took place. It is also interesting to look up the symbolism of the uniforms. These soldiers also raise and lower the flag daily on the top of the Acropolis. There is an interesting story about that too.,November 2019,Changing of the Guard Ceremony,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12064411-Reviews-Changing_of_the_Guard_Ceremony-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Very well done,"The museum as interesting and very well done. We mostly concentrated on the Acropolis materials although most are reproductions because Britainwont give them back. We saw the marbles in London but it would be nice to see them at home again. They have done an outstanding job with what they have. There are video stations that show how items were placed on the Buildings. They also have a very nice restaurant on the second floor where we had a nice lunch.

My Main Reason to go to Athens,"Wonderful experience. We went in the afternoon and the weather was perfect. I had read about it, taught it in Western Civ and was very happy to see it in person. The crowds were small so it was easy to see everything. If I had been able to, i.e. had enough time, I would have gone to the museum first, then gone up and returned to the museum for a second visit.

The waiter said it was for two people and there were four of us. We ordered one anyway and it was plenty. We already knew about the cash v credit card issue from being in Crete. I won’t go into all of it, but they have a very good reason to want cash.

Specialty Shopping,"We have been in several times and everything is high quality. We bought freshly ground coffee , popcorn, tea and chocolates so far. They have these really neat chocolates in the form of acorns, squash and other vegetables. Usually something like this is cheap chocolate, but not these. They were great. They have popcorn that is no salt, 40% of regular salt and full salt. They also have Leukoumi both in boxes and in open containers so you can mix varieties.

EXCELLENT!,"We went today because it was the only restaurant in the area we were in that was not a buffet. It was wonderfully good. Ordering was interesting because the people running it spoke absolutely no English and we spoke no Greek to Chinese. I tried to use Google translate and asked for a Greek translation...no luck. She got her Chinese to English out and we were able to communicate. There is an English menu so you can just point unless you have a specific question like I did. Everything was cooked to order (probably not the duck, but everything else). The presentation was beautiful. We had Beijing Duck, edadami, and steamed dumplings. They brought fresh fruit for dessert. I’m not sure why no one else has reviewed it but we plan to go back again with some friends before we leave. FYI they only have four tables inside and I don’t know if they have seating across the street like some of the others do.

Real Local Food,We were at the museum across the street and went for lunch. It was excellent. We all had a Greek salad and Cretin spaghetti.

Fascinating,Four of us went for the day and had a wonderful time. I know some people aren’t happy with some of the reconstruction but I think it makes it easier for non history visitors to see.

An Important place to Visit,"We went four times to finish it all. I admit that we look at everything and read it all. Well worth the time if you want to see everything. Sometimes after three or four hours I get museum overload and have to have time to process. There is so much in the museum starting with Minoan and going through Greek and Roman history that I would suggest doing it in pieces if you have time. Also, before you go to Knossos, where many of the artifacts were found I really recommend that you look at the frescos on the second floor that came from there. The explanations will help when you visit the site. We looked at them before we went to the site and again when we came back. We spent about 11 hours in the museum, but I do need to admit that I am a retired history professor and our friends are philosophers. We came to Crete in the first place because my husband had been fascinated with Minoan culture since he was an undergraduate.

We followed this with a lentil salad and Quesadillas. they even had Jalapeños. I also had a glass of home made sangria. We finished off with a Greek dessert. They have old maps of Texas on the walls.
