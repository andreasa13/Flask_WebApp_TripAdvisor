Well worth a visit,"Had a lovey stop off here one evening whilst on the Slea Head drive. It was very quiet which made it all more special. It was lovely to walk down the narrow little road to the pier and enjoy the amazing view all around it and have the opportunity to get some photos without feeling the need to move on. It was nice to enjoy and take it all in at our own pace.
Only negative, the walk back up to the car park!!",September 2020,Dun Chaoin Pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616167-d8656102-Reviews-Dun_Chaoin_Pier-Dunquin_Dingle_Peninsula_County_Kerry.html,"Dunquin, Ireland",attractions,4.0,5.0

Amazing drive with fantastic scenery,"Whilst staying in Tralee for a few days, we had to drive the Conor Pass and it did not disappoint. We were lucky it was a lovely sunny day, the scenery was amazing and the drive was both exciting and terrifying at the same time!
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed it and drove up and down the pass a few times the same day.
We also parked up at the small car park at the waterfall and climbed the rocks up to the lake with more fantastic scenery from up there. Bit of a rocky climb up and down but worth it, especially if you bring a picnic with you.",September 2020,Conor Pass,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g194237-d220146-Reviews-Conor_Pass-Dingle_Peninsula_County_Kerry.html,"Dingle Peninsula, Ireland",attractions,4.0,5.0
Nice comfortable hotel for a stopover,"We stayed here for one night recently. The room was nice, bed was comfortable and the staff were very welcoming and accommodating.
We had some drinks in the lobby that evening which has a lovely relaxing vibe and the bar management and staff were extremely helpful in arranging our seating for us and recommending drinks.
Only slight negative, our room was probably one of the furthest away, bit of a trek especially with heels on and there was only one mini shampoo and shower gel in the bathroom for 2 people which was not sufficient.
I would return though as the hotel is very reasonably priced.",September 2020,Hamlet Court Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1390587-d581955-Reviews-Hamlet_Court_Hotel-Enfield_County_Meath.html,"Enfield, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.5
Overall disappointing experience!,"A group of us came here for a reunion birthday. I had heard great reviews so had great expectations.
Its in the middle of the nowhere, looks good from the outside with good outdoor lighting and seating. The inside is a different story, very compact, very narrow, very tight seating arrangement, very hot. I was looking forward to a steak but did not want a steak on the stone as whilst on the stone the steak keeps cooking and I like it rare, so when I asked if the chef could cook me a rare steak instead of a steak on the stone, I was told that this was not an option!! At the end of the day, I paid for a steak that I cooked/overcooked on a stone myself.
With Covid 19, I found the restrictions in place, not great. The staff had masks but customer mask wearing was not being enforced whilst waiting for seating. The table we were at was very very cramped. The board on which the steak on the stone came out on was so big that each one took over a good portion of the table. We ourselves were so cramped that I was forced to eat without being able to move my elbows from my sides, very very uncomfortable.!
This shack may be more suited to couples, as they cannot cater comfortably and safely for larger groups.",September 2020,The Grill Shack,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g656612-d15196530-Reviews-The_Grill_Shack-Kildare_County_Kildare.html,"Kildare, Ireland",restaurants,3.0,5.0
Beautiful hotel for a romantic escape,"Stayed here recently for our anniversary. Everything about the hotel is lovely and welcoming - the decor, the dogs, the staff, the food. It really is a beautiful hotel with the old castle vibe, antique furniture, paintings and ornaments.
The food was excellent - breakfast in the Stone room, lunch in the Orangery and dinner in O'connells restaurant.
Only thing we noticed on a less positive note but not overly negative were that even though our room was quite big with an amazing 4 poster bed and chandelier, the room itself was very plain and mininalised in regard to furniture, wall art and ornate ceiling when compared with the decor in the public areas of the hotel.
Overall, we would definitely return again for a relaxing break away from everyday life.",September 2020,Ballyseede Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186613-d212896-Reviews-Ballyseede_Castle-Tralee_County_Kerry.html,"Tralee, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.5
Wonderful homely hospitality in rural Tipperary,We called in here one evening for a meal while out discovering the local area. We got a wonderful warm welcome upon arrival. Great control measures set up to keep on top of Covid19 (automatic temperature check upon entry along with sign in details and Sanitiser). The atmosphere was lovely and homely with some locals who also popped in for a bite to eat. Everyone was very pleasent and chatty while maintaining social distancing. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. And the pints of Guinness were too nice (according to my husband). We had a really nice relaxing evening and I'm already planning our return.,August 2020,Paddy Kinnane's Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186636-d15343932-Reviews-Paddy_Kinnane_s_Pub-County_Tipperary.html,"County Tipperary, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Located in the absolute middle of the Burren,"I had heard about this Perfumery and always wanted to visit. After a long drive on tiny windy roads we arrived in the middle of no where. Nice secluded set up, the Perfumery itself is quite small. There is a little tea shop also with seating area outside. We probably stayed approx. 20 minutes. Unfortunately we didn't like any of the perfumes, but that's just our particular scent preference, I suppose.
For us, it was a wasted journey unfortunately. Scenery locally was nice though.

Disappointing experience overall,"Lucky we didn't have to travel far from our accommodation to visit here. Our son discovered the Burren Smokehouse Salmon in our B&B for breakfast so we thought he would like to visit where it came from.
Upon entry we were told best to go next door to get the tour and video, only to discover it was 8 euro each to do so. In all fairness, we like their Salmon but not that much.
Went back into the very un-exciting gift shop, bought some Salmon and cheese and left, feeling not very overwhelmed.
Overall very disappointing experience.
Beautiful Salmon, but that's where the experience ends.",July 2020,Burren Smokehouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g212090-d214813-Reviews-Burren_Smokehouse-Lisdoonvarna_The_Burren_County_Clare.html,"Lisdoonvarna, Ireland",attractions,3.0,4.0
Lovely experience overall,"Called in here for an afternoon. Really lovely experience. The folk village is lovely for couples or families.
Lovely walk around the folk park visiting the old style cottages and old Irish streets and buildings and to see the old way of life.

Great way to spend a day out with family or friends.

Good hotel (for families with younger kids),"Stayed here for 2 nights with our teenage son. Lovely hotel, nice decor, nice rooms, friendly staff. Good breakfast and good dinners.
It was very busy, lots of families with young kids which is great if you have young kids yourself.
For us, we would have preferred a quieter hotel in general, lots of noise from kids in general and unfortunately for us some very loud and naughty kids in the room next to us but that is not the hotel's fault I am aware.
Tip: would not recommend for a couple. Or if you have older teenage children, request a room on a no children floor, if there is one.",July 2020,Maldron Hotel Galway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g212512-d212626-Reviews-Maldron_Hotel_Galway-Oranmore_Galway_County_Galway_Western_Ireland.html,"Oranmore, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.0

Average service and food!!,"Called in here for breakfast with our family just before Christmas. There was only one staff member taking the orders, serving the tables and working on the till. The place was pretty full and the waitress/server seemed to be very stressed and not really in the Christmas spirit! After we ordered, our food took quite some time to come out and when I received mine, it was only lukewarm. The breakfast itself was minimalist, lack of mushrooms and beans.

Got the little red train into the 1st and only stop, got out here for the walking tour which mainly consisted of hanging around waiting for our tour guide while she multitasked tours for other groups in different languages as a favour for tour guide mates.

Beautiful basilica but no time allowed to enjoy,We queued a short time for entry and once we got in we realised you had to keep walking with the flow of people. It was difficult to stop and enjoy the architecture as there were so many people who had to keep walking and no where to sit. There was a tiny prayer area at the far right hand side of the church and the whole middle seating area of the chuch was reserved for groups who paid for a tour.

"Beautiful bedroom, amazing view!",We booked this hotel for 2 nights as part of our wedding anniversary holiday. We got an amazing room upgrade from the hotel. The room was in a separate building a few minutes walk from the hotel but it was an absolutely amazing room as it looked straight onto St. Mark's Square. The room itself was large and very ornate with a lovely big comfy bed and double windows giving us the most amazing view of St. Mark's Basilica from the comfort of our room.

Worst pasta dish ever!!,"Had lunch here recently with friends on a short trip to Munich.

Also on the morning of our departure, we asked for help from the receptionist with our boarding pass for our flight and to be honest, she was about as helpful as a 3 year would have been on the reception desk, she did her upmost best to help every one else, maybe because she didn't know how to help or maybe she just couldn't be bothered, i think it was a bit of both to be honest.

Negative in the coffee dock, tables were not cleared and used cutlery (not ours) was left on our table throughout our time there which was not very pleasent to see or smell.",February 2019,The Horse & Jockey Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g319786-d291337-Reviews-The_Horse_Jockey_Hotel-Thurles_County_Tipperary.html,"Thurles, Ireland",hotels,3.0,4.0
Bit disappointing!,"I used to eat here for lunch each time we visited Kilkenny. We returned this weekend and decided to come here for lunch. First thing I noticed was a significant increase in price. I thought for what we received was quite overpriced and the food quality was average, nothing special. On a positive n o te, the serving staff were quite friendly and the decor lovely but on my next visit to Kilkenny I would probably eat elsewhere.",February 2019,Cafe Nostalgia Kilkenny,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186616-d3536345-Reviews-Cafe_Nostalgia_Kilkenny-Kilkenny_County_Kilkenny.html,"Kilkenny, Ireland",restaurants,3.0,3.5
"Delicious cake, nice atmosphere","Found this little chocolate cafe while out walking one evening with my family. It was very busy but too much yummy chocolate and cakes on display not to leave without sitting down and trying something. It's a very chilled out cafe with lots of friends socialising. The cake was excellent and choice of hot chocolate was amazing. Only negative, a dog came in with its owner and was letting off a lot of unpleasant dog wind, which made us leave as the smell was quite unbearable!!!",January 2019,Chocolate House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190356-d3404968-Reviews-Chocolate_House-Luxembourg_City.html,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Nice modern hotel with spacious rooms,"Stayed here for a work night out recently. The room was nice, modern and well decorated. Only issue is that there seemed to be a smell of sewage coming from the bathroom which wasent very pleasent as it lingered in the bedroom. Breakfast the next morning was ok. We arrived down approx. 45 minutes before it ended and many of the hot food buffet trays were empty and they were not refilled. I stayed here previously and it was the same situation with breakfast, so no improvement there. On a more positive note, The reception staff very really friendly and chatty.",December 2018,Clonmel Park Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g212095-d619338-Reviews-Clonmel_Park_Hotel-Clonmel_County_Tipperary.html,"Clonmel, Ireland",hotels,3.0,3.5
"Nice restaurant, good atmosphere","Had a work lunch here recently with colleagues. Decor was nice and a good warm welcome from the host. Food was served pretty quick, main course was nice, I wasent overly impressed with the stuffing in the turkey and ham, a bit rubbery. Apart from that main course was satisfactory. Dessert was very well presented and quite generous. Overall, staff were very attentive and there was a nice atmosphere.",December 2018,Befani's Restaurant & Townhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g212095-d1598476-Reviews-Befani_s_Restaurant_Townhouse-Clonmel_County_Tipperary.html,"Clonmel, Ireland",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Unusual experience,"Visited here on a recent day trip. Nice medieval theme and the staff really got into character. The soup/broth was lovely. The meat on the bone was only ok, unless you love cinnamon which it seemed to be cooked in and overpowered the taste of the meat. Nice atmosphere and warm and cosy, great place to come in from the cold, Have a bowl of soup and warm your body!",December 2018,III Draakon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274958-d3471536-Reviews-III_Draakon-Tallinn_Harju_County.html,"Tallinn, Estonia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Only Irish part of this pub is the name!!,"Visited here on a day trip to Tallinn, stopped in for a drink. The lady behind the bar was either Estonian or finnish and not overly welcoming. We tried to start a general conversation with her but she showed no interest. The decor of the pub was also boring. As I mentioned in my review title, the only Irish thing about this pub is it's name and as an Irish person myself that's very disappointing! I would not return..",December 2018,Mad Murphy's Iiri pubi & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274958-d9729066-Reviews-Mad_Murphy_s_Iiri_pubi_Grill-Tallinn_Harju_County.html,"Tallinn, Estonia",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Interesting experience,"We recently took the Viking Line from Helsinki to Tallinn as a family. The boat was pretty full of mainly middle aged and more mature adults. We sat at the back of the boat, where there was a stage and dance floor the band came on and it was like being at a wedding with all the older folk waltzing non stop. Then the band took a break and it was time for bingo. It was a new experience for us but overall very pleasent and good fun. The sailing was smooth enough also.",December 2018,Viking Line - Day Cruises,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d1641317-Reviews-Viking_Line_Day_Cruises-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,4.0,4.0
Nice views of city,"Went on the skywheel on 6th December which is finnish independence day with my 13 year old son. They were giving a free glass of champagne to adults before 7pm, we visited around 5.30pm but I got offered no free glass of champagne, maybe because I wasent finnish!! But I still paid the same price as everyone else on that day. It was night time, so nice to see the city lit up from a height. You cant stand in the pods so you sit, relax and take in the view of the city and harbour. We got 4 turns on it, not sure what the norm is but it was very quiet when we visited.",December 2018,SkyWheel Helsinki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d7077681-Reviews-SkyWheel_Helsinki-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,3.0,4.0
Very basic...,"Visited here recently. Staff were friendly enough but very young and lacking knowledge of Helsinki. The room was like a hospital room and the beds were awful, like beds you would find in an army barracks, thin mattress with a hard board underneath, worst few nights sleep we've ever had!!!! Four of us sharing a room and we all woke up with aches and pains. One member of our group had to sleep on a sofa bed, which was full of lumps and bumps and the staff could not offer us any additional bedding to make it more comfortable. All in all, we would not not return here again, a good nights sleep you won't get!!",December 2018,Eurohostel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189934-d2040833-Reviews-Eurohostel-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",hotels,2.0,4.0
"Nice hotel, good location","I stayed here for one night recently. Reception staff was friendly and helpful. Bar staff were pleasent but seem to have a lack of experience and training.

Nice cafe with outdoor seating,"On a recent walk around the city we decided to have some lunch here. We sat outside in the square which was nice in the sunshine and just to relax and take in everything going on around us. The food was nice, the wraps and baguettes were freshly made to order and the french fries were quite tasty. The waitress was not overly friendly, very business like and not big on conversation but pleasant all the same. The food here was very reasonably priced which is always a bonus.",September 2018,Picnic cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187151-d4067667-Reviews-Picnic_cafe-Carcassonne_Center_Carcassonne_Aude_Occitanie.html,"Carcassonne Center, France",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Nice Irish bar for a refreshing drink,"We called in here while out walking one afternoon, met a lovely Irish lady behind the bar who served us some nice cool drinks from lovely cooled glasses which was an added bonus.

Average....,"Myself and my husband had lunch here one day during our trip to the city. The fries were the only positive really, nice homemade fries but for us, that was the only positive. We got a ham and cheese panini each and it was definitely a pre made panini that the kitchen staff just heated in their oven.It was really really bad and tasteless....so bad that my husband couldn't finish his as hungry as he was.

Wonderful gem of a restaurant in the Medieval city,"Love this restaurant so much that we ate here each night of our recent visit to Carcassonne. The old world charm and warm welcoming atmosphere is amazing. The steaks cooked over the open fire making it one of the best steaks i have ever eaten. Very relaxed atmosphere, no problem to eat your meal and then sit back with a glass of delicious red wine and enjoy the wonderful musicians. The manager and waitress were very pleasant, attentive and friendly. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Medieval city.",September 2018,L' Ostal des Troubadours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187151-d1118040-Reviews-L_Ostal_des_Troubadours-Carcassonne_Center_Carcassonne_Aude_Occitanie.html,"Carcassonne Center, France",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Food very greasy!,"We called in here for a chicken and chips takeaway for the family. We waited approx. 25 minutes for the food on a Tuesday evening and it seemed pretty quiet. The chips were fine, curry sauce lovely but the chicken was bad, very greasy and salty. We didn't enjoy it and threw 3 pieces of chicken away as none of us wanted to eat it!! We also got some plastic cups for our drinks but the cups were not very clean with a hair in one of them. Unfortunately we would not return here for a meal, rather go up the road to the other chippie near the traffic lights!",August 2018,Tasty Spice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1405304-d14196150-Reviews-Tasty_Spice-Abbeyleix_County_Laois.html,"Abbeyleix, Ireland",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Amazing,"We've been to the Cliffs of Moher previously and got caught up in the €8 charge per person in a car for the car park. This time we discovered Hags head, by taking the left hand turn coming from lahinch approx 1/2 kilometre from the main tourist zone (signed posted coastal walk). It cost us €2 in total to park in the farmhouse, 15 minute walk then from there to peace and quiet and fantastic views off the beaten track!! We were even lucky enough to witness a couple get married at the edge of the cliffs, it was such an amazing experience.",June 2018,Cliffs of Moher,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1184916-d214806-Reviews-Cliffs_of_Moher-Liscannor_County_Clare.html,"Liscannor, Ireland",attractions,4.0,4.5
