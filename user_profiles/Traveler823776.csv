"Usually lovely, but if it’s busy...I wouldn’t bother",Arrived in new quay on good Friday (very sunny and busy) however walked over at 12.30 and by then there were no pasties left and the lady working there rudely mentioned that she wasn’t turning the ovens on again for the remainder of the day. Very disappointing as they’ve been shut all this time and was this not a golden opportunity? In the five minutes we stood outside lots of people turned away also,April 2021,Pasty Pasty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1093682-d2365599-Reviews-Pasty_Pasty-New_Quay_Ceredigion_Wales.html,"New Quay, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Lovely food and drinks but absolutely ROASTING,Had a really nice meal and lovely 2 4 1 cocktails there however it was 30° on the day we went and they sat us on a table next to a boiling hot radiator! Unfortunately they couldn’t turn it off and couldn’t move us for a while so it was a very very hot and uncomfortable few hours. Staff are very friendly and atmosphere is great though :),August 2020,Slug & Lettuce,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186460-d7996051-Reviews-Slug_Lettuce-Cardiff_South_Wales_Wales.html,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5

Very interesting and lots of fun!,"My boyfriend and I travelled to Amsterdam and went on 3 of the free walking tours. We went on the food tour, the classic tour and the red light district tour. The food tour was guided by Marius and it was very interesting and we got to try many different foods. The tours are tip based due to them being free however and we were unsure how much to leave. We left the same amount that others on the tour left for Marius thinking that that would be fine however after being a nice, informative tour guide, he looked disgusted at the tip and did not thank us which was upsetting. However, the red light district tour was with Jacob and was really interesting and informative! We learned a lot about the district and what goes on there and he was a funny man! The classic tour was our favourite as our tour guide Lennart was funny and knew a lot about Amsterdam. He made the tour interactive and interesting, taking us round many streets in Amsterdam. Would highly recommend these tours as they really immerse you into the history and areas of Amsterdam!",August 2019,Free Walking Tours Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d7932225-Reviews-Free_Walking_Tours_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Great fun, interesting and lots of free chocolate!","My boyfriend and I went to this chocolate museum (€8.50 for students, think it’s a Euro more for adult tickets) and thoroughly enjoyed it! It took longer than anticipated to complete (about 2 hours) which was great as it’s definitely value for money! It was so interesting with fun scanners for information and there’s a room where you can try all different chocolates (and as much as you want!) there was also a demonstration as to how filled chocolates are made (and a taster at the end!) which was so fun to watch! Would definitely go again if we return to Brussels and we definitely recommend!",August 2019,Choco-Story: The Chocolate Museum in Brussels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g188644-d13678513-Choco_Story_The_Chocolate_Museum_in_Brussels-Brussels.html,"Brussels, Belgium",activities,5.0,4.0
