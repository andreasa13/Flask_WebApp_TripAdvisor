Totally awesome,It was such an amazing experience and to be able to drive on the other side of the road was totally cool! Staff was super friendly and did an excellent job at guiding us when we went of track...they even ordered us a taxi for to be able to get back to St. Julian.,April 2019,Rolling Geeks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g674784-d6867425-Reviews-Rolling_Geeks-Birgu_Vittoriosa_Island_of_Malta.html,"Island of Malta, Malta",attractions,5.0,5.0
Horrible,"We pre paid this hotel with our vacation package, not realizing it was the
Economy room which basically looked like a prison cell. Very outdated and poorly decorated. A computer screen on the wall for a TV. It was extremely depressing...We immediately got on Hotels.com and booked a better hotel and did not care that we lost some money! The staff were mediocre and did not know how to deal with guests that were unhappy and checking out. We returned the metal key to the young lady at the front desk but she did not want to or did not know how to check us out or give us any proof that we had checked out, even though the room was paid in full for 4 days.",April 2019,Sliema Marina Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190327-d264934-Reviews-Sliema_Marina_Hotel-Sliema_Island_of_Malta.html,"Island of Malta, Malta",hotels,1.0,3.5
