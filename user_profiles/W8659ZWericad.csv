Experience greek history in its best,"Wear comfortable clothing, expecially in the heat as there is a bit of a walk. Me and my partner walked from central athens, ir was very hot and we were carrying heavy backpacks but the tiredness dissipated after arriving at the top and seeing this breathtaking sight. Absolutely amazing.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wonderful!,"Me and my partner booked this while in Athens for one week and this was our favourite day our of all the 7. Amazing experience.
It was fun and super relaxing. You are given time for swimming and also historial insights by the staff who goes above and beyond.
Couldnt recommend it highly enough.",October 2019,Athens Private Luxury Catamaran Cruise with Traditional Greek Meal and BBQ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d15040737-Athens_Private_Luxury_Catamaran_Cruise_with_Traditional_Greek_Meal_and_BBQ-Athens_.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
Enjoyable experience,"An enjoyable experience overall if you are tight for time and want to visit some greek islands. The islands themselves are lovely and well worth the visit but unfortunately due to the ammount of ground the cruise covers you are unable to spend much time in them. For our second island we had around 45 minutes and less than 2 hours in the other 2.

Tours on the islands are not included. I wish this had been a bit clearer. I found that the cost should have covered a bit more than lunch and the cruise and it wasnt really fair to make us pay extra for guided tours ( I found these overpriced in general ). While booking online I was told to select my pick up hotel (there was no mention of extra costs) but on my confirmation it said that I would have to pay an extra â‚¬12 per person if I wanted this.

Overal it was a lovely day, the islands are beautiful and the cruise facilities very comfortable but would be good if they made all the prices a bit clearer.",October 2019,Full Day Cruise to Greek Islands from Athens: Poros - Hydra - Aegina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g3695532-d13857583-Full_Day_Cruise_to_Greek_Islands_from_Athens_Poros_Hydra_Aegina-Paleo_Faliro_Atti.html,"Paleo Faliro, Greece",activities,4.0,3.5
