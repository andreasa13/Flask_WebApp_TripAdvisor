Terrible stay,"We stayed there just to catch a flight next day and the hotel rooms are dirty, small, smelly, very bad maintained, staff is rude and the food not good, as a Mexican I felt very bad since this hotel brand used to be good before, now it is terrible and really expensive, the location is the only thing convenient in front of the airport, but it is really not good, not recommendable at all!!",April 2020,Camino Real Aeropuerto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150800-d219144-Reviews-Camino_Real_Aeropuerto-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html,"Mexico City, Mexico",hotels,1.0,3.5
Poor and Expensive,"We stayed there just to catch a flight next day and the location is the only convenience thing of this place. The hotel is bad maintain (as pretty much everything else in India), all chairs of the suite were broken!!, food was terrible, sewage smelly in the bathroom and the food terrible. For the price of this place, it is really not worth it, not at an acceptable level of comfort and overall pleasant stay. Don’t recommend it.",April 2020,Taj Bangalore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2546117-d9702903-Reviews-Taj_Bangalore-Devanhalli_Bangalore_Rural_District_Karnataka.html,"Devanhalli, India",hotels,2.0,4.5
Excellent dining!,"We visited recently this restaurant and it has become one of our preferred ones in Hyderabad. The ambience is very good, the food really nice, very tasty and well prepared and the staff is very kind and mindful.
Fully recommended!",March 2020,Ohm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297586-d6216329-Reviews-Ohm-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html,"Hyderabad, India",restaurants,5.0,4.5
We have been visiting this,"We have been visiting this place 3 times along 1 Year that we live in HYD, but the review I’m afraid is still poor. Same as it happens in India, food is full of spices, Indian flavor and chili all over the dishes, even when you ask not spicy they only reduce the amount but the chili is still there. There is no evolution on the dishes and cleanliness is always an issue in India, dirty plates, cutlery, so we always order water to ‘clean’ them before use (widely recommended if you are in India). A bit similar with all international hotel chains in here, India food is a real problem if you don’t like their flavors and smells, really the only safe option is home-cooking. Sad but true",February 2020,Zega,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297586-d8816456-Reviews-Zega-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html,"Hyderabad, India",restaurants,2.0,5.0
Nice but crowded,"We visited the Burj Khalifa at the Top on the top floors 154-153-152. The tower is nice, however on the top is desorganized and too crowded, it doesn’t worth the price honestly, which is expensive. If you visit this, try on a time where not much crowd is seen, otherwise is impossible to see. The glass windows are dirty and not cleaned often, toilets dirty and no paper, besides the nice architecture and installations, honestly I’m disappointed about the maintenance and organization of the tour and the people, the lounge is very crowded. Personnel there is strongly focused to sell and move people out, so do your best to enjoy. On top of course nice views of the city but Dubai is not as impressive as other cities like Shanghai, so don’t expect really much from the scenery.",January 2020,Burj Khalifa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d676922-Reviews-Burj_Khalifa-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,3.0,4.5
"Just OK, but very expensive for what it is","We stayed at this hotel in Mykonos, the place is overall clean but the rooms are very basic, with the typical decoration of Greece hotels that helps them a bit on the standardization, but sacrificing the comfort, the room was very basic, not so comfortable and too many bugs and mosquitoes. The location is far from the town and this hotel does not offer a shuttle service, so location is not so convenient, the sea is across the street but depending on the villa you may or not have a good view, instead, you see a lot of country side, dirty and not really nice. The pool water is not tempered but very cold in fact so not OK if you are not into cold water, especially on this place that it is very windy. Overall is decent but definitely too expensive for what you get. Not the good experience we expected for what we paid.",October 2019,Katikies Mykonos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g805488-d12829570-Reviews-Katikies_Mykonos-Agios_Ioannis_Diakoftis_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,3.0,5.0
Great hotel location - but too expensive,"The hotel is in a great location, nice views if you are careful on which suite you are assigned, but overall Santorini is really overrated, this place is not the exception, the rooms are nice but not really nice, definitely not worth the price which is unbelievable high. The staff is nice in occasions and in others really rude, they don’t realize the price you are paying. Objectively, not a good balance for what you pay.",October 2019,Andronis Luxury Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482941-d657033-Reviews-Andronis_Luxury_Suites-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,3.0,5.0
"Old, but great location","The hotel is old, rooms not very well maintained, hot water is not steady, quite noisy and room layout not very pleasant, however, the location is the big benefit of this place, it is located very near to the Plaka area and you can find many shopping streets, restaurants and souvenirs shops all by walking distance. A good option if the other Electra is not available",October 2019,Electra Palace Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228901-Reviews-Electra_Palace_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.5
Very good place and food,"We ate at this place after a long walking day, the food is great, the tables outside allows you to eat calmly and fresh, the beers are really cold and the food is amazing, if you are in the neighborhood, don’t miss this place to eat. The grilled cheese is amazing!!!",October 2019,Trattoria Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2073639-Reviews-Trattoria_Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Amazing place,"We visited the Acropolis and we were totally amazed with the magnificent constructions, all place is full of ancient history and can be felt. It will easily take you more than 1.5 hours, you must use right hiking shoes since the floor is uneven and slippery, all marble on floor is already highly polished, so be careful and there are no toilets around, think twice before you load yourself with water. Definitely the top 1 place in Athens",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
