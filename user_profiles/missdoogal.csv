Fab hotel,"We have just returned from a fabulous week at this charming hotel! We had a warm welcome from Krisanthi on reception when we arrived and the hotel has the cutest little dog called Rosa! Our room was great, the hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff are wonderful! Andreas sorted out any queries we had including car hire and showing us the best route to visit Samaria Gorge and the wonderful coastline! The food at the hotel is lovely. We wouldn’t hesitate to return to this hotel! We loved everything about it!!",September 2020,Hotel Kedrissos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189415-d662915-Reviews-Hotel_Kedrissos-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great holiday,"We arrived back from the Riu Playacar last week after a 2 week holiday! We had a fabulous time at this hotel! Food was plentiful, altho I wouldn’t bother with the themed restaurants as they’re quite mediocre and u get the same food in the main restaurant! Drinks were great, with a good selection including some branded drinks too!
This hotel is spotlessly clean with a really clean pool and beach area. Not sure what previous reviews are referring to as this is one of the cleanest beaches I’ve seen. Maybe they just picked a bad day?? The only thing I would say is that the rooms seem to have a dampness to them over by the balcony windows and we found that when we got home even our clean clothes had to be washed as they had an almost musty smell to them. Which brings me on to the rooms. They are clean and housekeeping do a great job of keeping them that way. I think for a five star hotel they should have tea/coffee making facilities and no-one topped up our optics at all for the whole holiday. We ran out of rum on day 7 and it was never replaced. But it’s not a big issue. What is an issue however is the air con. We both experienced breathing problems whenever it was switched on, my sister coughed non stop until in the end we decided to use the fan only in the room. That was adequate but we were in block 5 and I don’t think we were the only ones that had issues with the air con.
All in all, this was a fab holiday, the staff were great, the entertainment team were amazing and they all work really hard! If it wasn’t for the air con and the musty room smell on my clothes I’d have given it 5 out of 5",December 2019,Hotel Riu Playacar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150812-d219165-Reviews-Hotel_Riu_Playacar-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Great historical site, poor attitude staff","This site is wonderful as far as its magnificence from a historical viewpoint goes. What let’s it down however, is the rude ignorant staff that are employed there. Their concept of disabilities is almost victorian in approach, in fact it’s almost non existent. That along with their ill manners is the only thing that lets it down. So don’t let it put you off visiting a beautiful temple. I’m sure things will improve once they bring their attitude into line with the rest of the 21st century.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
