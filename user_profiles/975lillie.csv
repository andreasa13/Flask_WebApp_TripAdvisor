Awful!,What a horrible experience. Clogged toilets from already half way over. Toilet water floating inside the cabin. Filthy and run down boat. Got no words.

Awful drinks,"The food at hard rock is always amazing. The drinks on this place on the otherhand.. no, just no. Ended up leaving them almost untouched.

Nice,"This was a great hotel, but it could be so much more. The curtains had spots and there were Lots of scratches on the interior that ruined the impression a little bit.

No,"Went here to try one of the crazy flavours this time, but the concept of the chaos at this place almost made us give up again.
The is had plenty of ice crystals in it, not good. And the staff, seriously would it kill you to brighten up a bit?!",August 2019,Giolitti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1061568-Reviews-Giolitti-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,2.0,4.5

Surprisingly dissapointing,"From seeing the pictures it was a big suprise to see the room. The bathroom had sloppy work done, and the towel hangers kept falling off, as did the showerhead who wasnt fasten securely. And the concept of open bathroom glass wall into the bed, just dont go here on your first cuple vacation.. small room and very dark and small entrance. Seen worse, but definitely not the best. Good location, thats a plus!",August 2019,Navona Stay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d17437872-Reviews-Navona_Stay-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,3.0,4.5
