Just by looking at it, is ""please eat and enjoy me"". I also ordered the chocolate volcano - you need to order that. I was over the and will definitely order that again. A suggestion if you are two you can order a veggie and share it between two people. We also enjoy the fairy lights in Clearwater it made it really a nice,relaxing evening out.

Break-Away,"I love the bush and enjoyed my stay. Just very hot and the fans worked overtime. Please just make sure that if you want to rest and not driving around, come prepared. They do not have a restaurant on the premises. The swimming pool area is a nice place to relax with a very nice view. I just think they must be stricter when it comes to enforcing the rules. People played loud music from their cars and the drinking at the swimming out of glasses also was a downer. Accidents can happen easily. Otherwise, I enjoyed my time there.

Holiday,"We stayed for 2 nights in Athens. We arrived late at the Polis Grand Hotel. We just repack our bags and decided we need to buy another bag (do more shopping in Santorini and Mykonos). The one thing we misjudged is the fact that it get much later darker. So we think it's still early then it's nearly 2100. On our first night in Athens we ate at the rooftop restaurant in our hotel. The service was excellent and our waiter was very professional and efficient. That was a stunning experience with the most spectacular views. We tried to take pictures but it is just not the same. The well lit Parthenon on the Acropolis was a fabulous site to see. Also the point where they said you could see the nicest sunset from. Then we know that's why we decided to visit the Parthenon. We went with a guided city tour with the main attraction Acropolis hill with Parthenon. The museum was also included on this tour. just take note at the museum if you have a big bag or a backpack you were supposed to handed in for safekeeping you are not allowed to enter the museum with your backpack.

They would drop you at the hotel but we chose to walk in the Plaka district where all the shops were. Guys and this is really a place where you can walk around and shop and eat. One of the things you can remember is that there is certain shops that have a tax-free section. You must ask for for it because most of the time they don't tell you we only realised it when it was nearly at the end of our shopping. The one thing I was glad I had on was comfortable shoes you need comfortable shoes guys because my feet was aching. We decided to walk back to the hotel otherwise we going to miss too much. We found nice affordable suitcases close to Polis Grand hotel and we were very very glad. At the hotel I just flopped on the bed with my feet in the air. We decided after our nice experience at the rooftop restaurant we're going to end of our visit there as well. This time we didn't had a very nice experience our waitress took our order but when we received our food we realise she did not really understand. We ate in stages first me and then my friend. Except for this it was a very nice experience. The people working at the front desk was really efficient and professional and they will always assisting us and telling us what is the best option. Thanks guys we really appreciate it and we enjoyed our stay with you.

The last day we had a few hours to kill before our transfer to the airport back to South Africa. We went to the Hondos center that everybody was talking about and we had a real royal time there. Here you also can do tax free shopping. I think this is a much better option than to buy at the airport. Just keep your eyes on the clock if you only have a few hours to give.",October 2019,Athens Visitor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d17396199-Reviews-Athens_Visitor-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,5.0
Holiday,There is a lot of shops where you can buy souveneers. Bargain for prices and if you have your passport with you and buy more than 50 euros you can goods for tax free.

this is a audio place for people with families there is a lot of activities for children. There is also activities for the whole family and everybody can take part at the main swimming pool. The only negative thing that I can say is at the warm swimming pool there's is a funny smell.

Holiday in the West Coast,"We enjoyed our stay in Club Mykonos. The staff were professional when we booked in. The only thing that I would suggest is that they explain to you the different restaurants in the club Mykonos facility. We stayed in a one room sleep 4. At first we thought it will be a bunk bed. Big was our surprise 2 twin beds in the room (we asked for twin beds), and a double bed in the living are. I love it. The unit was clean and ready when we arrived. We made use of the security and tv services. They were also professional and friendly. Explained everything thing in detail. Well done. The facilities at Mykonos were well maintained. I also made use of their gym. The under roof swimming pool can be noisy especially when there is a lot of kids. The restaurants and supermarket was close to our unit.

Holiday,"Natal Spa is a nice place to go to. The food of the restaurant is good. Prices differ depending on what you order. They also have a bistro where you can enjoy something to eat. They have different swimming pools. Only 2 of them are warm, I would love it if one of the big were pools also heated. The put put court is a little bit wierd, but we still enjoyed the game. A little bit expensive, think that if they made it cheaper it would attract more people. The unit we stayed in was nice and we enjoyed the time. We stayed in the self-catering houses. If you stay in self-catering units you need to take your food with, also your charcoal you are not allowed to use wood. The only things available to buy is milk and bread, chocolates. So go prepared if you want to make your own meals. The road to Paulpietersburg is not really the best. They also have a wellness center, with message salon, gym, hybrid pool (was under maintenance), steam room, sauna and jacuzzi. Please just ask at reception if you qualify for complementary tickets, otherwise it can be expensive. The scenery was fabulous and they have a short hiking trail.
