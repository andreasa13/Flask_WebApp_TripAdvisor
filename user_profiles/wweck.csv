Wow. Had an Inferno pizza,Wow. Had an Inferno pizza which was probably the best pizza I ever had. The mussels were amazing as well. The last time I had food this good was when I worked in the Bari area of Italy.

Fabulous Cruise with an exception,"We originally went on a whale watching tour and loved it. We saw so many whales and Johnny and crew were great. Based on that we went on the sunset Cruise. That was also great except the dinner. The amount of rice and fish was so minuscule that it was hardly even an appetizer. For a fishing port where fish is cheap this is hardly the area to cut corners. Maybe this cruise should be solely sold as a sunset cruise without dinner as everything else was great. Thanks to Johnny and crew again.

Awesome food,As a consultant who travels and dines at many different restaurants this one is a gem. Had the mussels as an appetizer and the Osso Bucco as the main and both were exceptional. The ambiance of this place is great. Would definitely visit over and over again.

Fantastic Hotel in a great location,"We stayed a couple nights at this beautiful hotel and enjoyed the Harbour view, the welcoming staff and the proximity to the Old Town. I was happy that we did not stay in the Old Town as it is overrun with tourists. This hotel has fantastic facilities, rooms and breakfast. Again I want to mention how great the people are at this hotel.

One of the best highlights of our 3 week vacation!,"As soon as you stepped onboard with George you knew who was in charge. He is extremely knowledgeable and got everyone to participate in some manner. Unfortunately the winds were not favourable for sailing that day but it didn’t really matter. George showed us a great time and educated us on the islands and many other things. He went swimming with us and took underwater photos of the group. To top it off he made a CD of the trip for our memories. What a great day!

"Good food, tiny portions, big price",We saw the trip advisor comments and are trying to understand the rating. Extremely small portions and big price on a limited menu. Had a hard time picking anything off this menu. Left the restaurant hungry. Would not recommend. They asked us to give them a good rating on leaving. That explains a whole bunch. 6 raviolis on their main course.

"Fantastic Hotel, even better people","We just completed a 2 night stay here and loved this hotel. The hotel personnel were extremely friendly and took care of every little detail. The close proximity to the Acropolis, shopping and restaurants made it easy to get around on foot. The day and nighttime view of the Acropolis from the hotel was amazing.

Nice hotel if you like a 70’s style,"I travel extensively being a consultant and live in and out of hotels. We were here for our Granddaughters dance competition and requested a room in the main building with a walkout.

Since the competition started early and we brought our dog we requested an early checkin. What we received at the front desk was a rude condescending lady who did absolutely nothing to accommodate us. As we waited in the lobby, until there was almost nobody left waiting, we still did not receive our room even though it was getting close to 4.

I asked a few times and got nothing but a rude response in return. When we finally got our room there were many issues. I will try to list most of them but there are many. Plugs not working, fridge the size of a breadbox (this apparently was their biggest suite which we didn’t request in the first place), no microwave, bathroom straight out of the 70’s where your knees are at your chin the toilet is so low, cigarette butts all over outside our door, TV’s with such a poor picture quality you could hardly see them, ventilation preprogrammed so you couldn’t adjust the heat, etc, etc. They did have a table for 8 which was weird since nothing for supporting a meal was in this unit. No dishes or cutlery.

Checking out on Sunday they deactivate your room key at 11. We requested to stay an extra hour since our granddaughter had a dane at 11:45. Flat out no by the same person working the desk on Friday. At this point she got a piece of our mind.

Total for the 2 night stay in a substandard hotel with a rude individual at the front desk $610. We will never stay at the hotel again nor recommend it. We were not the only ones with many gribes about this hotel. They have much to learn about customer service. Spend some money upgrading the place!

Horrible Food at Big Prices,We went there for lunch having been to Outback’s in the US and expected the same quality. What we got was a beef dip sandwich which defied logic as to how bad it was. The dipping sauce was plain weird and the gravy for the fries was untouchable. All the other people at our table could not believe how then can serve such bad food.

This place is unbelievable,"We ordered takeout after reading all the good reviews about this place. The reviews were not incorrect as the fish and chips were amazing. Actually ""Best Ever"" period!

What a joke!,This was the biggest waste of money that we spent on a shore excursion from our cruise. Not only is this a kiddie train but there is nothing of interest to see along the way. They let us off to view a nonexistent waterfall after walking up a bunch of steps. The narrative was taped and was equally boring. You end up at an over priced gift shop. No thanks!

Not an All-inclusive as advertised,"This is a really nice resort but the practice of giving the dining patrons a cheque that shows how much the meal would cost trying to solicit a tip. They want you to sign your name and room number and give a tip. If they don't get one they let you know they are dissatisfied. They even come after you if you forgot to sign the bill. This is very disturbing for a so-called ""All-Inclusive"".

Great Time,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to both parks with our grandkids. Very expensive adventure as nobody is as skilled as the parks in Florida in removing money from your wallets. We knew it would be expensive and hot but the looks on our grandkids face when they saw all the Harry Potter attractions was priceless. One thing I would recommend is that they have more sitting areas with benches. This was sorely lacking and we had to sit on the ground or on uncomfortable stone walls.,July 2016,Universal Studios Florida,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d102432-Reviews-Universal_Studios_Florida-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.5

Total lack of quality wine choices,We went in here to get a glass of wine before dinner and found the wine choices extremely lacking. The ambiance was nice so we decided to order a 1/2 litre of Sangria which was on the selection board. The bartender poured 3/4 of the litre with cheap white wine and the topped it off with white cranberry juice. A couple pieces of crappy fruit and that's what was served. Horrible was the taste. We've been to Spain so we definitely know what constitutes Sangria. That was so pathetic. I don't care if you have 200 choices of beer as it is a wine bar that should have quality wines. Don't serve other alternatives if you do not make sure they are quality beverages.,February 2016,Vineyards Wine Bar Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155004-d710542-Reviews-Vineyards_Wine_Bar_Bistro-Ottawa_Ontario.html,"Ottawa, Canada",restaurants,1.0,4.0
"Friendly, helpful staff","We just spent two weeks at the Marriott in Barbados and had a very good experience. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. The staff are exceptional, especially Stefan and Ulanda, with their help, friendliness, and courteous manner. The location is close to most main attractions and a very good variety of restaurants.
Not being directly on the water is not a big problem as it is a short walk across the street. The beach is okay but there are so many fabulous beaches here that it is a shame to spend your water time there. Having a car made island exploration very accessible.

I don't get the rating!,"We ate there based on the excellent rating on TA but were totally shocked. As people who travel extensively and eat out very frequently this restaurant was very disappointing. Here is my checklist:
Ambience: non-existent. Paper table cloth on long tables that cram people together.
Friendliness: bordering on rude trying to rush you out of the restaurant to maximize profits from essentially a fast food experience.
Food: Very tasty but very small portions and extremely expensive for what is delivered. Just seafood and no sides such as starches and vegetables. Bread and seafood and that is it!
Service: good since they want you to eat and get out quickly. No waiting for the bill.

If you want to eat fast food seafood in a clinical environment with no personality and are prepared to spend 100 Euros then this is your place. Very pathetic.",September 2014,Cervejaria Ramiro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d2703366-Reviews-Cervejaria_Ramiro-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Great apartment type resort,We stayed at this resort for only 1 night but wished we had stayed longer. Everything was immaculate and the view of the ocean was very nice. We sat on our balcony and enjoyed a glass of wine while viewing the turquoise waters. The apartment was very spacious and had all the amenities if you decided to stay in and cook for yourself. The beach and the town were within easy walking distance. We got great recommendations for places to eat from the guy at reception.

Dishonest employees,My wife and I had dinner at this restaurant on December 19th prior to returning back to Ontario. While I have frequented this restaurant for business or pleasure many times I cannot express enough how disappointed I was in a dishonest employee that works there. My wife had forgot her purse at the restaurant and did not realize this fact until the next day. Since we were departing Calgary early in the AM we figured we would call the restaurant and have them deliver the purse to the Marriott Residence Inn that day. We had been staying at the Marriott for the better part of 2013 and knew the front desk staff very well. They could then courier it to our home. Since the restaurant was 5 minutes away my wife politely asked if the manager could perform this task. The purse was not delivered until the following day and was minus the $600 my wife had taken from the bank to buy Christmas gifts for our grandkids. Based on where we were in the restaurant and the fact that it was slow we figured everything would be okay. Unfortunately it was not locked in the safe as indicated by the manager as there was a conflicting story about it being with another person up front whom was supposed to deliver the purse. Karma does go around and whoever decided to take that money will hopefully get their fill of bad Karma. I on the other hand will not be frequenting this restaurant for business or pleasure in the future based on how this situation was handled.,December 2013,JOEY Barlow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154913-d705357-Reviews-JOEY_Barlow-Calgary_Alberta.html,"Calgary, Canada",restaurants,1.0,4.0
What happenned to the delicious Mac n Cheese?,Our family went to Hey Lucy's on New Years eve and were disappointed in the Mac n Cheese. This use to be their signature dish and was homemade and delicious. Now after not being there for a number of months we looked forward to ordering this dish. Unfortunately it consisted of a few boiled noodles with some cheese that did not even taste like Mac n Cheese. If that is your new offering we will avoid ordering that dish as frankly I could easily boil a few noodles and grate some cheese on top myself. To the restaurant's credit the pizza was very good but 4 of the 6 people ordered the Mac n Cheese.,December 2013,Hey Lucy Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d685267-Reviews-Hey_Lucy_Cafe-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Toronto, Canada",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"Food is great, everything else not so much!","The food is very good as most people indicate in their reviews. The problems with this place range from the sub-standard location, extremely slow and poor service and the issue with attempting to make reservations. They have 2 reservation numbers and with each of them there is rarely an answer. The phone goes into voicemail where the message is that the mailbox is full and therefore you cannot leave a message. On their website it states to call either one of these numbers but they will not take a reservation from a voicemail.

The reason this restaurant is still in business is that they are in a hotel and probably get many walk up reservations.

Severely Over-priced,This restaurant chain does not have bad wings by any means but I find them to be very small and extremely pricey. In addition their drink prices are out of line with other pub stype restaurants in the area. Basically it is like eating in a cafeteria with big screen TV's. The service is over-the-top as people come by every few seconds to ask how things are. It's one thing to give good service but don't hover over the tables. In other words there are many other better options for pub style dining in the area.,July 2013,Buffalo Wild Wings,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154913-d4267136-Reviews-Buffalo_Wild_Wings-Calgary_Alberta.html,"Calgary, Canada",restaurants,2.0,3.5

Over-priced and not very good,We ordered the Nachos and the Bolognaise and did not mind paying the steep prices providing we got a good meal. The Nachos were pretty sparse with very few toppings and some burnt chips. The Bolognaise was supposed to have Bison and Elk but I think you would have to perform a DNA test to find any of these ingredients. It sounded very good on the menu but did not translate into reality. Overall from a value standpoint this dining experience was a big flop. I would avoid this tourist trap restaurant like the plaque. As for the service the guy tending our table was basically useless and had to have everybody else take care of our requests. They did validate my parking ticket though. Definitely worth the $130 for lunch for 3 people!,March 2013,Lakeview Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154912-d781457-Reviews-Lakeview_Lounge-Lake_Louise_Banff_National_Park_Alberta.html,"Lake Louise, Canada",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Food was good but portions tiny and ambiance lacking,"The food we ordered was very tasty and the presentation was nice but the portions were very small. Both my wife and me left feeling hungry and feeling like we did not get good value for the price. The meatloaf was delicious but unless you have a very small appetite this will not satisfy it. In addition the dining is on cafeteria style tables with plants placed in between to lend a small measure of privacy. Paper napkins for a $$$ place is also not very suitable.
