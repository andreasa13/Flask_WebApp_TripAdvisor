New modern oasis,We stayed here in late November 2019. We had not been warned about the building work right outside our window and the builders started at 8am promptly every morning. Obviously this cannot be avoided by the hotel but just a prewarning. Other than that this hotel was perfect! The location is amazing just a short two minute walk from monastraki metro station and the historic plaka district. There are loads of restaurants and shops nearby and a lift if you don't want to brave the stairs. The room itself was very clean and comfortable and the staff were all lovely. The prices are very good for the quality of the rooms and the location. Couldn't recommend this hotel enough.,November 2019,Bed in Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d14927078-Reviews-Bed_in_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Fantastic!,"We came here for a meal on our birthday as I love Mexican food. We had a bowl of nachos, I had a burrito and my sister the chipotle tacos. Everything was delicious and filling. The inside is decorated, very cool, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would recommend anyone looking for a break from Greek meals to come and try some taqueria Maya!",November 2019,Taqueria Maya Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7736681-Reviews-Taqueria_Maya_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wow wow wow!,We came here after reading the great reviews and were not disappointed! The shop is full of interesting modern and indie art and the owner knows so much about it all! We bought plenty of souvenirs and if I could I'd go back for more!,November 2019,Flaneur Souvenirs & Supplies,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d10643090-Reviews-Flaneur_Souvenirs_Supplies-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Nice place,"We bought a few things here, the style of the stock in this shop is very modern and contemporary. The lady serving was very friendly and helpful. Good if you want something a little different as a souvenir.",November 2019,Forget Me Not,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d7183435-Reviews-Forget_Me_Not-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Wow!,We came here after reading the great reviews and were not disappointed! I had the ground beef and my sister the feta cheese.

Very nice,We stopped here on our first night in Athens. I ordered a baguette and my sister a sandwich. Both were delicious and the service was very good.

Small but interesting!,We stopped here before heading to the ruins and it really helped place some context for what you see. The museum is small but very well curated and we were able to take our time to read about the artifacts (in English) and take photos (no flash). A must if you are visiting the archeological site.,November 2019,Delphi Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d199057-Reviews-Delphi_Archaeological_Museum-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
What a journey!,"We visited Delphi from Athens by bus. You can purchase tickets online or at the bus station. The bus station is difficult to find, and somewhat scary if you are unsure of yourself as we are. We took the metro line towards kifissia getting off at aghios Nikolaos. We then walked a little down the road to find a bridge to cross over the metro line and followed the road back the way we had come and to the right. If you search for ktel bus station you can use Google maps. Once at the station go into the right hand building and to the left if the desks. The first desk on your left is for delphi and here you can buy a return ticket. The bus itself departs from no.7 directly across from the building. The trip takes 3 hours and you will see really beautiful scenery for the last hour or so. Once at Delphi the bus will collect you from the opposite side of the road next to the little travel stand. There is a lovely little shop at the end of the street before you head down the road towards the ruins and museum.
The ruins are set in a breathtaking mountain view and although the signage is a little dated and the floor very uneven we clambored to the top. It is not difficult to imagine how impressive it must have been in its heyday, although I would recommend reading up about the various buildings before visiting and bring a map!
The site of Athena's temple is away from the main area a little further down the road.
Make sure to take plenty of water and comfortable shoes as it takes a long time to fully explore the site and there is little shade.
Delphi is a must visit for those seeking a touch of history.",November 2019,Delphi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d523823-Reviews-Delphi-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Really good!,"First of all, how to get here from Athens when you cannot drive! We took the M3 line towards the airport on the metro to duokissis plakentias and then immediately upon coming to ground level took the bus 319 from the circular platform. Your ath.ena card will work here too. As with many things in Greece it can be a little unclear but the stop is to your left as you come up the stairs. Ride the bus for 31 stops to just outside the children's play place at the edge of smart park. There is a bus stop a little down the road from a dirt road through what looks like a winery field. This is the road to the zoo! Once you reach the entrance the park is easy to get around however as it is clearly in the process of modernisation and expansion you end up with such a strange and worrisome entrance.
As I mentioned the park is going through a process of change and some animal exhibits suffer from their age. However it is clear that modern zoo standards are being reached for and the animals themselves are well cared for. I believe in 5 years time this zoo will really be a gem. There are many walkthrough exhibits and free shows and the layout is easy to follow. They do provide a map at the entrance when you buy your tickets which is clear and helpful (unlike some other zoo maps) there are vending machines for water and snacks dotted around and a second smaller zoo shop just outside the dolphins. The shows we saw (flying birds and dolphins) were mainly in Greek but no less exciting to see for it. Prices were fair and actually somewhat cheaper compared to most zoos. Overall very good!",November 2019,Attica Zoological Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562627-d566806-Reviews-Attica_Zoological_Park-Spata_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Spata, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Really friendly,"We stopped here for tea on our way back to our hotel as I had noticed all the good reviews. The staff are extremely friendly (if a little too attentive) and we ordered a lamb kebab with yogurt and chicken kebabs. Both were delicious, the lamp slightly spicy and served on a bed of pitta chips. We also had two iced coffees and were gifted a shot of Ouzo and not one but two little chocolate mousse each! The prices are very good, the service could be a little too much if you are as socially anxious as we are but nothing that would stop me from giving this place 5 stars!",November 2019,All That Jatz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10426009-Reviews-All_That_Jatz-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Buy the 30€ ticket!,If you buy the 30€ monumus ticket this site is well worth the trek. There are great information boards around site and it is well looked after. If you are expecting a visual experience then you may be disappointed as some imagination is required. It is right next to the Christian and Byzantine museum if you are visiting one it's easy to hop across to the other.,November 2019,Aristotle's Lyceum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d7718083-Reviews-Aristotle_s_Lyceum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.0
What history!,The free audio guides are a bargain for the 5€ entry price and climbing up to the top of the stadium imagining the Olympics of the day is magical!

Impressive,The temple ruins are huge! It's really easy to imagine the temple in its heyday. There are also ruins of Roman baths on the site.

Great little place!,"We came here due to the good reviews and were not disappointed. The ladies serving were very helpful and friendly, also very apologetic as the server accidentally dropped an entire glass of water down my legs! We ordered the lemon sweet poffies and a plate of feta savory too. They were great at giving us recommendations, such as to what the sweet lemon first to pair with the double Greek coffees we had ordered and also the cherry tomatoes instead of a sauce to go with the feta poffies. Really excellent service at only 13€ total!! They also gave us a couple of sweets as a apology for the water which I found very thoughtful. Would recommend to anybody visiting the national gardens or the ruins nearby.",November 2019,BiteBox,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14771398-Reviews-BiteBox-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Excellent big portions!,"We popped in here for a quick bite to take back to the hotel and really got our money's worth! You order your noodles, toppings, sauce and ingredients yourself and are treated to a huge box! I had egg noodles with chicken, mushroom and coconut curry sauce and my sister had egg noodles, duck, oyster sauce and sesame seeds. Both were delicious and filling.

Got our order wrong,"We stopped here for breakfast on our first day in Athens. We asked for the Greek scrambled eggs with feta and tomato but unfortunately were given the scrambled eggs with salmon, avacado and pickle. We didn't want to cause a fuss as the servers were very helpful and friendly and ate our meals but we were obviously a little disappointed. Overall it was a okay breakfast, the food tastes good and the coffee was strong all for a fair price. I'd recommend double checking that your order is understood first though!",November 2019,The brunch factory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d17762500-Reviews-The_brunch_factory-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Interesting but not breathtaking,This site suffers from a lack of information. If you know what you are looking at it is a interesting space but unfortunately there is limited resources there to see.

Another wonderful site,"Although lacking a little in the great descriptions and stories present at the acropolis, the agora is another must see attraction in Athens.

A real modern treasure,"I have wanted to visit the acropolis museum since I had read about its opening on a travel blogs years ago. It is 10€ entry and despite its relatively small size it includes beautifully presented relics, monuments, and statues from the acropolis ruins as well as sitting on top of the restored ruins of an entire neighborhood! Very informative and with English descriptions throughout.

The most stunning views,"This is a must see when visiting Athens. The walk up the hill can be slippy and difficult if you are not stable on your feet.

"Good, cheap, not far from the brudnell social club","We stayed here one night to see a gig at brudnell social club. It can be s bit of trek toget to but for the price, and especially if you are a cricket fan, you could do much worse. There is private parking on site and check in was easy, the room was clean and tidy with a view of the cricket pitch.

Amazing comfort,Although this hotel was a little further out from the centre of Dublin than I would have liked there is nothing else I can criticise about the Herbert park hotel. The beds were wonderfully comfortable and everything was clean and tidy. Check in did include a 100 euro hold on my card for possible expenses during our stay which I was not expecting but otherwise the staff were friendly and helpful.

Wow wow wow!!,"I have visited the zoo in every city I've ever visited and this must be one of the best! Renovations have made this a very modern conservation centre. There is plenty of information on stands by each enclosure giving facts about the species within, their conservation status, and what Dublin zoo is doing to help. This is a great tool to show the public just how important zoo's are to the conservation of our many animal species. The zoo is well laid out in beautiful greenery and with two lakes! Many times f the enclosures are designed with plenty of space for the animals to rest and hide with enrichment activities everywhere. There is plenty for the zoo's human visitors to do too with play areas, cafes, toilets and seating available throughout the park.

The long room is stunning!,We popped in here as advised for a must see in Dublin and we're not disappointed. There is a plethora of information on the book of Kell's in the slightly tight space and then a shirt staircase leads to the long room which is really the highlight of the visit if you are anything like us and appreciate architecture.
