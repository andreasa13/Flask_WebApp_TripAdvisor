Less crowded off season,"We were here as a couple with two families who have 4 kids. If you have a small vehicle carriage for your baby or a small child and you are not entering through the main entrance, they direct you to go there and to leave a carriage there(they save it for you). However we were here out of the season so we had reduced price feom 20 eur too 10 eur (1.11-31.3.). They have free toilets on the highest point of the hill. Ancient buildings are really nice and worth to pay to see them. We had cloudy weather. The view over the Athene was still spectacular. It wasnt so crowded until we reached the top. There were at least three cats all over the place.",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great refreshing after visiting Acropola,"We were returning from our trip visiting the main attraction in Athene-Acropola with another family (young couple with 2 kids)and on our way back(walking through main entrance and turning right, on our way there was a street full of cats) we stopped here because chocolate fountain brought attention to us. Hard to miss. They have lots of coffee to go, nice waitress and lot of choice of ice creams which looked like their home made but I am not sure. I ate raspberry and amarena ice cream. Also the strawberry was ok and dark chocolate.",November 2019,Arte Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d17679816-Reviews-Arte_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Great view,"I bought standard tickets from official website (27 £ for 1 ticket) and also booked the term of visit( exact date and hour -recommended). Queue was reasonable, even though it looked crowded (Sunday, after lunch time) and we hadnt had priority tickets we were on attraction in less than 8 minutes. The whole experience (including 4D-for free) was priceless. The place around the London eye is very crowded. You can buy a London Eye album for 20£ with 1 personal photo they take for you or for 25£ (two photos). Photo album is very beautiful memory on London Eye!",November 2019,London Eye,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d553603-Reviews-London_Eye-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
English breakfast,"We ate breakfast both on Saturday and Sunday because we were satisfied with food and service for the first time. We came between 10.a.m-11.a.m and we were lucky to get a free table twice before it was full. We ate english breakfast wich was very saturated (big portion). We drank organic chamomile tea (very good) and americano coffee (average). Second time I ate florentine breakfast which very good except for the sauce. I had vegi smoothie, but I was a bit disappointed between the portion I got and money I paid.",November 2019,Polo Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d3236017-Reviews-Polo_Bar-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Positive experience- Breakfast,"We had accommodation in the area of Bethnal Green (a neighbourhood with lots of junk food) so when we searched for a healthier breakfast (around 10.30.a.m. on Monday) we stopped here .
Staff was very friendly, with a smile on their face and fast service. They offer fresh smoothies (I took a spinach one and it was great). I ate florentine breakfast and it was ok, maybe a bit unsalted. My boyfriend ordered an english breakfast which was good but they forgot to bring a dessert which was included in menu.
I especially liked how stuff treated elderly people (locals), very polite and with care.",November 2019,Astro Cafe & Brunch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d15207122-Reviews-Astro_Cafe_Brunch-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Almost 5-ica,"We ordered:
- šopska salata; vegetable cutted on a very small pieces, it was a bit sour
- čevapi (10); big portion with bread and onions; good value for money
We waited for a table approximately 10 minutes. When we ordered, we waited for food about 15 minutes, but it was really full place. You cant do reservation.",August 2019,Petica Cevabzinica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294450-d2080749-Reviews-Petica_Cevabzinica-Sarajevo_Sarajevo_Canton_Federation_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.html,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Disappointed,"It is close to Museum of crimes against humanity and genicide but you can be easily misled.
The waiter noticed us soon, but we waited more than 5 minutes to be served. But when we finally ordered the food, it camed surprisingly fast. But we were disappointed, because food didnt taste well. Vegetable pizza was tasteless, carbonara pasta was like a starter (small portion), lasagna al forno was to spicy and pasta was overly cooked.",August 2019,Cheers Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294450-d6931283-Reviews-Cheers_Pub-Sarajevo_Sarajevo_Canton_Federation_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.html,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",restaurants,2.0,3.0
Ancient place,"Extraordinary place, rated 4 because it is quite small place and it gets easily crowded in the evening hours. We were politely asked to join two guests (the three of us) to sit at the same table. Afterwards (when two guests left) another group of people joined us at the table. Waiter asked us again politely. You cant order tea or coffee after 6 pm. The mixed drinks were not strong enough. :)
The inner decoration is unique. They actually have goldfish.",August 2019,Zlatna Ribica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294450-d1223297-Reviews-Zlatna_Ribica-Sarajevo_Sarajevo_Canton_Federation_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.html,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina",attractions,4.0,4.5

Breakfast,"We took coffee and breakfast in Staklo. The first time it was ok, but the second time there was unfriendly waitress.
