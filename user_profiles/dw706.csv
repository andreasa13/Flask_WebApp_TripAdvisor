Club Class to Cancun,"Check in
• WOW in a word – never have we been in less of a line, with less hassle and greater efficiency in long time at Toronto International that is saying something – well done
• Check in at Cancun was equally as efficient and the process was smooth (though there were considerably more people)
Lounges
• Lounge access in both airports was nice. The Toronto lounge is known to us and was as expected however the lounge in Cancun leaves much to be desired. Food selection there was minimal, service poor and slow and the ladies working really seemed like the would rather be anywhere else than there – a miss for sure
Flights
• Excellent from start to finish in both directions
• Seats are comfortable, service was personalized and friendly
• Food was not the best or the worst airline food but it did the job
• In-flight films were current and in abundance
General
• We would definitely fly with class with Air Transat again – without hesitation, the only caveat being flights in duration of less than 5 hrs – I would not fly overseas without being able to fully recline to attempt sleep",February 2020,Air Transat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729014-Reviews-Air-Transat,World,flights,5.0,3.5
Feb 11 -21 2020 - Valentine & Birthday trip for 2,"Upon arrival we were ushered to our Serenity Club check-in and Jesus introduced himself and offered us a cold beverage! Lovely start. Our room was ready and we were escorted to our suite by Berto our 'butler' for the 10 days. He was charming, while we walked to our room, he shared information about the hotel, restaurants, pools etc. We selected a Luxury Collection - Serenity Club Jr. Suite Swim-out Ocean Front and were not disappointed! It looks just like the pictures on their web site. Spacious bathroom, King bed, couch, desk, mini fridge and wonderful deck/pool access! Would totally recommend that class of room as it was heavenly. Our first breakfast we tried the special Serenity Club - Vistas restaurant and were terrifically disappointed!! We waited 1 1/2 hr before we even got a beverage and that was incorrect - we are 2, we ordered 2 coffee/2 orange juice and were FINALLY served 1 of each. We left and never returned!!! We advised Berto of the issues and were advised that it would be passed along to management. Whilst we did notice an improved presence of mgr. and staff we also heard from other guests that the service had not really improved. I would suggest to the management that if they wish to 'sell' this as a value add that they truly improved the service. We noted that the server we had was moved to the buffet breakfast restaurant subsequently but that could just be a shift rotation. Regardless the breakfast at the buffet is excellent! The 2 ladies cooking omelets/eggs a la carte are charming and very skilled (rarely braking a yolk) plenty of variety and well presented/prepared! The Snack Shack by the quite pool was great for burgers/hot dogs, chips/salsa and even cievche!! Now if you are looking for an improvement on the usual buffet style dinners and are willing to dress appropriately - you are going to have a lovely time! Our favourite restaurant was Olios - quite, elegant and an excellent menu that, for the most part was very well executed. We dined there 4 of the 10 meals. I will share a sample of what you could be offered - fois grais, artichoke soup, duck breast. All excellent i only wish that the duck had been cooked consistently - I asked for medium rare and only once got it that way the other 2 times, well done. A shame really but I think that the 'wedding' groups impacted both kitchen and staff. Agua Bendita was fun and if you are willing to pay you can upgrade to a premium cut of beef. Satsu's sushi/maki was very good because the fish was so fresh. I would recommend for raw fish lovers to ask for the 'boat' which they don't really advertise but they will do for you if you order carefully. Vora Mar was great for lunch - amazing a la carte taco, pasta and wonderful fresh cold seafood as well as the regular items you should expect. Dinner was not as successful however. Over all I would say that there appears to be a significant effort made on sourcing and providing a superior food experience, well done! I would offer this with regard to purchasing wine - ensure you have what you list, we asked for an Italian Pinot on our first night and it was sold out - we never again asked. We would have had a bottle at every dinner so that is a loss for the hotel, additionally if you reduce your prices a bit on the wine and take less of a margin you would likely sell more to couples who are like minded. They advertise that a chef’s treat will be delivered daily – we got it only once! I would suggest you change the web site or ensure that you deliver on your promise. Pools are well maintained/huge, but we had our walk out and stayed there most days! The coffee shop in the lobby is terrific! Love that idea and it is very well executed! We enjoyed it very much. Bars are abundant, bartenders are very skilled with their mixology! Our only challenge was the overwhelming noise of the 'party' groups. Enjoy yourselves folks but not at the expense of everyone else! The gym was well appointed however it might be too small for those wanted to avail themselves. I tried and it was always busy – yes in the morning but that is when most folks want to exercise! We saw Berto our butler daily and he was very helpful in arranging my husband's golf round, making my birthday a very special day indeed and providing assistance/advice on everything when needed. I would like to thank him very much for his care/consideration during our stay! Overall I would highly recommend this resort to anyone seeking a break and cares for a more premium experience.",February 2020,Haven Riviera Cancun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d13499839-Reviews-Haven_Riviera_Cancun-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Great room, perfect location - staff needs improvement","Well, convenient is an understatement because within 2 minutes you are in the departures area of the airport! Room was well appointed and very quite, check in was efficient and well done. The lounge - well to say that they were less than efficient is an understatement - our drinks took forever to come and when we were hoping for a second we found, after 40 minutes of trying to get a server and then get the server to check on our order that the bartender had crumpled it up and thrown it away!!! We got a 'sorry' and 1/2 off those drinks but the manger didn't apologize and frankly he was more interested in talking with the waitress than watching the guests. Dinner was good, although before the shift change and the ladies joined I watched the server get bread for guests using his fingers (not washed/gloved or with a napkin) and place them in the bread basket. So glad we didn't eat the bread! Breakfast was included in our room rate and they let you know you are a second class citizen. You are directed (not escorted) the the back upper level and rather than giving you a linen napkin you are lucky to get cocktail paper napkins with which you are to wipe your mouth. Over all I would say that this could be a great property with staff improvements - hygiene/efficiency and courtesy but they have a monopoly for location. Be aware and you will manage fine .. but don't expect a 'great' experience.",September 2019,Sofitel Athens Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562627-d285733-Reviews-Sofitel_Athens_Airport-Spata_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Spata, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.5

Lovely hotel with great team but ... not location location location,"Sadly this was a recommendation from travel professionals not my pick - the missing element for us was location! It was overlooking the caldera but sadly so far from both Fira and Oia - where you want to be. Rooms were very well appointed, we had an hot tub and our room was over the dinning room and it was very quite! Team was great, friendly check-in/out, bar and wait staff excellent! I would suggest that they could advise you of the hot cook a la carte options at breakfast which they did not do for us.

Sadly we had a mishap with one of our dinners - a kitchen malfunction and Giannis was quick to act. He explained the problem, which must have been very embarrassing but he handled it with such grace and aplomb we didn't mind a bit.

A little bit of heaven,"A remarkable location just above the village! Greeted with such warmth - we felt welcome immediately! Our room was ready and so were we - Kynthos Junior Suite Rm #701 was our 'home' for the next 3 nights! So private, so quite and so well appointed! Luxury all the way. The pictures on the web site looked just like our suite! Breakfast was great - buffet but if you ask for eggs cooked differently or even pancakes, they will bring them happily. We were astonished that after only 1 visit to the dining room that the wonderful team knew our names/room # and treated us so kindly. This property is beautiful but what really makes this place special are the people supporting your vacation. The only thing that could be mentioned was that the bar is pool side and with the wind it can be a bit chilly, perhaps they could use the area below the buffet area for drinks before dinner? They are kind, friendly, gentle and so helpful without being prying or ever-present! We so enjoyed the pool side and the dinners in Baos were amazing.

The 1st stop on our Grecian Odyssey,"The room was ready, early check in, with THANKS! We were greeted warmly and efficiently and escorted to our suite. We had a Premier Suite #563 and it was great! Two very distinct rooms with a couch, tv, desk, round table, coffee table before entering the ensuite bedroom with ample wardrobe space! (just like the picture on the web site) We had 4 nights to spend with the team at the Divani Caravel and we were not disappointed! There was one odd thing that I must attribute to the air quality in the rooms/hallways. I found that I would awaken dizzy and when out and about it would disappear but return in the night. I was not dehydrated and am not prone to vertigo. Just a friendly warning to sensitive travelers. Truly the team is what makes this property special .. we got to know Dimitris, Yannis and Giorgos & were delighted by their service. Thank you, gentlemen, for your care and attention.

Very Good but.....,"My husband and I were staying in a suite in the hotel and were very excited to dine at Rebelle, however our excitement soon turned a bit sour. We were seated and the female server greeted us warmly and was very friendly. The unfortunate part was that our table was in the back of the restaurant where the roof is dramatically lower and therefore the sound was amplified 10 fold. WOW was it noisy. We certainly were not going to enjoy a quite dinner! The 2 couples in the corner could be heard clear across the room!!! We started with cocktails, ordered a bottle of wine and a dozen oysters for me and the Spanish octopus for my husband. I was so disappointed that in a seafood restaurant that they DIDN'T have the skill, knowledge or bothered to make the effort to release each oyster from the shell. I was shocked that I had to do all 12 myself. The octopus was a bit chewy for his taste. We then ordered the beef filet x 2. They were cooked perfectly, the Bearnaise sauce was delicious and the side of asparagus was a perfect accompaniment. No dessert but I wanted hot tea and was told that they didn't have it? Odd because at breakfast I was able to get hot tea - do they not have the ability to share provisions, one might ponder? Regardless - I would say it was a well done meal overall, but having dined twice at Ostra (having their seafood tower both times) I would suggest Rebelle pull up their socks or have more folks dine at the competition.

We had cocktails to start and were left to relax and enjoy as we contemplated the menu. We decided on the TOWER of seafood - and I have to tell you - we were not disappointed! My husband ordered a lovely bottle of wine and so our culinary adventure began! Oysters, shucked perfectly, briny and firm, lobster tails that were sweet and tender, the best of the Texas Gulf Shrimps, wonderfully juicy crab claws and a ceviche that was tangy and so delicious. As we enjoyed our evenings - Nicholas was there to aid, offer friendly conversation and to keep our wine glasses filled. He was always there/but never there as he has truly mastered the art of excellent table service for his guests! We enjoyed our meal - sorry I can't tell you about the desserts as we had no room left - the portions were very generous and so very very good! Coffee to follow and we left having had a wonderful dining experience. I would truly recommend this restaurant for anyone - yes on the pricey side however with amazing seafood/great service and quality surroundings one should expect to be pampered and pleased and my goodness - we where!

Rouge the next Ryanair,"What can I say...it was cramped, uncomfortable and barely enough room for the flight attendants to get the carts down the aisle.

It was a turn around and not well cleaned for the return. No amenities are offered, couldn't book the business class (which we wanted), no entertainment and the space behind the seat where the video used to be is now used by inconsiderate passengers for their garbage! Also, we had many folks with connecting OVS destinations - MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT and TELL people to sit down (because you have identified those that need to get off) so that they can .. as usual the less experienced travelers JUMPED UP and blocked the aisles. This can be avoided if your Flight team handle the situation but we had what appeared to be 'quite' attendants that couldn't handle the situation.
I would like to say to Air Canada - DO NOT push these planes for flights on your overseas routes because if you do your improved reputation will be DESTROYED. Was that fight not enough to show you that passengers opinions matter? Rouge is Sub Par and would make me consider NOT using AC Vacations to book my holiday.",February 2019,Air Canada Rouge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8808634-Reviews-Air-Canada-Rouge,World,flights,3.0,3.0

Location is everything,"This hotel is in an amazing spot - short walk to Anne Frank House, Jewish Quarter, Rembrandt House, red light district, the Palace or the Diamonds are Forever bridge! Check-in was fine. We were told that we had a 'butler' who introduced himself and then showed us to our suite. We paid for a room which we didn't occupy from the previous day, so we could (due to an horrible flight departure from our previous location) shower, breakfast and rest but we had to the floor staff open our door and say oh you haven't checked out yet? Well if we paid for the room - it should have been empty and recorded on the house keeping log? The suite was over looking the canal on the top floor - very nice. Well appointed with a wonderful bathroom. The only draw back is that there is really NO where to unpack? What happened to the dresser? or a bed side table with a drawer? If you are staying more than 2 days and have more luggage - good luck unpacking! Strange trend which I hope will be reversed. The breakfast selection was generous but staff could use a lesson in customer service .. they are SLOW!! We over heard one guest say he had been waiting 30 minutes and he was annoyed and rightfully so. We had excellent service but we were not in a rush (thank goodness) The bar was great, the bar tender was friendly and mixed a great martini! Bridges BarBistro was delicious. Fun concept for nibblers/finger food.

Spectacular Resort,"Wow, a luxury resort to be sure. Location is wonderful. Property is wonderful, hospitality, service and support all top notch, as you would expect from a Fairmont property. We were greeted, luggage loaded to a wagon and escorted to the check in desk. A short wait was enhanced by a welcome beverage, leis and smiles. Check in was prompt, friendly and efficient and we were take to our suite immediately. A smart design, fantastic amenities and comfort helped you to enjoy your time in the suite but the real joy came from the location, pools, beach, restaurants and services. There is nothing you couldn’t do or enjoy. Dinner at Nick’s Fish Market was a perfect. A table overlooking the water, well timed and thoughtful service made my birthday dinner very special indeed. Caffe Ciao Bakery and Market was super convenient and a great alternative for a quick snack or meal! Golf close by, shopping a walk or a courtesy drive away you have so much to do and see! Book in advance and get the full benefit of everything this resort and it’s wonderful team of Fairmont Ambassadors can provide.

Lovely setting with superb service,"A birthday celebration with a twist. Sadly my husband was under the weather but I enjoyed my dinner solo. I was warmly greeted with birthday wishes and then shown to our reserved table overlooking the pacific and grounds of the hotel. I indicated that I was not in a rush and the service was excellent! Martini to savor with the view then I orders the oysters - another 1/2 dozen to follow and then the fresh fish all washed down with a half bottle of french wine. The food was, as expected presented beautifully and delicious what I would like to highlight was the wonderful service I received as a single woman. To some this may not seem like a note worthy point but as a business woman who has dined alone, I wanted to congratulate the team who helped me to enjoy my dinner in-spite of knowing that my husband was suffering from flu in our suite.

Check in was quick and efficient and we arrived to a comforting and well-appointed room. If I had to find something to comment upon, it would be the tissues in the bathroom - one ply. A lovely corner room which was very comfortable was our ‘home’ for the 4 nights. Location is great to see Universal and Warner Brother's studio. Free Shuttle to Universal and a $15-20 cab ride to Warner Brothers. Excellent! Breakfast is amazing and I know why they are famous for their Steak/Seafood Buffet - make a reservation!!

Paradise Lost?,"What should have been the highlight of our trip turned out to be an huge disappointment. Some of that can't be shouldered by the resort as Sunday was torrential rain and flooding however the resort's reaction to that natural occurrence was an unmitigated FAIL. Check in was friendly and efficient, the room, is just as the pictures show, perfect then - unpacking and getting ready for our dinner at Pa'akai, the safe batteries failed with all our items locked inside. Security had to break it open and replace it but the black grease and mess from that activity were never cleaned up .. so that closet became unusable. The Bell man, in an attempt to help no doubt, turned the temperature in the fridge to the highest setting (unbeknownst to us) and the glass water bottle they provide you with froze and shattered. I cleaned up the glass shards, left a note for housekeeping but no thanks for the warning or another bottle were provided. The dinner was perfect, food delicious and service top notch, expensive but it was expected, what wasn't was people wearing flip flops or baseball caps for fine dining. Then Saturday am, round of golf - terrific, sunning by the pool and a great dinner at Lei Lei's. Great food, good value and friendly service! Then the rains came and Sunday was a blow out...everything cancelled - not the resorts fault however the main building has NO lunch facilities (save a snack bar) and with the pool restaurant/bar flooded, the beach restaurant unreachable due to weather and the golf course again unreachable due to weather - what did the resort do? Not much really - what should have been a preplanned and executable alternative was fumbled. What should have happened was that the KULA GRILLE should have been immediately reopened, staffed and lunch service should have been supported, what did happen was a mess. I would recommend a look, but unless you are 100% outdoor related or have 100% perfect weather ... give this a pass until they learn to execute a plan.",February 2018,Turtle Bay Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60651-d87158-Reviews-Turtle_Bay_Resort-Kahuku_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",hotels,3.0,4.5
Pre show dinner and so much more....,"Great service and a wonderful dinner await you. We started with a lovely bottle of wine and then ordered our seafood tower which is served not as you would think in a tiered platter but in a beautiful sculpture placed in the centre of our table. As you can imagine it was a site to behold but even more importantly the seafood was cooked properly and was delicious. We had 1/2 lobster, crab, oysters, shrimp, mussels and clams. We tucked in and every so often a wonderful member of staff would top up our wine glasses and ask if we required anything. We had a lovely time. We ended with a Caesar salad which was well presented with real bacon and parmesan - which you would expect! We shall return most definitely.

My salad - Mr. Hamilton's Lentils was very good but sadly it was missing the feta crumble which I realize too late to ask for a correction but I would suggest that the kitchen take greater care.

Rooms are spacious and comfortable but no free Wi-Fi unless you have a 'status' in your rewards membership or you are in the lobby or fitness centre - you can pay for it if you chose. Over all and where it is most important is your team and they were all outstanding. Check-in, Concierge, Restaurant and Bar team members all very good. Friendly service with a smile but your most outstanding team member for us was the doorman helping with cabs - he had the biggest smile and was a true ambassador for your hotel. I would recommend this hotel for it's location/proximity to theatres and also advise that you will be paying for that convenience.
