"Not in safe area-bordels around, no wall on toilets",I am surprised how someone can destroy very well done rooms and facilities with stupid toilet design with glass wall!!! We were with kids and it was not possible to use toilet/shower without the other leave the room:-(. I bought glue tape and use sheet and put it over the glass wall as they don’t have curtain on glass wall:-(. Restoran is not walking during day/night and the area is full of strange young people walking around and visiting prostitutes in brothels,January 2020,Vitruvius Smart Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d16643769-Reviews-Vitruvius_Smart_Hotel_Spa-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,2.0,4.0
Great experience- very good taste,"My kids were enjoying it, so we had to return back send day. Would probably come back again. Great experience showing preparation process. We have been offered free coffee waiting for kids to be served by personnel assisting service. This was very pleasant and not usual experience, so I am thankful and they bought me with this move (otherwise I would take it somewhere else). Great quality of ice cream.",January 2020,IceRoll Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d15030657-Reviews-IceRoll_Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0

Great small restoran wit very good service,"Service was very good, young people taking care if everything. Food is also nice, kids enjoyed burgers in pitta and homemade potatoes.

Nice value for money,"Solid restoran in touristic crowded part of Athen. Nothing special to mention, but no complaints as well. Moussaka had too much cheese and lower potato- don’t like that way but that is traditional greek moussaka.

Great “Janjetina ispod peke”,"Coming there around 5 pm which was too early to enjoy in speciality (veal cooked/baked four hours), but just on time to enjoy in lamb and potato. Tried also “pastrva” and was delicious as well. Only one (non-experienced) water caused that we had to wait long for orders but food was wounderfull. One hour later restoran was full and additional personel joined so they managed food and order later much better I gues. Prices are very high but I can not complaint as food was very good.

"Great food, risotto and spaghetti to recommend","Food was really great. We did call 30 minutes in advance to reserve as there was 8 of us (4 adults and 4 child). They were really friendly. Food was great especially risotto and spaghetti. Octopus was also nice. Credit Card not accepted which is still shame in some restaurant in Croatia. Take a care of this as this can refuse a lot of people- if I would know in advance, maybe I would not come - it is attitude question. Prices, not so high as quality and size are bringing value.

Touristic place/feeling but great food,"Even thought seafood is great in this place, i would never recommend it to someone looking for experience in dinning. Service is quick and polite, but size of this place, feeling that you are just one-time customer that should eat your experience, pay and go is killing all freshness of seafood.
