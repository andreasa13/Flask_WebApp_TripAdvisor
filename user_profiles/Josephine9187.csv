New scenery Cape Sunio never been image that! Homer will be played by Mel Gibson in a upcoming movie. Swam at a great beach at Astir hotel, clear waters to enjoy r/r. Plenty of pick ups and drop off with different people accompanying me. FIRST, new coffee shop near Acropolis,ZONARS awesome baklava, and view of Parthenon. He scored me reservations at Herodion roof top to hear some of Andrea Bocelli, then to fill in my last 2 days a drive to most serene place for little bit of prayer and sunset at Grand Meteora. Stayed in nice guest house where he arranged lodging. A first again, Holy Trinity long walk down and up but good for soul. Along way back to Athens stopped along sea side for lunch. A female traveling a lone felt very safe. Theodore has a great since of humor, and is very knowledgeable of his country.

Canadian girl's trip,"Thank you Fotis and Ilianna, we had a great time Greece. Appreciated patience in scheduling our trip due to multiple changes. Delphi,Meteora, and southern part of Greece. History put chills down our spines. Awesome sunrises and sunsets each night with awesome weather. Multiple days at the sea, We give Fotis credit for being with 4 women for 5 days. Our friend's that referred Fotis to us was right he allows time to explore each site, provided a schedule for each day, and awesome Greek authentic dining. Ilianna, Fotis speaks very highly of you assisting him with his daily schedule. Both of you do fanstic job providing great hospitality and respect to strangers. Again, if I would return back to Athens, I would call you up for a great tour.
