Fantastic Hotel in a Fantastic City,"I have been to Edinburgh many times but this was my first time at the Balmoral. It will not be my last. I have been missing out on this amazing place. Nothing short of spectacular. Built over 100 years ago as part of the train station. There is even a lift that goes from the Platforms to the Lobby. The hotel is a fantastic stone building like much of the city. It's location is ideal. walking up to the Royal Mile and the Castel or to the shopping and restaurant area.

The interior is of old world but of this century. There are a few venues for tea and a light lunch in the afternoon. the restaurant and bar are very nice as well. The best of all for me is the bar called SCOTCH. It is a whisky bar. well over 100 different bottles of single malt and these guys (all in kilts) really know there whiskies. Spend some time there and its a tour of Scotland. The hotel is not cheap but then the great experiences of life are often not. Oh and don't forget the haggis for breakfast in the restaurant, or the house made smoked salmon. An the indoor pool in the spa is not to be missed.

The location is perfect. Not situated on bussy and noisy Park Lane but right across from Hyde Park, convient walking to the Tube Station, shopping, theaters and great restaurants.

The interiors of the hotel are architectural eye candy. Great finishing’s from public spaces, halls, guest rooms and even the elevators. The room I have is called a conservatory suite which features a patio seating area perfect in nice weather.

The best thing however is the staff. They are friendly, efficient, anticipatory and professional from front desk, management, concierge, and restaurant and bar, spa and room attendants. Nothing left to say other than perfect. They even cleaned my lap top and left a few screen wipes.

Speaking of the Spa, spend time there. Its tenth floor location has spectacular views, the men’s area (and I assume the ladies as well) has all the amenities one could want.

A Great Place for me to call Home when in LA,"I recently spent almost a month at the SLS and After a month at the property, I do think I am in a good position to comment on the property and its operations, especially after my 3 week stay in 2012. In a word: exceptional.

And might I add I think it even better than I remember in 2012 and I was much impressed then.

The physical plant is well maintained, interesting and both relaxing and entertaining at the same time. Very difficult to achieve. Needless to say the food was too good. All the way from room service to the restaurants. The spa was delightful and frankly I think the operations at the pool much improved over 2012.

The best part however of my experience was my contact and service from the people. Many hotel owners have told me over the years one of the best things about Starwood was the training of employees. I agree. And for me this experience was over a long period of time with most all of the departments that have any guest exposure. Management, reservations, front desk, housekeeping, concierge, room service, restaurants, bell service pool people, and the car drivers. All courteous and professional yet fun and delightful.
