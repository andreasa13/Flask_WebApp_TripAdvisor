Alright,Had food here last night and it was all perfectly nice. Service was a little awkward but of a higher standard than normal. Some dishes were overpriced such as the camel meatballs.

Excellent,Can only go on booked tours now. They are quick and leave from the winter park. Winter park has a few coffee shops and a burger king. Really nice park if you want to spend a bit of time having a picnic before or after the tour. The tour is efficient and you are given water and dates as you go. Might want to have a bit of a read before you go if you want lots of information but the guides can give you the general idea.

Old town road,"Had a nice tour and a walk around the old town at night. Not fully finished but you can get the idea. Tour lasts about an hour and you are given very basic information, some water and dates. It's a bit annoying that you have to drive to the winter park to get a bus that will take you there. Has some restaurant s and shops that are nice to visit at night. Not a good idea to take a stroller.",April 2021,Old Town of AlUla,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1802184-d5966052-Reviews-Old_Town_of_AlUla-AlUla_Al_Madinah_Province.html,"AlUla, Saudi Arabia",attractions,4.0,4.5

Worth a look,We went here just before shutting and maybe should have gone earlier. Lovely setting and what we had from the menu was good but maybe a little on the expensive side.

Average,If your expecting your typical Radisson blu then you are going to be disappointed. It's a UK 3 star but a low quality one or a USA 2 star. Service is fine and rooms are clean for the night with an average breakfast. Handy place to stop when driving from Jeddah to Al Ula. Paid extra for business floor and this is a con as the lounge is not open and you get nothing extra don't be tempted.,April 2021,"Radisson Blu Hotel, Yanbu",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298554-d306577-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Yanbu-Yanbu_Al_Madinah_Province.html,"Yanbu, Saudi Arabia",hotels,3.0,3.5
Not good,Some of the worst food I've ever had. Only had nachos and the ones I received were awful. They used one little cube of tomato as salsa and covered the greasy tacos in fake cheese.

Not good,I like wagamama and usually enjoy the food. This was horrid what I had today and didn't taste like any wagamama I've ever had. The gyoza was overdrives and really greasy with a horrid sauce.

Handy,"The hotel is very close to terminal 5 and only a ten minute walk away. Everything is shut at the hotel at the minute so can't use the facilities.

Average,It's a good kebab with decent ingredients. The sides are also pretty nice. The reason it's average is the wait times are long for a fast food place. Timings on deliveroo were continually put back and I waited over an hour and a half and its not that far from me.
