Small but great pizza,"Small restaurant , basic table and chairs but who cares when the pizza are fantastic and with really friendly staff.

Quick thoughts,"Hotel is very central, good breakfast , helpful staff , comfortable bed , Jamie’s restaurant on site , small but good spa and good website for trips . Art Deco style

Downside - the room we had didn’t have a Bath , pizza in Jamie’s were good but Fried fish and chips special was poor ( this was restaurant )

Overall excellent hotel especially helpful staff and great and quiet location",December 2019,Hotel Borg by Keahotels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189970-d207775-Reviews-Hotel_Borg_by_Keahotels-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",hotels,5.0,4.5
Iceland in a box,"We went to the concert call to see the short film Iceland in a box . It lasts about 15 mins and you are sat in a room surrounded by videos playing around you .

A backpackers delight,"I’d describe this place as a backpackers delight , easy to find , no pretensions, good food and at a good price .

The restaurant is in a metal but very warm shack/ shed right next to the harbour . The food primarily is lobster soup and kebabs .

You order when you enter and find a bench with chairs and Wait for the food to arrive . They also sell beer and soft drinks .

It’s pretty basic but don’t be put off . We had 2 scallop kebabs and a salmon kebab plus potato and vegetable kebabs . For two it was perfect .

The fish was fantastically fresh and excellent portions eg a scallop kebab was 6 fresh scallops , each of a decent size .

We didn’t try the soup , but most people seemed to enjoy it around us

It was very cheap for Reykjavík prices , I’d recommend.",November 2019,Saegreifinn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d1209708-Reviews-Saegreifinn-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Nice little restaurant in old town,"Nice little restaurant in the old town , particularly thought the atmosphere was good and the staff helpful and friendly .
We tried some of the local dishes , as a starter we had king prawns with pearl barley. The dish had a nice taste balance but I was disappointed we only had 3 shell off prawns .

For the main we went for the pan fried fish ( plokkfifskur) which consisted of a huge fish cake with new potatoes , salad and lovely local bread all on one plate . Very filling and great to try but probably would choose something different next time .

Overall good ( primarily for the service and atmosphere) but not great , perhaps avoid the local dishes . I should it was very busy and the menu had lots of other choice",November 2019,Messinn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d10094640-Reviews-Messinn-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Perfect sun set,"Just a small bar right on the sea but as every says best sunset view anywhere .

It is a wooden “shack” but better than that , built on the side of the rocks about 5 -10 minute walk around the coastal path from cavtat.

Breakfast after a walk with the dog,"The blue tomato has been around for ever in Rock .
We had a great breakfast after our dog walk along the beach . They have a range of offerings from doorstep bacon / sausage / egg sandwiches to both full English and veggie . My choice was the sandwich and very good it was

Coffee is also excellent and everything comes with a view of the camel estuary

Prices are not cheap and the inside is a bit basic ( by the end of the season ) . However dogs are well looked after including doggy sausages .

"Nice , good atmosphere, overpriced ?","First visit to Barnaby’s on a friends recommendation .

Overall I enjoyed the food , tapas style , excellent/ fab dishes included the mushroom and scallops dishes . For a larger dish we had the pork chop to share , beautifully cooked , but served on its own for £25 .

The clams however weren’t so good

20 oz t bone for £60 and 2/3 of a pint for £4.65 also were expensive .

Overall enjoyable but a bit hit and miss .

The restaurant only has about 25 covers so I guess they can charge the prices .",September 2019,Barnaby's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315948-d14029488-Reviews-Barnaby_s-Padstow_Cornwall_England.html,"Padstow, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Worth a visit,"The vineyard is about 3 miles outside padstow and easy to find .

You can just turn up and sample various wines at £2 each for 40mls . For a tour of the wine making area / walking tour you have to book .

It’s open Wednesday to Sunday only .

We just turned up and the staff were very friendly and welcoming . The outside area is lovely , surrounded by vines obviously , but also large sunflowers , a really nice spot to try a few wines . They also do some food eg cheese board or cold meats . The Spanish ham was exceptional , worth going just for that .

There are 8 + wines to sample with a wide variety of blends. Personally they didn’t grab me and were quite light ( 11 % alcohol) but not unpleasant. It was however nice to sample English wines especially from different grapes.

The vineyard is well worth a try. You can’t beat sitting in the Cornish sunshine , with a glass of wine and good nibbles in a lovely location .",September 2019,Trevibban Mill Vineyard & Orchard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315947-d8494783-Reviews-Trevibban_Mill_Vineyard_Orchard-Wadebridge_Cornwall_England.html,"Wadebridge, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Fantastic view and good food,"This is a great place to have dinner and view the bridge, the views are spectacular and I really liked the individual leather table booths .

We visited on a Wednesday and it wasn’t too busy , I think people are still finding it.

I would recommend the restaurant but the main menu and wine list is upper end pricing for Bristol

There is however a fixed price menu with 3 different options per course and less than £25 for 3 courses.

We had a rump steak and the lamb rump off the main menu. Both were very good and well cooked, the special lamb was particularly good.

There is a wide wine list although my first choice wasn’t available. Wine is a bit pricier but you get what you pay for.

Staff were very friendly with a good head waiter who certainly looked after us very well. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed

Overall well worth a visit

Just a drink but a must visit,"We headed to this restaurant / bar for an early drink to see the view and weren’t disappointed.
It’s on the 28 floor with amazing views of Swansea and the marina on one side and the Gower on the other.

They seem to be keen to attract customers with 2 for £10 summer cocktails and offers on other drinks and food .

We only had a drink but it would be a great place to try for lunch while surveying the views .

Great steak and great value,"A group of us found this restaurant late on a bank holiday Sunday as it was one of the few places still open at 10pm.
It was a great little find , very friendly , helpful staff and big range of steaks and mix grills to have .
My 10oz ribeye was exceptional and great value at £16 . It was really thick , no excess fat and beautifully cooked on the grill in front of you .

The place is a little way from the main night life area and is a bit basic inside but don’t be put off . I haven’t found a better steak for twice the price in many restaurants I’ve tried .

A really little find.

You can also tell it’s popular and good as there was a steady stream of locals just turning up for a late meal .

Last orders I was told was 230 am.

I’d really recommend .",August 2019,Steak By Night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186466-d2078292-Reviews-Steak_By_Night-Swansea_Swansea_County_South_Wales_Wales.html,"Swansea, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Busy even on a Tuesday,"A new restaurant which has already grabbed a good following of customers based on how busy it was on a Tuesday night.
It’s a typical french bistro with a simple but attractive menu.
As well as starters there is a nice selection of bar snacks ( lamb kebabs , bowl of hot prawns or lambs kidneys ) .we had the first two choices which were great.
Mains included aged rump steak , lamb chops and plaice . there was also a brill dish to share . We both however had duck with garlic potatoes and green beans .The duck was perfectly pink .
There was a wide choice of wines including a good range of french wines at fair prices .

Great tapas,"This restaurant is just off the main square in Samos town . Food is typically tapas style so perfect to share various dishes .
Recommended are chicken fillet with mushroom sauce , pork ribs and as a starter fried feta with honey and aubergine done in the oven .
House wine was surprisingly good but do try the local sweet wine .
All dishes are max 5 euros each so overall the bill was very cheap",April 2019,Epikero,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6617883-d6852063-Reviews-Epikero-Vathy_Samos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Samos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good food and what a view,"This restaurant is a must if you want typical Greek food with the added attraction of a perfect night view of the acropolis. The restaurant has a very small outside area but inside is well designed so at least 60% of tables have a great view. It also has glass fronted doors which ensure you can see the view.
Don’t be put off that some photos imply you have to eat outside for the view , you don’t.

Staff are very friendly with perfect English and there is a good range of typical Greek food. The marinated chicken was very good as well as the pork souvlakia . House wine was also good for the price.

The restaurant is on the third floor hence the view but there is a small lift .",April 2019,GH Attikos Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d695906-Reviews-GH_Attikos_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Unmissable,"The acropolis should be on anyone’s bucket list to visit . We went early April ( it’s half price pre March 31 ) and it was busy but not overcrowded .
It is a pretty big area and a fair climb up ( paths are generally a medium incline) . We took nearly 3 hours to walk round .
As well as the obvious bits you also get great views of Athens .
Personally I was amazed when you actually see it all how advanced the Greeks were in 500bc .

The theatre that is used for concerts was also fantastic . I think it’s only on special occasions but would be great to attend.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Perfect for lunch with a view of the acropolis,"We had a simple lunch outside in the sun . Staff were very friendly and food typically Greek. I had pork souvlaki and others had gyros,salad and pitta plus a Caesar salad . The food was great and with a cold beer it was a perfect spot to view the acropolis.

Busy but worth it,"We managed to get into the restaurant via a late booking through our hotel but judged later in the evening , by lots of people waiting , we were lucky to get in and so book early .

The restaurant has an upstairs and downstairs with a nice rustic ( wooden) decor . Staff are very helpful and service is extremely fast.

The pizzas are huge , we shared two between three and the pizza had a lovely thin fresh dough base and were excellent .

There is a big range of different pizzas

I’d also recommend two starters the 30 month hung Parma ham and mozzarella , both absolutely delicious.

There were a few complaints on other reviews about price of filtered water and hurried service but personally I’d ignore them .

Staff do work quickly and food comes very quickly but no pressure to hurry and leave .

The carafe red wine was good and cheap.

Well worth a visit for great simple Italian food",March 2019,Ristorante Pizzeria Du Tunnel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187865-d2066822-Reviews-Ristorante_Pizzeria_Du_Tunnel-Courmayeur_Valle_d_Aosta.html,"Courmayeur, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great. Steaks,"The restaurant is a short 10 minute up hill walk from the centre of the town but well worth it when you get there .

They specialise in steaks with a range of dry aged T bones ( by type of beef , region from and length of hanging) .

We shared a fab chateaubrienn, probably the most tender streak I’ve had .

There is also a wide choice of wines ( a guide book ) or waiter recommendation is useful .

Overall excellent and at busy times either eat early or definitely book .",March 2019,Lo Sciatore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187865-d2169683-Reviews-Lo_Sciatore-Courmayeur_Valle_d_Aosta.html,"Courmayeur, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Disorganised and disappointing,"I visited the Kenny for a friend’s leaving work do . We had a room upstairs and we had to book our choices before we arrived .

Overall the experience wasn’t great , the room was great and private plus there appeared plenty of staff looking after us . However the cooking and the organisation was poor .
starters came out at different times . My choice of terrine was unexciting and most importantly I was one of the unlucky diners whose starter arrived about 10 minutes after the first arrivals .
Second course for me was cod with mussels . The mussels were good but the cod was over cooked , dry and disappointing.
Others had steak which they did say was very good , however again about 6 diners food arrived about 15 minutes after my food arrived . It’s embarrassing to eat your food with the person next you not having there’s .
The manager (I guess ) came up and apologised and offered some free meals but certainly put me off going again . There were only 25 of us and downstairs wasn’t busy so a bit surprised how this all happened .

As a foot note I’ve been a few times before and generally the experience has been great , but after this I will certainly check reviews before I go again .",January 2019,Kensington Arms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186220-d733160-Reviews-Kensington_Arms-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Great range of fish and big portions,"Lots of different fish on offer outside the typical
Cod and haddock including hake and probably my favourite lemon sole ( always 3 big pieces)
If you like extras try the deep friend scallops and a must is the side of tartar sauce - home made of course.

There is also a separate eat in area with a bar and the fish and chips is served in the same box’s but with a table service.

Improved considerably,"This restaurant has been redesigned in the last 12 months or so. The styling allows for cosy private meals in booths or if you prefer open areas with views of the harbour.
Staff were friendly and very helpful.
The food as well as the obvious from the name is typically very good pub food . Examples include steak, well spiced fish curries and typical dishes like lamb shank .

Always good but getting better,"We’ve been twice in the last month and had a lovely meal both times. The winter 2 dish’s for £20 is excellent value .
I’d recommend the venison cannelloni and partridge with blackberry as starters . The turbot , Goan fish curry and rump of lamb are great main courses.

There is now a new outside area , staff are helpful and friendly.

Great value",December 2018,The Basement,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315948-d1515356-Reviews-The_Basement-Padstow_Cornwall_England.html,"Padstow, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Don’t forget the chips,"We hadn’t booked but managed to find a table on a Thursday night .
Food was excellent and I would recommend the burger with goats cheese and the short rib . The beef is only part of the rib and slow cooked on the bone .its not huge but with chips filling and only £9.50 and most importantly melt in the mouth .
It also comes with two side sauces which are fab
Finally not sure what they do with the chips but they are also fab . They taste like the best chip shop chips with a spicy coating and not dripping with fat .

Service was quick and efficient and there is a decent but not extensive range of wine and cocktails/ spirits .

All prices very sensible , worth a visit , don’t miss it it’s one of the upstairs cargo restaurants.",September 2018,Harbour & Browns,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186220-d12641952-Reviews-Harbour_Browns-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good quality takeaway,"The food is prepared out of a parked van but don’t be put off by that .

There is a limited menu but both dishes we had were excellent . A speciality duck curry was lovely ( my favourite) and a Thai green chicken curry also excellent with a good heat kick .

The staff clearly make there own Thai curry paste and it comes through strongly in the quality of the dishes

The dishes are freshly prepared so either ring in or head to the nearby pub for a quick drink.",September 2018,Pom's Thai Takeaway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g488312-d12580941-Reviews-Pom_s_Thai_Takeaway-St_Mary_s_Isles_of_Scilly_England.html,"St Mary's, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great view great food,"This restaurant is both perfect for a lunch snack or cream tea to soak in the fantastic view .
We however went back for dinner and needed to book to get in . We sat outside with our dog although they do have an inside area for dogs .
Food for me was a trio of fish ( monkfish, pollock and gurnard ) on a bed of a chickpea stew with beetroot and feta . The fish was perfect and large fillet portions and the Stew absolutely lovely .
My wife had a fab sea food chowder .

The taste of each dish was fab.

Just fab,"Sitting outside the pub with a pint of sharpes beer and a hot beef roll in the sun can’t be beaten .
The views are fantastic and it’s even a great spot to wait for the boat back to st marys.

Just great,"My favourite curry house in Bristol .

Staff are always helpful and friendly and food is very good particularly from the tandoor.

Friendly staff but over priced average food,"This restaurant is situated in a nice spot so if the weather is good it’s a great place to sit out and eat .

The staff are friendly and helpful.

There is a selection of starters about 17 euros each and a range of fish and meat main courses about 27e plus you probably have to add a veg side .

We had the slow cooked poached egg with asparagus (which was good) and the 4 different local Venetian fish as our starters . The fish starter was ok but no wow flavours . For example there was a nice piece of octopus but in a bland red coating .

Mains we tried were the local Venetian fish ( I was told similar to sea bass)with a caper sauce which didn’t really come through however the fish itself was well cooked and a nice flavour

My wife had monkfish on a bed of spinach, she thought this was good .

Overall a relatively expensive restaurant which gave you nice but not wow food for the price . I wouldn’t rush back .",May 2018,Ostaria Da Rioba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d1537846-Reviews-Ostaria_Da_Rioba-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,3.0,4.5
No shorts and pay the extra to go to the museum,"The Basilica is a must see when visiting Venice . Cues at 10am were only 5 minutes and it’s free entry .
The mosaics were fantastic but I’d really recommend paying the extra 5 e and visiting the museum upstairs .
Firstly it wasn’t very busy , you get a close up look at the mosaic ceilings from the viewing balcony and you get to also see the 2000 year old 4 st marks horses.How these were made so long ago is amazing .
Finally outside you get breathtaking views of the square and surrounding areas.
One warning no shorts or vests to respect the Basilica or you won’t get in",May 2018,Basilica di San Marco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d191226-Reviews-Basilica_di_San_Marco-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice wine bar but food only average,"We visited this little place for a drink and something to eat . Firstly it is now under new ownership since January .

It felt to me much more a place for Pre drinks rather than to eat . They have a good selection of wines and the staff were very helpful in recommending a few different choices , so all very good for a drink .

There were tapas which we tried and they were ok

The main dishes although very well priced at 8 euros each were again only ok .

My recommendation go and having booked somewhere else for dinner . It’s worth a visit , staff are friendly and a great choice of wines",May 2018,Cantina Aziende Agricole,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d1320395-Reviews-Cantina_Aziende_Agricole-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Worth the trip,"This Basilica is on one of the furthest islands from Venice . A simple suggestion visit this island first and make your way back to Burano and Mirano.

Overall Well worth a visit to the church and bell tower . Cost 12 euros including an entrance to a small separate museum.
The mosaics in the church were stunning but do get the free audio guide which was very informative of what you were seeing.
There was good information on the history and also an understanding of what the mosaics depicted

The bell tower gave you fab views of the whole area and wasn’t too difficult to access as it was primarily up a raised circular incline rather than lots of steps .

Overall I’m not a great “church’s/ historical “ sites person but this was worth a visit .",May 2018,Basilica di Santa Maria Assunta e Chiesa di Santa Fosca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1647571-d599719-Reviews-Basilica_di_Santa_Maria_Assunta_e_Chiesa_di_Santa_Fosca-Torcello_Veneto.html,"Torcello, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Not very interesting,"I visited this small museum as an add on to the Basilica and Bell tower . It probably was the least interesting and relatively small .

There were some interesting ancient pottery but not a lot else",May 2018,Museo Provinciale di Torcello,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1647571-d8120992-Reviews-Museo_Provinciale_di_Torcello-Torcello_Veneto.html,"Torcello, Italy",attractions,3.0,4.0
Simple pasta and pizza but good quality,"We walked up on a Tuesday night and managed to get a table . The place was pretty busy with tables close together .

Service was very quick . We had great spaghetti with meat balls , good pizza (nice and thin base) . Also house prosecco was good .

Including a beer as well price with tip 50 euros",May 2018,Ristorante Tintoretto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d6280706-Reviews-Ristorante_Tintoretto-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Rustic but fab,"Well don’t expect perfect service and white table cloths but if you want friendly waiters and fantastic steak platters this is the place .
The place is pretty busy and don’t expect to be able to book . We walked up and waited a few minutes while a table cleared . We had chateaubrienn see photo and it was as good as it looks . The steak is carved on a platter with “chips” peppers spinach ,mushrooms ,aubergine ,rocket ,dips and pineapple done on the grill.

Very good selection of wines we followed a recommendation from the waiter and had a lovely smooth red for 30 euros .

I’d recommend this as a great place for good food and wine with nice atmosphere as well.",May 2018,Al Timon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d1069463-Reviews-Al_Timon-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great value Sunday lunch,"First visit to this restaurant for Sunday lunch.

Good choice of roasts with turkey and beef recommended from what we had . Large portions and good quality cuts eg beef included rolled sirloin.

Lots of extras ( sausages , stuffing Yorkshire’s ) and at least 6 veg which you help yourself to . Good roasties as well .

Overall it was busy ( you can’t book) but it did quieten down after a 12 pm rush . It was a bit chaotic but in a nice way .

The place is dog friend ( ours loved it , especially because of the sneaked slice of meat from the lady on the next table as we left )

there was also lots of families with kids.

Staff all helpful , friendly and smiling - really nice to see when they were busy .

Only suggestion try and not sit in the extension area as it got pretty hot in the direct sun .

Well worth a visit , good value at £10.95 , we will be back",April 2018,Margot's Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315948-d12645494-Reviews-Margot_s_Restaurant-Padstow_Cornwall_England.html,"Padstow, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Well worth a visit,"I was staying over in Nottingham and a friend and I visited this restaurant following a recommendation
The restaurant was busy when we arrived so perhaps book if others visit . It’s next to two other Indians , all looked busy .

I had a very good Goan fish curry with rice and Nan .
The curry was spicy with lovely firm fish , couldnt recommend more .
I also thought the Nan was exceptional.

Staff were friendly , efficient and looked after us well
the food also arrived quickly

All round a very good curry house",April 2018,4550 miles from Delhi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186356-d2062401-Reviews-4550_miles_from_Delhi-Nottingham_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good value hotel near Mont Blanc tunnel,"This is a great hotel if you are looking for good value accommodation with friendly service .it is better than the 3 star rating but clearly not in the expensive 5 star of some others.

The hotel is at the top of Courmayeur about 2 miles from the centre . So prices are cheaper but the rooms are good , comfortable with firm beds , well maintained Room. Shower I had was fine but little small.

Very good breakfast but no evening meals.

The owner does shuttle service pretty much on demand to and from theski lifts.

He also does one free trip to the centre in the evening

We found two good restaurants within 10 minutes walk

Only thing to watch is make sure you have phone number of a taxi or know the times of buses later in the evening . The last one from the centre is 1145 (sharpe) .

I’d recommend for good value 3 star plus accommodation. its only 1 hour 25 mins ish from Geneva airport so ideal for a long weekend ski trip.",March 2018,Hotel La Vallee Blanche,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187865-d1738028-Reviews-Hotel_La_Vallee_Blanche-Courmayeur_Valle_d_Aosta.html,"Courmayeur, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.5
Fantastic food with a little but,"The food in this restaurant was the best we had from four restaurants we tried in Courmayeur. Overall the staff were very attentive , especially the reception staff as we came and left coats and were shown to the restaurant . Not very often I applaud a coat taker !!

The food was also top quality .

I had a fantastic grilled goats cheese starter with Parma ham with a crusty base and a pomegranate drizzle .other choices included a very good asparagus risotto and a large antipasto meat starter .
Mains included a fantastic venison sirloin with a fab juniper jus. The venison was beautifully cooked and exceptional tender .

There was a different pumpkin risotto ( to share ) with Blue cheese which friends also raved about .

There was an extensive wine list and what looked a great cheese board.

Overall fabulous food , service was little mixed eg wrong order on a risotto and staff at times very attentive and then busy doing other things

Overall however a must just for the food and based on reception and hotel staff with a lovely bar area and log fire I would also bet a good hotel to stay at .",March 2018,Auberge De La Maison Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187865-d5984791-Reviews-Auberge_De_La_Maison_Restaurant-Courmayeur_Valle_d_Aosta.html,"Courmayeur, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Truly great !!,"The restaurant is in the new cargo area by M Shed and we had a late Sunday lunch and just turned up without booking .

Very good Caribbean food , jerk chicken (3 pieces ) were spiced but not too hot and very good . Goat curry was again lovely , cooked on the bone so watch them but a big portion and also nicely spiced .

We also had chicken wings with fries and slaw and to start a plate of hummus between 3 which was a perfect starter.

Very nice atmosphere with a range of people at lunch time from mums and dads with young kids to couples and friends just out for lunch

I had a mojito which was £7 and great there was various drinks , not a great choice of wine and beer but enough.

The three of us all enjoyed the food and we found the staff friendly with a quick service

I looked up the restaurant to write this review and was very surprised by a few of the recent poor one star reviews. Glad I hadn’t seen them before we went or might not of gone . Ignore them we will be back

Overall price before a tip £51 for three people so good value as well.",February 2018,Calypso Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186220-d12275062-Reviews-Calypso_Kitchen-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Very good simple Greek food,"We got a warm welcome from the the hosts when we arrived and quickly seated in surprisingly busy/ full restaurant. Granted it was a Saturday night but they had been only open 10days .

So if you are planning a visit BOOK

The menu wasn’t huge , but had the typically starters ( taramoslata ,hummus, king prawns, squid) . I’d recommend the Greek “brusheta “.

Main courses had a number of pasta based dishes also pork and chicken souvlaki and slow cooked lamb .

I had the mixed grill with lovely marinated pork , chicken and a lamb chop served with a simple salad and home made chips .

The food was simple but beautifully cooked and for a busy restaurant very quickly served.

There was a choice of wine by the glass and wines from different countries.

Staff were friendly and attentive , some obviously just learning, but you’d expect this with a new restaurant.

Overall very good addition to locally restaurants which I’m sure will be regularly busy . We will be back",February 2018,Athena Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186220-d13392736-Reviews-Athena_Restaurant-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great Sunday roast,"Six of us had a Sunday roast . Choice of beef pork or lamb.

We shared a calamari and deep fried prawns ( only £4.50 a portion) as a starter and both were very very good

The roasts came with lots of meat and veg ( cabbage , carrots , cauliflower , red cabbage roasties ) and a huge Yorkshire pudding 13.95 each. All again very good .

Food came really quickly , staff were nice and friendly .

We didn’t book but did get there early

Excellent and good value for money,"This hotel is very close to gard du nord and hence great place to stay if travelling on Eurostar.
The staff were very helpful e.g. One of our group left early and left his glasses which another person was able to find and return.
The rooms were very comfortable , excellent beds, good air conditioning and bathroom was spotless with great shower.
We booked early and at a good comparable price",October 2017,Ibis Paris Gare du Nord Chateau Landon 10th Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d197650-Reviews-Ibis_Paris_Gare_du_Nord_Chateau_Landon_10th_Hotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,4.0,3.5
Great little bistro close to gard du nord,"We visited this bistro after Just arriving on the Eurostar.

It is a very small bistro ,probably less than 40 covers. Staff were friendly and the food excellent.

I had a fabulous fish dish with a crab soup base, beans with cod and squid . It may not sound fantastic but the taste with tender squid and cod was fantastic.
For sweet asimple chocolate mousse was just perfect to finish

We visited 3 different restaurants over are weekend for ""the Arc"" and this was the best.

Wine selection was good if a little expensive

If you are not on a budget visit this little bistro but book in advance .",September 2017,Les Arlots,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d10072596-Reviews-Les_Arlots-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
worth a visit for the Foie Gras alone,"This is a good French Bistro not far from Gard Do Nord. Ten of us had dinner over ""the Arc "" weekend and the restaurant was very busy with both English and French customers. The service was good considering how busy it was .
I had the best Seared Foie Gras I've had in any restaurant so look out for that on the Menu.
A steak for main course was good but not Excellent , nice sauce , creamy mash but not melt in the mouth steak.

Overall a good atmosphere a good range of wines as well but worth a trip for my ""best starter ever""",October 2017,L'Ardoise Gourmande,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d1392650-Reviews-L_Ardoise_Gourmande-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Limited for a mid week lunch,"Our first visit to this pub and I would like to come back for dinner as the food we had was good .

However the menu didn't have much choice for a quick and simple mid week lunch e.g. A Simple ploughmans or a good quality sandwich . Yes they did have 4-5 main courses which sounded great but £17-£19 course was not what I wanted .

I ended up having a starter of Cornish fish stew which was very good and my wife had arancini . Both were really excellent but not substantial enough on their own. We added The three times cooked chips at £3.50. however they were pretty average and over priced.

The beer I had was well kept, we also had a lime and soda which meant the total bill came to over £20.

Perhaps the lack of choice at lunch time and the prices explained why there was no one else in the pub inside or out on a lovely lunch time in August so the atmosphere was ""quiet""

Any chance of a catch on the gate onto the sitting out area if people bring a dog after the morning walk ( like we did) or have kids. It would avoid anyone worrying about them running on the adjacent road .

Overall the food we had was good and with main courses at just under £20 each I'm sure it's a great place for dinner but not for me personally at lunch .

how about a ""lunch time only specials choice""

We will be back for dinner but without the dog !!",August 2017,Bird In Hand,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g7976817-d2478637-Reviews-Bird_In_Hand-Long_Ashton_Somerset_England.html,"Long Ashton, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Fantastic beach snack bar,"Four of us visited this lovely restaurant on the rocks near peniche. It's difficult to find but a must if you want simple but fab fresh sea food at unbelievable prices

Firstly the inside is a bit basic but it has been upgraded since we first visited five years or so ago. So new walls and tiled floors but still plastic table clothes with paper tops .

the food is far from basic , we had sardines (6 large grilled fish and very fresh) with a fab large salad and home made chips 9e .

There was also large garlic prawns ( sold by the kilo) we had a 1/3 kilo (about 12 big prawns) enough for 2 of us.

The best dish however was fresh garlic clams which we had with lovely fresh bread .

We also had beer served in metal jugs( clearly kept in the freezer) which kept the beer lovely and cold 2e each

We saw lots of locals having special dishes like prawns with rice and what looked great a meat hot stew with lots of vegetables

Also fresh fish and steaks on the menu for around 10-12 e

Overall lunch for 4 with beers 45e

Great value

Also I'd say it worth a visit not just for the food but the great views of the waves hitting the rocks",June 2017,Snack Bar Sol é Vida,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608952-d10838943-Reviews-Snack_Bar_Sol_e_Vida-Peniche_Leiria_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Peniche, Portugal",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good location and better than the photos on booking sites,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights , we were upgraded to a larger room .
The bedroom was large with a king size bed and very comfortable .
We were slightly put off by booking sites photos as we'd been booked in with a travel company . However the hotel was significantly better than we expected .

Good points

Helpful staff
Good room with comfortable bed
Good bath and shower
Very good location for
Supermarket
Local cafe for a coffe/ lunch or Starbucks
Easy access tocentral attractions like hermitage
Underground very close
Generally a quiet/ not noisy hotel

Improvements
Breakfast was only ok, poor choice of hot food
Hotel although big was very busy at breakfast unless you eat late

Points to note
There are a few restaurants recommended on the main road to the hermitage

However there is a road that runs parallel with the hotel street which has a great/far better selection of bars and restaurants. The Ones we tried where good value with nice atmospheres",April 2017,Dostoevsky Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298507-d300320-Reviews-Dostoevsky_Hotel-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",hotels,4.0,3.0
Worth a quick visit,"The church has a fabulous selection of mosaic pictures and is a major historic site.

Personally I thought it was interesting to see but not outstanding and depending on time the hermitage and summer palaces are must do's if your time is limited .

Cost is 250 rubles to go inside",April 2017,Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298507-d300133-Reviews-Church_of_the_Savior_on_Spilled_Blood-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",attractions,4.0,5.0
Great food,"We had a late lunch in this bar/restaurant . Firstly it had a nice feel with comfortable sofas/chairs and couples sat around either eating or just having a drink . All the menu is in English and sensibly priced .

Spectacular but very busy,"Firstly the palace opens at 10am but only for groups until 12am .
Our guide said it gets very busy , we had to wait 30 mins to get in
You can't take ruck sacks or coats on the tour which are left at the entrance . So no water for the tour.
When we were walking around there were very enthusiastic and big groups especially Chinese . When You are in important/ busy rooms such as the amber room you are kept moving by the staff
In the amber room only there are no photos If you try to take one you are taken out immediately

There are loads of spectacular rooms with huge amounts of gold . The view through the main corridor from one end of the palace to the other is amazing

Obviously with the palace being rebuilt it does give a great feel of what the palace was like when built .

The grounds are also worth walking around and try and visit the private residence that was used when not formally entertaining at the palace .

One recommendation in summer if you are not in a group you can wait for hours for a ticket with no guarantee of getting in so a pre booked tour maybe a good idea

The palace was the best place we visited in our Russia stay

Cafe is also good for drinks/food",April 2017,Catherine Palace and Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g811323-d301025-Reviews-Catherine_Palace_and_Park-Pushkin_Pushkinsky_District_St_Petersburg_Northwestern_D.html,"Pushkin, Russia",attractions,5.0,4.5
