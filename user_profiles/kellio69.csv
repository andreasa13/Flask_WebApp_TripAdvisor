BEWARE ..,"I booked Hughes on 3 occasions through booking.com requesting a 0-6month child car restraint, without issue. The total cost was stated each time and paid directly to booking.com.
The first 2 occasions were great, the driver was punctual, friendly and very helpful with our suitcases and baby stuff.
3 days prior to the third pick up, we received a text message stating an extra charge for baby seat hire was required before they would confirm the transfer. On calling Hughes they demanded $44 for the next transfer and return trip, when asked why this extra cost was not clearly stated on booking the service and why on the previous 2 occasions was this ""extra"" charge not requested. Basically the woman on the phone said the driver was expected to collect it ...again this was never stated, she wanted to know if I was paying the extra fee NOW over the phone, otherwise the transfer would not go ahead.Not wanting to be stranded at the airport with a 4month old baby, I reluctantly paid.
I contacted booking.com to make a complaint about the hidden costs not being clearly stated, they in turn told me these types of hidden costs from suppliers is absorbed by booking.com and I should not have been contacted directly or been forced to pay the hire fee for the car seat, they promptly refunded me the extra charge.

Paradise Lost!!!,"We travelled as a group of 4, having heard good things about Mango Bay Resort. The resort was quite with very few guests, but the surroundings were absolutely beautiful. The staff were friendly, welcoming and efficient given that their workplace is an atmosphere of fear, racism and public verbal abuse from the owner Bill Duffy. The price of food and drinks was high with big increases since we originally booked our stay, the food was ok but somewhat limited. The organised non-inclusive activities were many, but because of minimum number requirements very few actually took place, meaning we missed out on doing things we were interested in doing.",November 2016,Mango Bay Resort Fiji,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294336-d585006-Reviews-Mango_Bay_Resort_Fiji-Sigatoka_Coral_Coast_Viti_Levu.html,"Viti Levu, Fiji",hotels,2.0,4.0
