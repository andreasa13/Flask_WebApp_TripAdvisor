Leisurely lunch at Longleat!,"On Saturday, our eldest son and his wife held their 30th birthday party at Longleat. The day was a spectacular success, which was mainly due to the setting, food, staff and wines at the estate. Guido, Sandra and their staff were incredibly welcoming and interested that we had everything we needed. The food was superb and the wines were excellent. Fabulous party destination. There was plenty of room for the children to wander amongst the vines, and Pedro the dog was a fabulous addition.",December 2019,Longleat Estate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g11955560-d3140829-Reviews-Longleat_Estate-Murchison_Greater_Shepparton_Victoria.html,"Murchison, Australia",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Leisurely, luscious lunch.","We stumbled onto 'Heaven' looking for a lunch spot close to our hotel, Mercure Excelsior. The owners could not have been more accommodating. I think we were there during Siesta, and we'd already read signs at our hotel about power outagages. The young man at the front of house could not have been more helpful or accommodating. As we were a group of 9, and some of us were larger than average, he seriously went out of his way to re-arrange the furniture in one salon to accommodate us all very comfortably. He was obviously distressed when the power went out, and took many measures to ensure we were cool and comfortable. The serves of food were very generous (next time, we'll share!!!), the range of food was great, the drinks were reasonably priced, and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience.",October 2019,"Cucina Casalinga ""da Mimmo""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187888-d10824794-Reviews-Cucina_Casalinga_da_Mimmo-Catania_Province_of_Catania_Sicily.html,"Sicily, Italy",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Very close to all the action!,"We never worry about the age of an Hotel, and believe that the older hotels often have the bigger rooms and en suites. The Excelsior is no exception! The hotel is huge, and depending on the location of your room, you can add 200 steps to your daily count just going from the elevator to your door!!! The hotel was spotlessly clean, had great facilities, and, like almost every hotel we've stayed in in Italy, the domestic staff were fantastic! They were friendly, helpful, and had great senses of humour. This was particularly evident on the morning neither of our keycards would work. The gorgeous made came up, tried our two cards, and then sort of waved hers in front of us, as though it was magic. Nothing happened, and the three of us fell about laughing! She quickly phoned for help, and within minutes we were back in our room!!! We were particularly impressed by the pride in which the wait staff in the various eating areas took wit their work. Everything from bread to crockery and cutlery through to food serving areas was immaculate. It was an absolute pleasure to eat there. The central location of the hotel was also great. There were many, many restaurants within an easy walking distance, and the prices fitted all budgets. My only criticism (and it's the same criticism I've had for most of the hotels we've stayed in in Italy this time) was of the Reception Staff. Their arrogance and rudeness had to be seen to be believed. At the end of our stay, I queued behind one of our group to tell the Reception staff how wonderful the domestic staff had been. As the receptionist chose to deal with four other guests, I walked away.",October 2019,Mercure Catania Excelsior,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187888-d233482-Reviews-Mercure_Catania_Excelsior-Catania_Province_of_Catania_Sicily.html,"Sicily, Italy",hotels,4.0,3.5
Stunning Spritzers!,"After a long, hot walk through a very busy Positano, we were lucky enough to find this delightful little café. The staff were very helpful, caring and polite. Nothing was too much trouble for them, and they were always cheery. The spritzers were to die for! They were very cold and delicious -- just what we needed!",September 2019,Elisir di Positano Cafè&Salads,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g194863-d6899367-Reviews-Elisir_di_Positano_Cafe_Salads-Positano_Amalfi_Coast_Province_of_Salerno_Campania.html,"Positano, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Vista of Vesuvius,"Our stay in this hotel was really lovely. The location was spectacular, and the skills of the shuttle bus driver had to be seen to be believed! The domestic staff were just excellent with their service, attention to detail and senses of humour. However, the male reception staff were rude, sexist and arrogant. The breakfasts were superb, the views from the balcony were mind blowing, and the food was excellent. The regular shuttle bus was a huge bonus. Each trip saved us A$38 per trip in taxi fares. The management and the drivers were also incredibly generous in taking small groups to the pick up points for other tours, and also picking us up at the same points. Make the effort to sit on the balcony for the sunset!",September 2019,Art Hotel Gran Paradiso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187782-d277288-Reviews-Art_Hotel_Gran_Paradiso-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Sorrento, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0

Luxury at a budget friendly price.,"To say that the views from the front of this hotel are exceptional is an absolute understatement! Regardless of the weather, there is always something brilliant to observe from one vantage point or another. The hotel is spotless, the artworks are quirky, and the regular shuttle bus to and from the station is amazing! Add the regularity of the service, to the drivers’ sheer skill, and the €25 saving in cab fares is exceptional value. The sunsetsviewed from the pool deck are simply stunning, and easy to photograph from the patio above the pool deck area.The only downside for my female friends and me was the arrogant, disdainful attitudes we received from one of the male receptionists, and several of the male waiters. As women, we are more than capable of handing our keys into reception when leaving the hotel. Similarly, women can enjoy an espresso coffee just as much as a man can. Women do not need to be ignored at the front desk, in favour of a male occupant of the hotel. Similarly, women are quite capable of ordering, and drinking, an espresso without the eye-rolling from a waiter. Gentlemen, good manners cost nothing.",September 2019,Hotel La Badia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187782-d559636-Reviews-Hotel_La_Badia-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Sorrento, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.5

There were plenty of dining options within a short walking distance, as well as a supermarket and pharmacies.

Authentic Greek food and traditional hospitality!,"We loved this little restaurant for a number of reasons. Firstly, the owners were just fabulous! They were very friendly, remembered us, and spoilt us with little treats. Secondly, the food was fantastic. It was fresh and delicious. You can tell the food is fresh when you can hear the salad being chopped up, and your fish sizzling! The prices were more than reasonable, and the servings were big enough for us to share dishes. Thirdly, the cafe was about fifty steps from our hotel. Consequently, we ate lunches and dinners there. Although the decor was not luxurious, it met all our requirements and was spotless.

A Little Slice of Heaven at Hermes,"The Hermes Hotel was just a delightful place in which to stay! With only 45 rooms, the staff very quickly learned our names and room numbers. All staff were incredibly helpful, polite and friendly. Their advice was accurate and supportive, and the reception staff all spoke a number of languages fluently. The rooms were spotless, a good size, and the ensuite was very good. Additionally, the breakfast was great! The location was superb, being in the older part of Athens. It was literally a walk from the Acropolis and Parthenon, the Ancient Agora, Orthodox Churches, the Cathedral, Hadrian's Arch and Library, etc., etc., etc. It was also slap bang in the middle of fantastic cafes, restaurants and shops -- from little souvenir shops, to upmarket designers. The rooftop terrace was a wonderful surprise,and you could improve on your view with a visit to the terrace on the sister hotel, Hotel Plaka.

Priceless views!,"We had two dinners at this delightful restaurant, and recommend you try it for yourself! The climb to the terrace may be slightly difficult if you have health problems, but the views will soon make you forget the effort! We dined at sunset, and were able to not only watch the sun set, we were able to watch the city lights come on, and watch planes line up to land at Ataturk Airport.

A Step Back in Time.,"We recently spent three nights at the Dara Hotel. The location of this quaint, little, family owned hotel was just excellent! We travelled with a friend who has health problems, and even he was able to walk to Ayasofya, Topkapi, Basilica Cistern, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar and Orient Express Railway Station. The hotel was also just a short distance from the tram line. The proximity to various mosques also allowed us to experience the 'Calls to Prayer'--perhaps not a bonus for light sleepers. The traffic noise on the cobblestones may also be annoying to some.The breakfast was delicious, and dining on the terrace overlooking the sea and the line up of ships of all sizes was incredible!

The rooms are gorgeous, and the bathrooms are great. The breakfasts are good, and two restaurants in the hotel are quite good. However, if you want a room with a view, ensure you avoid rooms 09-12 on each floor. And, a real bonus is that you can drink the tap water -- very handy in 41 degree heat!

However, the friendly staff quickly pointed out that the 'Reserved' signs on some tables were to ensure larger groups could easily find a seat. We were also pleasantly surprised by the playground, and the extensive, heated outdoor area. The menu was wide-ranging, the coffee was excellent and the food was delicious.

The staff are also incredibly patient with young children being encouraged to use them manners when ordering their food. The range of breakfast meals is extensive, and the serves are generous.

A hidden treasure,"This is a great, quit little place to stay. I am impressed by the commitment to the environment. This hotel only replaces you towels when you leave them on the floor, there is no endless supply of shower caps, shoe polishing gear, soap, shampoo, conditioner, combs etc. Liquid soap and shampoo are in good sized dispensers on the wall of the shower. The hotel is only 10-15 minute walk to the beach, Seminyak Square and and a number of wonderful restaurants such as Ku De Ta and Potato Head Beach Club, and you experience the sights, sounds and smells of Seminyak on the way. There are also tiny little shops about 75m away where you can buy 1.5L of water for .50c.Three shuttle services run every day, but cab fares are a pittance. The food at breakfast is good, but the lunch and dinner menus are not only varied, the food is beautiful and the prices are
more than reasonable. The pool is really lovely, and various flotation devices are available for adults and children. The major highlight is the staff, for whom nothing is too much bother.
