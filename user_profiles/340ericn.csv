Very good restaurant with amazing staff and unique location,"We stayed in Anidri for 4 nights with our 2 teens. Was amazing to walk in the mountains to reach the village and to go to this surprising restaurant. Unique location, amazing view of the Anidri gorge and the sea from the terrace, lovely staff and VERY good home cooked Cretan food. Lot of choices on the menu with several new meals every day! We went 3 nights! Good memories. If you are in the area, worth the few km drive from Paleochora to eat in this former Anidri schoolhouse closed in the 70’s. Highly recommended.",July 2018,Kafeneio sto Scholeio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6868797-d2456515-Reviews-Kafeneio_sto_Scholeio-Anidri_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great food, great location, great staff, great restaurant!","Beautiful restaurant with an amazing view, excellent food (a little more sophistication than other restaurants in the area) and professional staff who perfectly addressed my food allergies. Highly recommended.",July 2018,Castro Restaurant & Cafe Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g644209-d10826634-Reviews-Castro_Restaurant_Cafe_Bar-Palaiochora_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Best place in the area for fresh fish,"We went there for dinner with our 2 teens. Very good fishes, we loved the tuna and swordfish steaks, perfectly cooked. A must to go if you like fresh fish. A mix of tourists and locals. Good atmosphere.",July 2018,Limani Fish Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1028265-d4695173-Reviews-Limani_Fish_Tavern-Kissamos_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Disappointed. The setting is great but the food did not fit with our expectations.,"We decided to go to this family restaurant just outside Kissamos with our 2 teens after reading the recommendations on TripAdvisor. First, we arrived at 9 PM and we were alone on the terrace, which was strange and unusual in the area and for the time of the year. The waitress was very warm and friendly. However, many items on the menu were not available, wine of this bad quality should not be served in restaurants and the food was tasteless. The four of us did not enjoy the dinner. We don’t understand the high recommendations on TripAdvisor.",July 2018,Erofili,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g12963325-d12844096-Reviews-Erofili-Neo_Chorio_Kissamos_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Surprisingly amazing,"We went to this restaurant 2 times with our 2 teens. When we arrived the first time, we were surprised how big it is and we were afraid that is a tourist trap. And, no it is not. Yes, there are a lot of tourists but the atmosphere is great, the staff warm and friendly and the food is very tasty and good. The free raki at arrival and fruits bar at the end were very appreciated. We highly recommend it.",July 2018,Grambousa Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1509156-d1509909-Reviews-Grambousa_Restaurant-Kaliviani_Kissamos_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Quick very good lunch after Samaria,We went to this restaurant with our two teens. The food was very good and the staff friendly and professional. They addressed perfectly my food allergies.

Good restaurant for a lunch,"We stopped by with our 2 teens for a quick lunch during a 1-day Chania visit. The fresh calmars and octopus were amazing, the salads were good and the white wine was perfectly refreshing. Highly recommended.",July 2018,To Maridaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d6407891-Reviews-To_Maridaki-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A must to do,The Samaria Gorge is a must to do in Crete. Beautiful scenery. Not so difficult. We were with our two teens and we all loved it. We took a taxi from Paleochora (65 euros for 4 people; about 1h15 ride) to be at the opening of the Park before the crowd. We booked the taxi the day before at the taxi agency in Paleochora. We were nearly alone all the time and reached Agia Roumeli before the crowd. Amazing. We avoided the heat in the trail and were before the crowd to get lunch in Agia Roumeli and to select a place at the beach. We went back to Paleochora with the ferry. We highly recommend it and to start early.,July 2018,Samaria Gorge National Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2396903-d254264-Reviews-Samaria_Gorge_National_Park-Sfakia_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful,"Yes there are a lot of people. Yes it is touristic but it worths it. Go as far as you can to avoid the crowd (not very long, 10 minutes walk in the direction of the island and you are alone). Nice snorkeling in the rocks.",July 2018,Elafonissi Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1535800-d1536672-Reviews-Elafonissi_Beach-Elafonissi_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
A gem for breakfast,"Nice and cosy little restaurant/café located in a quiet street. Original decoration. Smiley staff. Good food. The portions are quite big, so do not hesitate to share your plates!
