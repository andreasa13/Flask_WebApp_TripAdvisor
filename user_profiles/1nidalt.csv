Excellent Pakistan Buffet,Came here with 8 adults and 8 kids and had an amazing lunch buffet. The quantity and quality of food options is daunting to digest. Best thing is the value of money considering the amount we paid (AED 700 which includes the tip) for 16 people.

Reasonable price / facilities and good staff,My family and I spent 2 nights here during the weekend. The price is a good deal for a location near many attractions.
