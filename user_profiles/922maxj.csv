Recommended,The Panathenaic Stadium was absolutely breathtaking. For only €5 per person I would definitely recommend going here. You get a free audio guide which is very detailed and explains a lot of the history. Also very nice to see lots of the olympic torches. If you feel up to it I would also recommend going to the very top of the stadium and walk around the upper echelon for amazing views of Athens.,October 2019,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Absolutely stunning,"I would recommend this to anyone visiting Athens or visiting near and around it. You can get in for just €20 or pay €30 for a multi site pass which let's you into 6 other places as well as the Acropolis itself which I would strongly recommend as it saves you money and it gives you an idea on other things to do.

On the topic of the Acropolis though it is a must visit. A short walk up to the top of the hill will show you many sights including the Theater of Dionysus. Once at the top there are many other sights apart from the Acropolis such as the Temple of Athena Nike. It also provides beautiful views of the city and the countryside around it.

I would recommend getting here early however or booking your tickets online via the official site to save both time and money as queues can easily take up to an hour. Another way to save time is to visit one of the less popular sights on the pass, buy the pass there for the same price then skip the queues later when you get to the Acropolis.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
