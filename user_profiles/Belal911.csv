Poor and very old,"I just want to mention in the beginning that I like this airline in general and I used it many times but I’m reviewing my last trip which was very poor.
The flight TK0152 was really bad for the following:
This flight can’t be used for international especially for big company and not cheap.
It’s very old and small flight. Very old screen tv that has nothing. The screen always on and bothering that can’t sleep. The screen has no entertainment only to bother.
The previous flight from Athens to Istanbul which about only one hour and half was much better.
Second, the crew was not professional, they just like to bother and it seems they mean it. Whenever they see you sleep they wake you up for no reason. I didn’t touch my seat once I sit on it but the air hostess kept coming to me to sit it up which really annoying. When serving food, I got water on me like she didn’t care.

Super unorganized,"We had ferry with (NISSOS MYKONOS) from Athens to Mykonos
There was no clear guidance when boarding the ferry. People in the economy can do whatever they want since there was no asinged seats.
There were 2 guys who were reserving 6 seats. 2 for them, 2 in front of them reserved them by putting coats , and 2 next to them so they had a very larg space for them with no supervision.

Clean issue,"We had two pizza with my friend. The restaurant was big and empty. We were watching the chif while cooking. However, one of the workers was helping wit dirty hands and no cloves
The pizza was good",November 2018,Bocca Buona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298547-d14953290-Reviews-Bocca_Buona-Dammam_Eastern_Province.html,"Dammam, Saudi Arabia",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Was good but second visit was disappointing,"I have visited this restaurant twice. First time I tried it was excellent when I ordered (Mansaf)
Today I ordered steak sandwich was not good as the bread was bad and hard to bite
Plus the ketchup was EXPIRED with dark color
I don’t know how they serve expired food was an expensive restaurant.
The prices not cheap but food wasn’t ok
This time was disappointing and last visit",November 2018,Quick Bites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298545-d2396716-Reviews-Quick_Bites-Al_Khobar_Eastern_Province.html,"Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Very nice salad bar,"I know it’s a steak house and more specialized with steak, but the salad bar is excellent. I go there from time to time for their salad and soup offer. It’s very nice.

Great attraction in Abu Dhabi,"I’ve been in the louvre in Paris before and this time in Abu Dhabi. I really like this one and I feel like anyone who visits Abu Dhabi should visit this nice museum. There’s descriptions on everything in Arabic and English. It was big and worth visiting.
There’s also WiFi in case you need to use it

Good airline and good timing,"Turkish airline is good, the prices are acceptable and has good timing regarding waiting time in Istanbul. However, on my last trip to Lyon I really didn’t like the meals they provided.
Another issue sometimes we face In Istanbul airport to change the flight. It needs more organized",May 2018,Turkish Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729174-Reviews-Turkish-Airlines,World,flights,4.0,4.0
For Dubai is good,"First I’ll talk in general about Saudi airlines.
Almost all flights from Dammam has to stop in Jeddah or Riyadh like Dammam is not a major city while Dammam is a major city and we should have direct flights to most of distinctions without stopping in Jeddah or Riyadh.
The second issue is the rate of the tickets
For example if I’m planning to go to Europe I’ll choose different airlines because I’ll find less time and much cheaper rates.
For my trip from Dammam to Dubai was good but I didn’t like the meals the provided. They used to be better but I think they changed.
In general for this trip was good and had no problem",September 2018,Saudia Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729144-Reviews-Saudia-Airlines,World,flights,3.0,3.5
Good as value but issue with timing,"I tried KLM many times. It has some advantages as value of money, nice air hostesses, food is ok but can be better. Seats are ok.
The main issue and thing I really don’t like and many times I use different airlines is timing.
Most or maybe all flights that coming back from Europe back to home leaves super early. For example my last trip to Barcelona the flight departure was 6am. Why is that early???
That means I have to leave the hotel and checkout before 4am which before the buses and breakfast. Plus, it means I can’t even enjoy my last night cuz I have a super early flight at 6am. I think there’s another flight after 6 but the price is so high more than half of my whole ticket which is not reasonable.
I want to mention another issue I faced from Barcelona back home. I had my carry on bag which not really big. I took it with my from home to Barcelona with no problem but when I’m coming back they told me it’s too big and I can’t take it with me. The problem when I went inside the plane I saw many passengers who have their bag which really bigger than mine. How they allowed them but for my small bag they said it’s too big??!!!",September 2018,KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729104-Reviews-KLM-Royal-Dutch-Airlines,World,flights,3.0,4.0
"Good restaurant, nice staff","We came here with a group of friends. The food was good and staff were nice. The restaurant is big and clean. We started with some burgers and and chilli cheese and jalapeño and wings. They were very chilli for me.
Then we tried 3 types of ribs. Flavour X was the best then old skool BBQ was good too. However, I didn’t like peri peri that much.
Last thing was sweet (waffle with ice cream) was good.
