Amazing architecture and history,We enjoyed our experience on the Acropolis. We hired a private guide who did a wonderful job explaining the history of the place. Without the guide our experience wouldn't have been as rich. We paid about 200 euros for a half day private tour for 2 of us. On the face kind of expensive but we felt it a good value.,September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful for an evening stroll,We stayed in Plaka and were only a short distance from the main tourist street. It was full of tourists but also full of shops and restaurants.

This is a large site worth a few hours of exploring,We spent a few hours walking around the site. It is a large site and many ruins to see. It was a rainy day when we went and was not hot.

For 30 euros we got a 5 day pass for several of the sites.

Convenient way to get around Amsterdam,"We arrived in Amsterdam via the airport then took a train to a train station near where we were staying.

This allowed us to get on and off any tram for 1 hour. Once on the tram we realized you can purchase tickets on the tram from a person. The next time we got on the tram we purchased 48 hour passes which allowed us to ride the tram whenever we wanted for 2 days, For 2 of us if was about 25 euros.

Fun and fast paced chocolate purchasing!!!,I had found an article listing the 5 best chocolate shops in Brussels. With so many to choose from I'm not sure how they decided but we were on a quest to go to all of them. That led us to Passion chocolate. A small shop off the beaten track. The young lady who waited on us was very helpful. She explained how the different mixed chocolate boxes were priced and how many pieces you'd get. Then she helped us choose our chocolate. Instead of letting us ponder over our choices she asked us if we liked something or not and if we said yes...in the box that one would go.

Mine was covered in whipped cream and strawberries and my wife's with cherries and nuts. Delicious! The wait staff was prompt and friendly. In fact, we were walking by the shop later in the evening when they were closing and he saw us, smiled and said hello. Again, there are lots of waffles places to choose from but this is a winner.

It was fun to learn the history of Amsterdam and see the architecture from a different perspective. It was a bit confusing going from the ticket office to the place where you get on the boat. Apparently there are 2 places you can get on the boat and the ticket agent gave us tickets for the wrong location. The staff at the boat were helpful and let us board anyway. It was good that the tour was not fully booked. The boarding area has more than 1 company leaving from that area so it's somewhat of a guessing game as to where you're supposed to go.

Going back hundreds of years Dutch traders exploring the world brought back exotic spices from the Spice Islands (Indonesia). Ever since there has been a connection between the Netherlands and Indonesia. The proprietor doesn't speak English very well so we had a hard time getting seated but he was very warm and friendly. You are given 2 options when you enter: traditional or vegetarian. We chose the traditional. The waiter then brings a small buffet of items to your table so you get to sample many different dishes.

Fun place for a leisure bike ride,"Initially we were going to rent bikes and tour Amsterdam, but after seeing the pace of the riders we decided against that. Instead we rented bikes and made a few laps around Vondelpark. It's a beautiful place and was full of all types of activities and people. We were able to ride our bikes at a pace that suited us without causing issues for other bikers.",July 2018,Vondelpark,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d189384-Reviews-Vondelpark-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful architechture,We flew into Amsterdam but left by train from the central station. It was easy to get to and also easy to purchase tickets.,July 2018,Centraal Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190573-Reviews-Centraal_Station-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great place for a leisurely stroll,"We spent most of a day walking around the canal ring.

Great last German meal before heading home,"Nice airport restaurant. We had Frankfurters (what else!!!) and some other sausages. The service was good and the food very tasty. Like everything at the airport it's a bit overpriced, but what else can you do. Definitely stop by if you have a layover in Frankfurt.",July 2018,Deli Bros.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187337-d5794388-Reviews-Deli_Bros-Frankfurt_Hesse.html,"Frankfurt, Germany",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great German food a little off the beaten tourist path,"We had a lovely German meal at the Klosterhof. It seemed like most of the patrons were locals not tourists. My wife had bratwurst and I had schnitzel with apples, bacon, cheese and a fried egg on top. Very tasty. We laughed when we saw the bottle of water we ordered was more expensive than the big glass of beer I had. Gotta love a place where beer is cheaper than water!!!",July 2018,Klosterhof,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187337-d1014605-Reviews-Klosterhof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html,"Frankfurt, Germany",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Fun to see the craftsmanship and learn of the history,We toured the Royal Delft workshop and museum. The tour starts with a couple short videos. Then you take a self guided tour of the museum with a device that tells about the particular area of the museum (17 in all). Ours was in English but there were several other languages available. They have a lovely garden as well. The gift shop at the end was fun to browse in but the hand painted items were out of our price range. Nice tour that lasted about 1 1/2 hours.,July 2018,Royal Delft - Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188626-d195230-Reviews-Royal_Delft_Koninklijke_Porceleyne_Fles-Delft_South_Holland_Province.html,"Delft, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great place for a bike ride,We rented bikes and rode the paths among the windmills. Two of the windmills are open so you can go inside to see what they look like. Beautiful scenery. I would suggest you get there early as the tour buses showed up toward the end of our time there and it became quite crowded. You can get there by water taxi from Rotterdam.,July 2018,World Heritage Kinderdijk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188629-d321125-Reviews-World_Heritage_Kinderdijk-Kinderdijk_South_Holland_Province.html,"Kinderdijk, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
