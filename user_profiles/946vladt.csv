Great experience - shout out to Mircea!,"Everything as you would expect from such a hotel.

The reason I'm writing this review is to give a massive thank you to the bar manager, Mircea, for his extraordinary hosting at the bar. As it was a special occasion we chose to try the Remy Martin Louis XIII. The tasting was magnificently presented with much enthusiasm by Mircea and it really was an amazing end to a great day for us. Thank you for taking the time, guiding us through the tasting and making the experience unique & magical.

The only reason I cannot offer the full 5 star rating is due to the fact that face masks were not enforced and temperature checks were not performed. We must have been the only ones consistently wearing a mask in the lobby + common areas. As a minor point, I would have liked to have some extra things in the bathroom (cotton buds, toothpaste, etc).",September 2020,Dakota Leeds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186411-d11687380-Reviews-Dakota_Leeds-Leeds_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Leeds, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,5.0
Best meal in Krakow,"I cant begin to describe how amazing the meal, atmosphere and service was. We had the beef tartare, foie gras, tenderloin and venison. Finished the meal with white chocolate and a mushroom ice cream (highly recommend it). The service was hands down the best we have ever had, Tomasz was very attentive, well spoken, polite and funny. Thank you for setting a new benchmark in fine dining for us!",May 2019,Wierzynek Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274772-d697181-Reviews-Wierzynek_Restaurant-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent x2,"Came here twice as a group of 3, everything was perfect from the staff and location to the food and drinks. The staff are attentive and friendly, the views are stunning (we were saying it's the nicest view we've ever had from a restaurant), the food was absolutely brilliant ( get the octopus as a starter!!) and the cocktails were all flawless and each one had its own Thea twist.

Grigoris served us both nights and he really was the cherry on top of the cake for the whole experience. Wishing you all the best, Grigoris!",August 2018,Thea Terrace Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3709146-Reviews-Thea_Terrace_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great!,"Came here yesterday it was very interesting, however make sure to get a private guide otherwise you're really missing out on a lot of details",August 2018,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
The staff is horribly rude,"The location was what you'd expect, gorgeous all around and for the most part untouched. However I have never been to a place where the security guards would yell so much about the smallest things. Not to us, but to other couples. Everything from taking a picture in the wrong place to taking too long for a picture, taking too long to fill up your water bottle, it gave the impression that everyone was being rushed on every little thing and just took away from the experience",August 2018,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Had a great time!,"A must see attraction, worth the climb which is nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. Would come again",August 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
From the outside,"Worth coming here to have a look from the outside, but the entrance fee really isn't worth it in my opinion",August 2018,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
