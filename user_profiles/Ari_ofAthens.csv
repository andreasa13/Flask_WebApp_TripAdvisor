Rich flavours in a pretty space,"We came across Curry Express with a friend when we tried to visit the restaurant formerly operating in the same space. Being hungry and tired, we decided to give it a shot.

My few experiences with Indian food were a tad too spicy for me because I have a very low tolerance for hot dishes. However, Curry Express offers many options for people who like it less spicy. We tried the moderately spicy kebab curry, the non-spicy chicken korma and a great tikka wrap with vegetables and the most refreshing mint sauce. Everything was rich in flavour and very enjoyable. We didn't try the drinks this time but will certainly do it on a next visit. A 5-10 euros per person is enough for a very satisfying meal.

I'd love to see some option for an Indian dessert next time, other than that, it's 5/5 for me and a great value option for ethnic food in the city centre.",September 2020,Curry Express,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d21221685-Reviews-Curry_Express-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
