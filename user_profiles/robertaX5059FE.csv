Great food.,This is one of our regular places to eat while in Athens. It is just a couple minute walk from where we stay. The pasta is very good but my favorite is the caeser salad. It has just enough chicken a little bacon for saltiness and I really like the dressing. The other half gets the salmon. She likes it but I dont eat fish. Can't wait to go back next year.,September 2019,Diva Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2155324-Reviews-Diva_Pizza-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Flight from point A to B as expected and no issues,"Nothing much to say other than it was an uneventful flight. The A330 on the ATH leg is now the 300 and has the upgraded AA interior with new and better seat cushions than the old US Air ones. The IFE is also the newer system which was nice because the old US Air system had bad touch screens that you had to use your headphone plug to push on the screen to get it to work.

Food was fine although the food service on the return flight from Athens is much better than going as there are more snacks on the return trip. Breakfast is the only meal that AA does badly. The Chobani yogurt garbage. Its a funky processed peach flavored goo with a small bag of yard clippings to sprinkle on it and a funky fig bar. When you are in the Philly terminal there are islands selling snacks etc. Pick up a bowl of cereal or two for a better breakfast...",September 2019,American Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729020-Reviews-American-Airlines,World,flights,5.0,3.0
Big....,The temple is much larger than you think it is. Once there standing near the pillars you look up and realize just how tall they are. There are also the remains of Roman baths and other buildings around the main area. Hadrians gate is just outside the entrance as well. This is also one of the very few flat areas in Athens.,September 2019,Temple of Olympian Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242844-Reviews-Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Very big place,"For those that have never visited the port is a very very large place. Make sure you k ow what ship you are going on and what pier it is at. If you get dropped off at the wrong place you may need a taxi to get to your boat on time....

For those coming from the US... There are no gates no real signs nada. It is a whole bunch of piers where the ships dock so no boarding lines no check in building nothing. Just a ship backed up to the pier with its ramp down. It is up to you to make sure you know where your ship is and then just walk up and hand them your ticket.

No the boats will not wait for you. They are typically on time for arrival. On the islands if a boat is scheduled to leave at 2pm it will arrive about 15 minutes before that. All passengers wait on the boat the boat does not wait for you. Once the crowd or people is on the boat they are ready to leave and they will often leave early.

So be early for your boat...

When getting off at a port. Do not stay upstairs filming the docking as you will not have enough time to get off the ship and you will be along for the ride.

So no farting around when your ship gets near port you should be on the car deck ready to get off. A typical stop at a port is 15 minutes.

The ferries run a fast efficient service and will not wait for you.",September 2019,Port of Piraeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189403-d7974687-Reviews-Port_of_Piraeus-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.5
Great ferry as usual,"This is our second year taking bluestar and it is our preferred ferry ship to Naxos. The ship is very well taken care of. It is about 10 years old but they maintain it very well to where you think it's a new ship.

We have taken both the Delos and the Naxos. The Delos is the larger of the two and has nicer and larger cabins though the cabins on the Naxos are basically the size of those on many cruise ships.
The cabins also give you access to the business class seating area. This area on the Naxos is smaller than the Delos but I prefer the design of the Naxos better.

The ships can be crowded in the summer so the reviewa that complain of having to sit on the floor are those that bought an outside deck seat on a windy or rainy day.


Bluestar is our go to ferry in Greece if they go where we want to go. We will leave at odd times just to take their ship over others.",September 2019,Blue Star Ferries,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189403-d8703917-Reviews-Blue_Star_Ferries-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.5
Nicer than the other highspeed ships,"We usually take Bluestar to and from Naxos but this time we couldnt get the cabin we wanted on the Delos on the return trip. We opted for the VIP seating as one trip we took seajets and their ships are well worn... The VIP seating on high speed 4 is up stairs and it is nice and has a large balcony to the stern which is nice. Very comfortable seats which are ata table.
If we were to take the ship again we would get seats in the business class section which is smaller, cheaper and it is at the front of the ship so you can see where you are going.

Overall a great ferry ride but the price of the VIP seats is a little high for not getting any more than business and also the VIP seats cost more than getting a cabin for 2 on Bluestar.",September 2019,Hellenic Seaways,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189403-d1572194-Reviews-Hellenic_Seaways-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.0
Improved this year,They have opened the pathways to the ruins under the museum this year. Very cool seeing the ruins and then the museum on stilts above you and lookong up through the glass floor into the museum.,September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Its the acropolis just go....,"I wont get into describing it as we all k ow what it is. A few tips.

Buy your tickets online or at a ticket booth anywhere EXCEPT at the main north entrance. You can buy tickets at any of the 5 or so sites. $30 for a ticket to all sites and good for a week.

There are water vending machines inside by the south gate nearest the acropolis subway station. 50 cents and bring coins as they often eat cash.

September/October are good weather months to visit.

Very busy from around 10am to 2pm as the cruise ship tours are there then.

Wear hiking shoes leave your flip flops at home.

Sunscreen and carry water with you.


The climb is steep and rough but they have concreted allot this year so it is much smoother but most of it is very rough. If you are not in good shape you will have a tough time. The flights home are full of people who found out the hard way. One time they were needing 15 more wheel chairs than they already had and walking off the plane was like walking through an ER with all the people in casts...",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great ferry ride,"We took the bluestar Delos from Piraeus to Naxos on 9/21. We walked on the ship with no lines at all. There was someone there immediately that took us to the check in counter and had out cabin keys in about 30 seconds and then we were escorted to our room and he even showed us where the AC controls were etc.

Our cabin was very clean as was the bathroom and shower. Having a shower was great as well.
We walked the ship and everything was very clean and well maintained. Much nicer than the other brand of ferry...

No complaints about the ship or the service. The only thing that lacks is the food. Flo doesn't have a great selection of food and the burger place is the only hot food really available and they are not fresh. A little work in the food area and they have a really great boat.

We will be taking their ferry again next year.",September 2018,Blue Star Ferries,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189403-d8703917-Reviews-Blue_Star_Ferries-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.5
Fast but not very comfortable,"We took Bluestar to Naxos and then for the return trip we took Champion jet 1.

The boat was an hour late which seems to be a common trend. Boarding was quick. The boat was at port maybe 10 minutes. We were at the front of the line and by the time we got to the middle of the boat where you show your ticket we were already moving. (very efficient operation)
We were told to head upstairs to the business class seating. Everyone has trouble finding their seats because they have multipule numbers on the seats and there is no logic to their seat numbering and lettering.
The seats are basically a big airline seat. They are nicer than the ones on the first deck and less crowded. When I bought our tickets a month earlier there was only one seat in platinum so we skipped it.

Overall the ship is really starting to show its age. It may look nice in pictures but in person its pretty worn. Even the ceiling and the canvas decoration over the stairs are dirty and worn. The seats are getting rough and not a whole lot of padding left. The cabin of the boat was also warm. I can only imagine how hot it gets in the summer and full of people.

When we go back next year We will take Bluestar for both legs of the trip even though its a longer trip and gets into Piraeus late at night as its cheaper and a much much nicer boat(looks almost like new still).",September 2018,SeaJets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189403-d11765522-Reviews-SeaJets-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",attractions,3.0,2.5
Good room horrible breakfast.,"We are in the hotel as I write this. Hotel room was nice and as expected. Went down for breakfast at 8:30. Eggs were cold sausage was cold. Made a waffle then couldn't find the syrup. They said they were going out to get syrup. Went to get orange juice the orange juice sign was removed as they were out. After I complained to the front desk they put some fresh sausage in the warmer and a little bit of fresh eggs.
The girl running the food area was doing her very best but it's obvious that the upper management isn't keeping adequate stock of supplies. She said her warmer was on from 6:30 this morning and I don't doubt that however the unit isn't heating very well.

The front desk staff were totally ambivalent to the issue and refused to even check herself and had nothing to say. She basically said I don't have to check on anything. The manager was in the room to the left and wouldn't even come out to say anything. It's obvious this is standard operating procedure at this location and they just don't care because it's such a common issue.

I have stayed at other hotels of this brand and they were much better. The breakfast at the others has been a much better selection hot and better quality food not to mention those better locations were actually a cheaper room per night as well.",September 2016,"Country Inn & Suites by Radisson, Dearborn, MI",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g42130-d1588436-Reviews-Country_Inn_Suites_by_Radisson_Dearborn_MI-Dearborn_Michigan.html,"Dearborn, Michigan",hotels,1.0,3.5
Great place and collection of history.,Have been going since a kid. The village is better now than its ever been. Summer is best as there are more things going on but the off season is less crowded.
