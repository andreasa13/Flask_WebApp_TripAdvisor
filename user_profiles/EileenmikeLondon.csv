A comfortable and well placed Inn with quirky breakfast arrangements,"We enjoyed our stay at this conveniently situated hotel outside Cirencester during the covid epidemic and felt safe under well thought out arrangements eg one way systems. We received several useful updates via reception before arrival. Our room was accessed through the pleasant central courtyard and overlooked the river at the back of the property - and was a window into local wildlife. It and the roomy en suite were well appointed but now in need of some modernization. We only ate breakfast at the hotel and found the arrangements rather odd, with the full English breakfast not including toast and the continental breakfast allowing only two selections from the menu: rather spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar. The amounts of different food items also varied from day to day - apparently supplier problems were responsible. However, the table staff were very pleasant and obliging.",September 2020,The Crown of Crucis Country Inn and Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2250961-d570985-Reviews-The_Crown_of_Crucis_Country_Inn_and_Hotel-Ampney_Crucis_Cotswolds_England.html,"Ampney Crucis, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0

Perfect venue for a family get-together,"We reserved a table for 11 people before Christmas mainly based on convenience of location for our party. We were very pleased when they offered us a private room, which suited us perfectly, and on our arrival the staff were very friendly and welcoming. Desite being very busy and three of our party being delayed, there was never any sense of hurrying us to order drinks or food. Our order was taken promptly once we were all settled in and everything arrived in good time and as ordered. We were in the main happy with our meals, although those who had ordered the steak pie found the meat in the middle was barely warm but chose not to complain. We had allowed two hours for our stay but we were given a useful extra hour as by then the restaurant had become less busy. The staff could not have been more helpful and everyone was pleased with the choice of venue.

A great preview to the Acropolis,This is a fantastic archive of the plethora of genuine artifacts from the Acropolis as well as impressive re-creations of many of its famous features such as the Parthenon's pediments. Coupled with well labelled exhibits (in Greek and English) it is an opportunity not to be missed and good value. We would suggest you go before visiting the Acropolis itself.,September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A chance to wander through milennia of history,"Our visit to the Acropolis on a warm, late September day was terrific. One can wander through the various sights of interest at your own pace and marvel at the history and the ancient building skills - admittedly in the presence of many others, but the large site dilutes the numbers. The climb is via many steps but many far less mobile than us managed the ascent to the Parthenon and temples at the summit - and were rewarded with some memorable views, even with scaffolding. We echo advice we were given to visit the Acropolis Museum before this trip as there is a chance to see many of the original artifacts (rather than the replicas on the site itself) and to learn about their long history through well-labelled notes. The whole package is one for life's bucket list despite the typically chaotic queuing system at the quieter south entrance.

"A beautiful ""boutique"" hotel","We have recently returned from a 4 night stay at the Nautilus Dome where we spent an enjoyable time sightseeing and relaxing by the pool (although the unpadded sunbeds can prove uncomfortable after too long!). The hotel itself is very modern and pretty in an attractive ""Santorini""-style set around the central pool which was always very peaceful. Although a little on the small side our room was very clean and well-equipped. As stated elsewhere, there is no breakfast room at the hotel but breakfast items are ordered the night before to your choice of time then brought to your room the next day. All rooms have their own patio with chairs and table. The menu itself was a little limited but the portions very generous. The hotel's position is on a very busy road just outside Thira but getting there and back is made easy with the shuttle to and from a convenient location thanks to Christos and Michael's excellent service. There are a a few shops including a bakery, banks and even a Lidl (!) a short walk from the hotel. The view of the caldera from the roof is stunning, especially at sunset when it can be truly be said to rival anywhere else on the island - even the much-advertised Oia (which is so crowded you have to queue up to take photos of the view!) The only negative point is of course the constant road noise as the front of the hotel is partly open to the road. There is a pleasant bar area looked after by the delightful Efi. We found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful in making sure we enjoyed our time at the Nautilus Dome. Particular thanks to Christos for his excellent advice and good humour!",September 2019,Nautilus Dome,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d949895-Reviews-Nautilus_Dome-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Wouldn't go back!,"The place looked as if it needed an update and a good clean. The meal I ordered was shown as coming with roast potatoes, but I asked if chips could be substituted. Yes of course was the answer but I got the same rather soggy roast potatoes, accompanied by a mean salad covered in balsamic vinegar which didn't improve the potatoes either. However my partner was reasonably happy with his food. Service was not particularly friendly either.

"Delightful hotel, delightful people!","We stayed 5 nights at the Paros Palace and it was a pleasure from beginning to end. Our room was very comfortable with all modern amenities and breakfast on the terrace, with its fine views of Parikia and the port area, is definitely 5*+! It is situated on a fairly busy road but that didn't intrude on our experience. It's a reasonable straight walk to the town but the road lacks pavements in places, so best to go down in daylight then call Stavros for a lift back.

The beach is really not that far away!,"A couple of reviews on here state that it is a 20-30 minute walk from the nearest beach, which I imagine is the Coral Bay beach. However the nearest sandy beach is the one next to the Corallia Beach Hotel which can be access via a pathway round the back of the Panareti apartments. There was an old sign there saying ""To the beach"" but that may have been removed as the pathway is not being maintained. You can also get to the beach via the road at the front of Panareti (the one that goes to the Coral Bay strip).",May 2018,Panareti Coral Bay Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g12616337-d1443711-Reviews-Panareti_Coral_Bay_Resort-Coral_Bay_Peyia_Paphos_District.html,"Coral Bay, Cyprus",hotels,4.0,3.0
Lovely friendly hotel and ideal location,"Hotel Las Olas is an aparthotel which means you get a spacious living area with a kitchenette and full size bathroom. Admittedly the d√©cor and furnishings are due for refurbishment and we found the mattresses rather hard, but everything else was comfortable and spotlessly clean. The location is excellent close to Los Cancajos with easy quick access into Santa Cruz from the bus stop across the road. There is some road noise if you are facing the road at the back of a block but that is not bothersome at night. It's an attractive walk along the sea to Los Cancajos beach and there are a few restaurants and shops along the way. The most enjoyable aspects for us were the friendly and efficient staff, who always greeted us with a smile, and the excellent buffet restaurant offering a wide choice of freshly-cooked food and at a bargain price (wine at 2 euros/glass anyone?). The hotel sits in attractive gardens with three good-sized pools and a pool bar. We hired a car through the hotel and were lucky to enjoy a few sunny days to visit the island's stunning scenery.",March 2019,Hotel Las Olas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g659966-d488944-Reviews-Hotel_Las_Olas-Playa_De_Los_Cancajos_La_Palma_Canary_Islands.html,"La Palma, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.0

A very enjoyable and instructive experience on the simulator helped greatly by the friendly and helpful instructor.,"We have read the contrasting reviews of this attraction with interest. Our visit was on a weekday when the visitor numbers were small and our experience was very positive: we had a warm and helpful reception, the instructor made himself available early and the session (across two simulators) was hugely enjoyable. Our instructor (Tony) deserves particular thanks having advised us on options providing a wide and varied experience, taking time to answer our questions and providing a personal and memorable session - not to mention significant but understated help as co-pilot.

An opportunity gone to waste!,"We ate in the White Hart last evening which has been expensively refurbished by the new owners. It occupies a fairly prime position opposite Godstone Green and has a pleasant interior and a pretty courtyard for outside eating. Unfortunately our rather brusque welcome was not a very encouraging start (I understand there have been staffing issues) but after a short wait we were shown to a good table where our waitress was very friendly and efficient. The menu is rather odd as it offers a variety of pizzas (which are half-price before 7 pm so great for customers with children), a few of which are described as ""white"" meaning no tomato - why? There is also a big choice of steaks priced from ¬£17.95 to ¬£31.95, but not much choice of vegetarian or fish dishes. There is only one pasta dish which is described in typical fashion as ""Heirloom tomatoes, marinated bocconcini, basil, tagliatelle pasta, sourdough crumb"". However I chose the hake with clam risotto and samphire. The hake was a generous portion but the mushy risotto very bland with a little samphire mixed into it and very few clams, if any, detectable. My partner had the pork cutlet with veg which he said was OK for the price. I feel the owners have wasted an opportunity to attract new customers looking for modern and good pub food at a reasonable cost for a midweek meal. It seems to me that the menu is trying to present itself as something rather special - perhaps in competition with The Bell opposite - but our experience was rather disappointing and probably not what most people really want.",August 2018,White Hart,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1936911-d1742779-Reviews-White_Hart-Godstone_Surrey_England.html,"Godstone, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Very good and then not so good,"We were using a Travelzoo voucher for a Superior room, one of the refurbished ones in the modern wing (the web site does make clear which rooms are in the main Victorian part of the hotel and which are not).The room was generous and well-equipped with a huge, very comfortable bed so no complaints there. Signage on site is poor; the grounds are huge and clearer directions to the car park and main reception are needed. Our welcome at Reception was efficient but could have been more friendly. Our voucher included ¬£26 pp towards dinner in the restaurant. The menu was OK but quite limited, indeed the grills were mostly highly-priced steaks of various cuts and there was only one choice of fish.The staff seemed a little overwhelmed but did their best, although our server omitted to tell us about the specials on offer. My OH chose the ""soup of the day"" which turned out to be Asian/Thai style chicken with noodles and an overdose of green chilli which he couldn't finish. We felt the main courses were expensive for what they were, and for the price I feel they could have included some bread. I ordered a side of tenderstem broccoli with chilli, which was again far too hot and did not work with such a delicate vegetable. Our plates were not heated so our food cooled quickly, especially the broccoli which got cold before I could eat half of it. After complaining a staff member kindly returned with a very hot replacement. Breakfast the following morning was of a better standard and choice although it again suffered from service issues, ie. cereal bowls not being replenished and staff, although helpful, not seeming to have specific roles or supervision. We were not asked if we wanted toast so we made our own, then saw other guests being served their toast. Again I questioned this to one of the ladies on duty who said there is no restaurant manager at present. She alerted another more senior lady who came and discussed these issues with us at some length. From that conversation we understood that the hotel is in a transitional period due to a recent takeover and is now trying to attract more leisure business as well as commercial/business bookings. We were surprised that such a well-established hotel (no matter what type of business they served) would not be better organised for their guests. We also heard that a restaurant manager would in post in November, so it is hoped that these service issues will be resolved then.",October 2017,De Vere Latimer Estate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g911451-d1065232-Reviews-De_Vere_Latimer_Estate-Chesham_Buckinghamshire_England.html,"Chesham, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,3.5
Lovely!,"We had a lovely lunch here today (Saturday), choosing ham, egg and chips and one of the veggie dishes of asparagus and roasted butternut squash tart served with a side salad.

The best B&B in Fishguard!,"Well, it surely must be as we spent the most comfortable and enjoyable night at Pentower. As mentioned by others, Tony and Mary are the perfect hosts and the hotel itself is absolutely delightful. We booked fairly late and they could only offer a room described as their ""single"" but it turned out to be an elegant and comfortable room with a large modern bathroom and king-size bed! There were lovely touches such as fresh freesias on the mantelpiece, and plenty of storage and useful accessories. The house overlooks Fishguard harbour and if you are as lucky as we were with the weather, the views are beautiful.

Great little pub,"Stopped here for light lunch en route to visit a nearby NT garden. We just wanted a snack lunch so ordered ""sandwiches"". What we got were freshly-baked baguettes with generous tasty fillings (fat prawns, chicken and bacon) served with a fresh salad garnish and tortilla chips. All delicious and a steal at ¬£4.50! The garden had recently been created to take advantage of the lovely views, which made our visit more memorable. The pub itself is quite small and basic inside so could do with cheering up, which I imagine the friendly and welcoming landlords will be doing as it gets established (they've only been there a year).

Perfect for a birthday celebration,"Took my other half for a ""posh"" meal to celebrate this birthday and this was the perfect venue as we both enjoy seafood and there's plenty of choice on offer. We went a la carte with 3 courses - not the cheapest you will find in Beckenham but they also have set menus for smaller budgets. I had the fish soup and he had the crab starter, followed by the aptly-named Neptune Symphony and grilled trout, all delicious and freshly prepared. We also ordered side dishes of potatoes and mixed vegetables, which were generous enough to share.

Not impressed!,"Sorry to say we had a disappointing experience at Franklins last evening. We met with friends who booked the table having enjoyed it before. None of us wanted anything on the starters menu so we went straight into the main course. The duck breast three of us ordered was generous in size and well-cooked, but only came with some watercress and a few tiny overcooked new potatoes cut in half. Extra vegetables are charged for, which included ""greens"" that looked like plain Savoy cabbage just plonked in a dish, and plain boiled new potatoes in their skins. The bread was chewy and delicious but they do not provide side plates and only a paper tablecloth. We ordered our desserts and coffees at the same time but oddly the coffees arrived first. Even more odd was my dessert described as ""strawberry shortcake"" which consisted of a soggy biscuit with a few halves of strawberries and a blob of mousse on top and seemed to have been microwaved to such a degree that I almost burnt my mouth after taking the first bite! The custard tart was deemed to be not as good as M&S's, but our friend who had the mint ice cream said it was good if strongly minty. Personally we felt the whole meal to be over-priced for the two courses we had, and given the choice of restaurants in Lordship Lane I think we could have done much better elsewhere. We eat out fairly regularly but won't be returning to Franklins.",June 2015,Franklins,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d802292-Reviews-Franklins-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Much improved this year,"I am sorry to read the last review as we stayed at the same resort at the same time as the last reviewer and our experience was quite different (and we are quite fussy ourselves!). The resort has had its problems with maintenance over recent years but we were very pleased to see it had improved a great deal this time. The apartments and grounds are kept very clean and although the food on the set menu can be repetitive, it was good quality in generous portions and very good value at 4 courses for 12 euros. I cannot recall eating any frozen veg and the soup and salad were obviously freshly prepared. We ate in about 9 times and had no complaints, admittedly the waiting staff are East European but were pleasant and attentive and the Cypriot manager George does a brilliant job keeping things running smoothly. It is off the beaten track (which we prefer) so a hire car is recommended, but there is a bus route 5 minutes walk away that goes past Coral Bay and all the way to Paphos harbour. As regards the hairs on the duvet, I'm pretty sure the beds have only sheets and blankets owing to the heat at this time of year. I would have understood any complaint about noisy and disruptive guests in the bar late at night as there certainly were complaints about that, but in the other respects many of the criticisms below bear no relation to our experience so I wonder if they were staying at the same place?!",May 2015,Panareti Coral Bay Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g12616337-d1443711-Reviews-Panareti_Coral_Bay_Resort-Coral_Bay_Peyia_Paphos_District.html,"Coral Bay, Cyprus",hotels,4.0,3.0
More a pub than a restaurant,"We were a party of 9 looking for somewhere to eat in Suresnes last Friday night. Having researched most of the restaurants in hope of finding somewhere we would all like, we finished up at Au Bureau. The staff were very friendly and helpful in finding us a table we could all fit round.The decor and furnishings are pub-like and the menu bears this out. We all chose different meals; I went for the Bureau burger. Service was extremely slow, even for our drinks. My burger was advertised as having cheddar but it came with the cheese you find in those plastic sachets. The meat patty and chips were fine though. My daughter ordered a medium steak which was well done, so it was replaced with her second choice of a plate of pasta, which arrived well after the rest of the party had finished eating. My sister ordered a salad which the menu said came with an egg, except it didn't despite her enquiry. The menu has what seems to be a kind of German pizza which looked very basic. The place soon filled up so is obviously popular but it seems they were unable to cope with demand on a busy night. IMO the food was not as good as your average Wetherspoons, and is more expensive (but it is Paris).",April 2015,Au Bureau,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g196592-d6481098-Reviews-Au_Bureau-Suresnes_Hauts_de_Seine_Ile_de_France.html,"Suresnes, France",restaurants,3.0,3.5
OK - but not that good!,"We made a reservation here for our last evening in Paris having read the very favourable reviews on TA and were frankly rather disappointed. It's an interesting, slightly quirky little restaurant and the staff/owners are certainly very friendly and welcoming. But to be honest we didn't think the food was as wonderful as most of the other reviewers. The menu is quite limited to pizza or pasta, with the only meat on offer being veal (unless you count spaghetti bolognese, which may of course be veal too). I would have liked some fish or chicken but failing that I opted for a veggie pasta dish in a cream sauce which was pretty ordinary. My other half had the veal escalope with spaghetti in a tomato sauce, which was no better than at our local family-run Italian - and for a much cheaper price! Our desserts were pleasant enough but not outstanding. The cost of around 50 euros without drinks was not great value; in fact the night before we had enjoyed delicious 3 courses each nearby for the same price (reviewed elsewhere).

As for the food ... we opted for the 3-course set menu which offered plenty of choice. I had smoked salmon with Puy lentils to start followed by skate wing on a bed of fresh spinach and a cream sauce with capers. Delicious! My other half had vegetable soup then a kind of duck cottage pie which he was less keen on. Our desserts were tarte tatin and creme caramel.

Despite it's being so quiet the first course took a long time to arrive which didn't matter too much on that occasion, but this also been our previous experience so I would recommend taking this into account.

Lived up to expectations - and more,"Just returned from two weeks at the St Raphael and have to agree with other reviewers that this is a lovely hotel with the most friendly and helpful staff we've ever encountered. We had booked a twin room with sea view but the one we were given was a double, so this was put right quickly and in pleasant way. The room was spacious, very clean and comfortable. We arrived late about 10.30 pm but were still able to get a snack meal in the Palladium restaurant. The hotel is located in a ""suburban"" area about 14 km east of Limassol but getting there on the local bus is cheap and easy. If hiring a car it is usefully close to an exit on the A1 motorway, but this made for some road noise even on the 5th floor. Two beautiful pools, one with a swim-up bar and all the drinks you could wish for - bliss! All-inclusive buffet meals were excellent and breakfast was our favourite meal with plenty of choice of hot food, fresh fruit, pastries etc. Lovely to sit outside with coffee and feed the resident cats with tit-bits! The hotel was pretty full with Russians vastly outnumbering the Brits, but as we think the Russians favoured the private beach there were always plenty of free sunbeds round the pools. If pressed for a negative I would say the numbers of guests in the restaurants at peak times made the huge rooms quite busy and noisy, but guests were allocated tables in a most efficient and charming manner. We always leave tips for the staff but there is no system for general sharing of gratuities so you have to tip individually, which makes it more awkward as all the staff were excellent. It was suggested we leave envelopes at Reception marked for the restaurant, bar and kitchen staff to share out which we did.",September 2014,St Raphael Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g20361178-d230956-Reviews-St_Raphael_Resort-Pyrgos_Limassol.html,"Pyrgos, Cyprus",hotels,5.0,4.5

A great new find,"I have been looking for a good local restaurant - not a gastropub - to take friends for Sunday lunch, and fortunately saw some positive reviews for Manuel's so booked a table. We were not disappointed: the roast beef was tender and delicious and the service friendly and efficient. Our meals came with freshly-cooked vegetables, though my other half would have been happier if Yorkshire pud had been offered (but he's from the North). The only other issue we had was a longish delay in being served our main courses, but Manuel explained that this was due to the joint not being sufficiently cooked which had to go back into the oven, so hopefully just a one-off. The decor is smart modern and it was lovely to have real linen on the table. Parking nearby is on the road at the bottom of Gipsy Hill. Altogether a very pleasant experience which we hope to repeat soon.",September 2014,Manuel's Restaurant and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d5784898-Reviews-Manuel_s_Restaurant_and_Bar-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Lovely garden but ...,"We visited the Dulwich Wood House pub last evening with friends, not having been there for some time. I had heard that the food was pretty average but it was a lovely evening to sit outside with a cool drink and enjoy a meal out.Three of us ordered the burgers which were in fact quite good. The chips that accompanied them tasted OK but were rather pale and didn't seem very freshly-cooked to me. My partner had the fish and chips which was meant to come with mushy peas but this item was missing from the plate (he wouldn't let me complain!). The fish itself looked a little over-cooked but he said it tasted fine. The menu is not extensive and prices are I think too high for the standard of food and presentation (¬£12-18 for a main course). I was hoping to return for Sunday lunch with other friends in a few weeks but will unfortunately have to look elsewhere, which is a pity as it has a lovely garden and conservatory and is well-located in a leafy area near Dulwich Woods.",July 2014,"The Wood House, Dulwich",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d4858621-Reviews-The_Wood_House_Dulwich-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5

Great day out for an uphill walk,"The falls are very impressive and well worth a visit. We were lucky to visit on a sunny day, with a rainbow at the bottom awaiting our cameras.

Good budget hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights recently and had no complaints at all about the hotel or facilities which have recently been refreshed and were very clean. Breakfast is very good with plenty of choice including lovely fresh fruit and yogurt (though the plastic-wrapped bread could be improved on). Reception staff were pleasant and very helpful. However we did have a few complaints about the restaurant food and service. The restaurant manager who seemed to be on duty was not at all welcoming or polite when we arrived for dinner and subsequently did not make an appearance, leaving everything to the young staff. The set menu seemed good value but our salmon caesar salads were pretty uninspiring and my salmon was partly uncooked. Our waiter was polite and pleasant but didn't seem to have had much, if any, training. Our drinks order didn't arrive without a reminder, likewise the chips which should have been served with the salad as shown on the menu, and we were rather irritated by several interruptions of ""have you guys finished?"" when we plainly hadn't! This is a great pity and likely due to the inexperience of our waiter, but it does show a lack of care and concern on behalf of hotel management. Although it didn't spoil our visit and we would stay there again, we will not be eating dinner with them next time we book.",July 2013,Mercure Wetherby Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190818-d192679-Reviews-Mercure_Wetherby_Hotel-Wetherby_Leeds_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Wetherby, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,3.5

Nice little hotel in great location,"We stayed there at the same time as the previous reviewer and we were also there as part of a tour (with Page & Moy). This is a nice friendly hotel providing a very decent breakfast and as already stated, it is located perfectly within walking distance of many of Istanbul's attractions. Although there are a couple of restaurants situated directly opposite the hotel there are plenty more (and IMHO better) options only a few streets away. The Maywood is also close to the tram which gets you round the city very efficiently and cheaply. Our room was of a good size and kept very clean with a mini-fridge, kettle and selection of teas provided. My only criticism would be the lumpy pillows!",June 2012,Maywood Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293974-d1427226-Reviews-Maywood_Hotel-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5

Pleasant way to spend an hour or so but ...,We enjoyed a river boat trip down the Bosphorus though it wasn't the most interesting excursion we had in Istanbul. The views of the city are certainly different from the water and of course the air is much cooler.

Don't leave Istanbul without seeing it,"Another must-see although there are long queues to get in and like most top attractions, despite its size it gets very crowded. It's easy to get to and you need a good few hours to see it all, though we didn't have time to get into most of the various exhibition rooms.

So much to see!,Istanbul has so much history to offer the tourist and after doing the major attractions it's great to just wander round the streets taking in the atmosphere.

Our experience not as bad nor as good as others!,"It's interesting that the previous reviews of this hotel are so variable. We spent about a week there as part of our Page & Moy tour and although some of the criticisms are justified, overall it was a pleasant enough experience. Our room was not one of the renovated ones but was large and clean with excellent air-con which was really needed. I found the large bed too hard but some people may prefer that. The hotel's position is lovely on a narrow beach with views along the coast to Kusadasi, and the town is easy enough to access as described elsewhere.

The food is OK and there's plenty of choice, though obviously not to everyone's (probably British) taste. There's a poor selection of 2 cereals mainly suited to children at breakfast but plenty of breads and pastries, jams, yogurt etc plus scrambled and hard-boiled eggs and limited fruit availability. Omelettes and friend eggs are made to order and pancakes are freshly-made in the outside area.The milk is strangely thin and coffee from a machine disappointing. I also couldn't eat the butter as it tasted rather odd to me. There was enough choice of main courses at lunch and dinner (though don't expect much in the way of vegetables) but there were lots of salads and desserts at dinner were very good with plenty of cakes, fruit such as peaches, cherries and water melon plus a selection of ice creams in the outside area. The criticism about the food being lukewarm is a common one with buffet meals in big hotels but we didn't find it much of a problem as the weather was so hot and turnover so fast it's unlikely to have been kept very long. We drank very little of the local wine or spirits but the beer and soft drinks were fine. There is also an ""a la carte"" restaurant which you have to book at reception in advance, but don't be fooled - the set menus provide much the same food as In the main restaurant but are waiter-served with long delays between courses!However It provided a nicer ambiance away from the hordes in the main restaurant. Between meals you can snack at the Perge cafe most of the day if you wish and I certainly didn't lose any weight! We were saddened by the volume of food wastage that occurs with some greedy people taking large platefuls of perfectly-good food then leaving it on the table uneaten to be thrown away.

We did not try the spa or turkish bath though others in our group did and said it was very good.

Unlike some other reviewers we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly (though the reception staff perhaps less so). Overall we enjoyed our stay but not the crowds, so this hotel was too big for our taste.",June 2012,Tusan Beach Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297972-d508157-Reviews-Tusan_Beach_Resort-Kusadasi_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Kusadasi, Turkey",hotels,3.0,4.0
Wonderful,"A must-see for anyone visiting the area. It was very hot when we visited and there's not much shade available but lots to see and the restoration is well-done, giving you a good impression of what it must have been like originally.

Great food and friendly service,"We visited this lovely restaurant located in the cobbled centre of Broadstairs as a birthday treat for me, and a great ""find"" it turned out to be. I couldn't have been happier with my choice of mixed seafood starter followed by sea bass on a bed of spinach, all beautifully prepared and presented to order. My other half had the duck breast in cherry sauce which was just as delicious. It was hard to decide which pud to have but the platter of mini desserts was perfect to share. I wish we lived nearer as if so, it would definitely become a favourite. Thanks to all this plus the exceptionally friendly service and personal attention we really enjoyed our evening.

Great food and friendly service,"I really like the Prezzo menu and think it's the best of the ""Italian-style"" chains (and in Beckenham there is plenty of competition!) They usually have special deals available and it's often possible to get good discounts with on-line vouchers, which makes a weekday meal there a very affordable treat. I also like their choice of wines which are reasonably-priced .The Beckenham restaurant is conveniently placed in the middle of the High Street and is quite big, modern and very clean.

Great week's holiday and excellent value for money,"It's difficult to know what I can add to other reviewers' comments except to say this is a perfect spot for a relaxing and enjoyable holiday. We were there for only one week and hired a car for 2 days to see the rest of the island. There are a number of historical sites that are worth visiting and some of the coastal scenery is very pretty, but most of the resorts we visited were busy and the beaches crowded. The old capital Ciutadella is only a short bus ride away and a definite must-see. The hotel itself is, as has already been described at length, kept very clean particularly on the inside - the outside not so much as while we stayed there was mud and vegetation from the trees left unremoved around the outside seating area. The hotel staff are very pleasant and helpful and the entertainment programme appreciated by most people. The hotel is all-inclusive and we were impressed with the quality, quantity and choice of food, although I did feel the standard went down slightly as the week progessed with some strange combinations being offered (such as sliced roast lamb in a curry sauce!) It seems a shame not to offer some Spanish dishes but there was always a pasta dish available. The desserts were also of variable quality but the choice and availability of fresh fruit was always a welcome alternative. Our room was 316 and with only a very small lift available we hoped the walk to the third floor would counteract our over-indulgence in the restaurant! All in all it was a very good choice for us (a middle-aged couple) particularly for the price we paid with Thomas Cook.",July 2011,Globales Cala Blanca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g659631-d292566-Reviews-Globales_Cala_Blanca-Cala_Blanca_Menorca_Balearic_Islands.html,"Menorca, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.0
Lovely hotel with excellent food and service,"We've just returned from a 10-day stay in this hotel. As mentioned previously, the hotel has been renovated in the last couple of years and is now up to a high standard in terms of appearance and service. I believe the star rating is based on the hotel's amenities and the Corinthia Palace would qualify for its 5 stars as it has everything you could possibly want (although the hairdressers is currently being used as a Sicilian property agents!) We stayed on a half-board basis (booked through a tour company) and would recommend this as the standard of food (4 delicious courses!) and presentation in the main restaurant (Corinthia room) are excellent. Because of this we were not even tempted try the Rickshaw or the pizza/pasta restaurant. Also there are only 2 other restaurants in the near vicinity. The area is mainly residential and is therefore pretty quiet, and the nearby Presidential Palace and San Anton gardens are well worth visiting. It's an easy ride into Valletta, which is also a must-see. We really enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to anyone, but mainly for couples.",September 2010,Corinthia Palace Malta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1182415-d229115-Reviews-Corinthia_Palace_Malta-San_Anton_Island_of_Malta.html,"Island of Malta, Malta",hotels,5.0,4.5
