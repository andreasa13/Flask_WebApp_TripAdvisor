Really Great Class,"We had so much fun, learned a lot, and ate great food.

Fun...but,"It was very informative and the food was really great. However, I am not a good cook which is one of the reasons I signed up for the class, and I feel the only thing I could make again with confidence is the recipe I worked on in class.

Good in a pinch,"Someone told us we MUST stop here on our way to Ghost Ranch. After reading the reviews I really expected more. They seem to carry a little bit of everything, but it’s just a store.

Amazing View,"We enjoyed a very nice dinner here with a wonderful view of the Acropolis lit up at night. There was only one gluten-free main course option, and while it was very good, I prefer more choices. Also, because of the way they had our table set up, I took a fall when getting up from my chair. There is a raised platform against the wall and they set the table lengthwise along that platform so four people in our party had the back of their chair just a foot or so away from the step down. I missed the step getting up and fell on my a**.

Terrible Service!,"The manager at our hotel recommended this place to us and made our reservation. One would think that the restaurant would want to continue to get these types of referrals, but we had such poor service that clearly they don’t care. The food was very good, and the atmosphere in the outdoor space lovely, but my husband actually had to get up from the table and interrupt a waiter from playing on his phone at ask for menus. It didn’t improve the rest of the evening.
