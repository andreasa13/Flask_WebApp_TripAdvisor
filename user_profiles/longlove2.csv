Fish Lake City,"This is a nice quiet place to spend the day and chill, drink, eat and swim. The water is very calm and you can have a leisurely swim in the lake which wasn't packed when we went.
The food is basic but will do the job in holding you before going somewhere else.
If you get a taxi there you will have to get the staff at the front desk to call a taxi for you when you leave.
Definitely worth a visit for the day lovely lake in Athens.",September 2020,Lake Vouliagmeni,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562635-d1783442-Reviews-Lake_Vouliagmeni-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Vouliagmeni, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Good visit,"I went to the Acropolis on a nice sunny day, we got there before midday and walked straight in. If you are travelling with another under 25 and from the EU it is free, make sure that person has ID, €20 saved which wasn't bad.
You are only allowed to bring in water so be warned as we brought some nice slushy drinks and then had to finish them before going in and the people who know your going to the Acropolis won't tell you that you cannot enter with the drinks they are selling.
Very nice sight, it wasn't over crowded and I would say you need 1.5 hours max to do it all in a nice pace.",September 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Lovely Hotel,"My son and I arrived at the hotel late on Saturday night and were immediately checked in and given a complimentary upgrade which was greatly received.
The receptionist a lovely lady gave us some tips where we could find some authentic Greek food which didn't disappoint.
The hotel room I found a little on the small side but to be fair we were not there to spend loads of time in the hotel so this was fine. We loved the shower that had a very strong water pressure, the tv wasn't good as most of our channels didn't work but once again we watched stuff on YouTube and this wasn't a problem.
Breakfast was good and we were taken care of by two equally lovely ladies I didn't ask anyone's names which was rude of me but the service was top notch and I couldn't fault it.
The breakfast was a three course breakfast I call it with, pastries, coffee, a boiled egg and bread, then a warm wrap or sandwich with orange juice freshly squeezed to wash it down.
The hotel is centrally located and we walked to all the restaurants we want to dine in we went to the Acropolis which was like a 15 slow walk and Lake vouliagmeni which cost us €10 in a cab.

Finally, all in all it was a good trip topped off by a good hotel with really friendly staff which compliments the establishment.",September 2020,The Artist Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d14985602-Reviews-The_Artist_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Amazing Hotel,"Where do I start, the check in was quick and there wasnt anyone around when we arrived to check in at around 16:30. We had a city room and the hotel was buzzing as it was memorial weekend. Our room was nice clean the the 2 queen beds were perfect.
There are lots of restaurants within the hotel so if you do not wish to leave you can have a lazy day just in the hotel. There are 3 pools, one is a day/nightclub pool which you will have to pay to get in with no concessions on entry. The other two pools are free and for me equally as good depending on what your looking for.
We went down and paid for an upgrade and the fountain view was amazing and well worth the money, the view is to die for and you have a view of the fountain and the strip what more could you ask for. On one morning we couldn't be asked to walk to a restaurant within the hotel as this hotel like most of hotels in Las Vegas are about the size of a Westfield shopping mall or bigger.
Finally I would recommend this hotel it is morden hip and the place to be.",June 2019,"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d1829539-Reviews-The_Cosmopolitan_of_Las_Vegas_Autograph_Collection-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,4.0,4.5
Our Wedding,"Where do I start, we were coming to Capo Bay for our wedding and on arrival we went to the reception and was immediately given some local drink and a bottle water as it was hot.
We booked a sea view room with an upgrade to the deluxe suite on our wedding night but upon check in we were told that we had been upgraded to the deluxe suite for 6 nights which was absolutely amazing way to start our wedding/holiday.
We were shown to our suite and told how to use all the equipment in our suite. The suite was set over two floors with two showers and a hot tub with a separate balcony.
Moving onto our wedding after all this was why we were here. Katerina was wonderful and knew how to facilitate our wedding and gave us guidance throughout our planning and what we needed to what we didn't need and nothing wasn't to much. Anna was equally as helpful and helped us tremendously throughout our stay and made our stay enjoyable and stress free.
Staying in the suite enables us to have breakfast in the koi bar up to 11am and it is not a buffet style breakfast as you can order from a menu. The Koi quieter and romantic also good for some solo time if you so desire.
Onto the wedding day Katerina and Anna were on deck and to be honest as long as I saw them I felt at ease. We had arranged everything prior so on our wedding day my wife and I were not questioned but left to enjoy the day which was one of the best days in my life and went by without a glitch.
The food on our wedding day was exquisite we had no complaints and we are both fussy people. We went for the BBQ buffet menu and there was more than enough food and everybody loved it.
On our 6th day we had to move rooms as the deluxe suite had been booked but we were moved to the junior suite and allowed to check out the following day when we desired which was a lovely touch to what was an amazing wedding/holiday now honeymoon not to forget the champagne breakfast in our room and the 3 course dinner.
Finally to conclude an amazing stay, lovely hotel in a central location perfect and close to everything in the local area do not hesitate and book to stay at Capo Bay if your in Protaras.",October 2018,Capo Bay Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g667803-d500747-Reviews-Capo_Bay_Hotel-Protaras_Paralimni_Famagusta_District.html,"Protaras, Cyprus",hotels,4.0,4.5
Lovely Food,"I went to Blue Marlin with 12 guys, we had booked a table months ago for 6 people but on the day everyone wanted to come, isn't it always the way.
We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant and service we received was good. I went for the seabass which was for 2 people and it was filleted in from of me and the seabass was cooked to perfection.
The service was attentive without being overbearing.
Finally we had to rush off at the end because we had another appointment but the boat service was quick and efficient and I would recommend Blue Marlin.",September 2018,Blue Marlin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187460-d1142772-Reviews-Blue_Marlin-Ibiza_Balearic_Islands.html,"Ibiza, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Upset at our table being given away,"Not a happy bunny at all after me and my family called the ivy as we were running slightly late due to parking. Our booking was for 15:45 and I called the ivy and the message said that bookings are held for 20 minutes after the booking. We arrived at 16.00 and to our shock our table had been given away. I asked why our table had been given away when we were not 20 minutes away and the lady said they called and there was no answer. Well I'm sorry love I was driving and seeing that the message states that the table will be available up to 20 minutes after the booking we had to leave with our tails between our legs on Mothers day I am not happy at all.
Message to The Ivy Cafe change the message which states tables will be held for 20 minutes as it is a lie and as it was busy I'm sure that was the reason.",March 2018,The Ivy Tower Bridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d12670367-Reviews-The_Ivy_Tower_Bridge-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Igloo Experience,"We went to the Igloo on the first Saturday that it opened which was the 16th December 2017.
We took the gondola up to the mountain which included the fondue for a total of 127 CHF which was £97 for my partner and I.
The ride up there was exciting and views where amazing, it had been snowing that morning so the mountains looked amazing and it took my focus off how high I was which was a good thing.
Once we reached the top we were pointed to the direction of the igloo and it was like a 2 min walk. Once inside we were seated. There were a number of rooms of different sizes with different sculptures in different rooms.
Once seated we had our fondue with a drink, warm drink mind you. We took loads of pictures and it wasn't that cold at all to be fair but make sure you wear think socks or your toes might drop off lol.
All in all it was a really good experience which shouldn't be missed.",December 2017,Fondue-Iglu Engstligenalp,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g198862-d4149227-Reviews-Fondue_Iglu_Engstligenalp-Adelboden_Bernese_Oberland_Canton_of_Bern.html,"Adelboden, Switzerland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Outstanding service and views,"I had read several reviews of this hotel and had to put it to the test.

My partner and I arrived on Friday our room wasn't ready so we used the spa area in the interim while our room was being prepared. The spa area was clean which is important to us and the outside heated pool with a view to kill for was breathtaking. After 2 hrs which went very quickly mighy i add we were shown to our room.

Once at our room we were told about the restaurant and breakfast times and the whereabouts of everything.

The hotel staff made our stay truly amazing, Johnny in the restaurant downstairs was hospitable and funny giving us advice on some good dishes. The ladies in reception were equally just as helpful and booked our visit to the igloo up the mountain which is a must. The lady at the bar was also very nice and gave me tips and on one evening when I was craving some biscuits she got me some, lifesaver.

To get to the igloo you must take a gondola up the mountain. We drove so parked outside the gondola station and purchased a ticket which cost CHF 127 for the two of us and came with the signiture dish fondue which is melted cheese and bread to dip into the cheese, not my thing but my partner said it was nice.

We dined in the hotel restaurant which isn't like us but to be fair after a long day and the snow we couldn't be asked to leave the hotel. Outside the restaurant there are small boxes with a little treat for you, just look for your room number I won't spoil the surprise and look in the box each day.

Finally, our last day was here, it was a Sunday so breakfast was being served until 12pm so we had a spa morning, I used the gym then had a brunch at 11:30am which set us up nicely for our 2.5 hr journey back to Zurich airport.

Thank you to all the staff at the Cambrian the best hotel I've stayed in not for the looks or decor but the staff and service was second to none and I've travelled the world over.",December 2017,The Cambrian,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g198862-d231843-Reviews-The_Cambrian-Adelboden_Bernese_Oberland_Canton_of_Bern.html,"Adelboden, Switzerland",hotels,5.0,4.5
Brilliant,Forget all the hype of Mambo and head here. My fiancee and I dined here and watched the sunset for a fraction of the price we would of spent elsewhere. There was live music from a gentleman playing the sax which made this visit so memorable.,September 2017,Kasbah,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g652116-d2187503-Reviews-Kasbah-Sant_Antoni_de_Portmany_Ibiza_Balearic_Islands.html,"Ibiza, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
The Wall,I went to see this ironic landmark which to be fair is just a wall. I think of you are hoping on seeing something spectacular don't get your hopes up because at the end of the day it is just a wall. By the memorial there is a church where they used to pray for the individuals who had lost their lives trying to get over the wall. Also the shooting tower where the guards used to shoot people trying to get over is still there. All in all it is a place just to go in order to say you have been there and done that.,July 2017,Berlin Wall Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274887-d10770659-Reviews-Berlin_Wall_Memorial-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",attractions,3.0,4.0
Memorial Weekend at the MGM,We knew that we were coming to Las Vegas on a very busy holiday but check in was quick and easy. The main entrance into the MGM is grand just like what you would expect. It does not have a hotel feel to it and isn't personal so if your looking for a nice cosy hotel forget it. This is by far the biggest hotel I have ever stayed in during my lifetime and I have been around. The corridors are so long that you can barely see the end of them and it was noisey at time but this was to be expected. The room was ok and had everything that you needed. Don't remove anything from the mini bar and store your own drinks or anything else as you will be charged $50 for the pleasure of doing so. There is an ice machine at the end of each corridor so there is no need to put your drinks in the fridge. You can smoke inside the hotwl and practically anywhere inside the hotel including the club's which I found wear so your clothes may smell of smoke if your in the casino for long periods of time. All in all I think there are several other hotels that I would like to stay in but because of the history I chose to stay here and I've been there and done it now. I would rather stay in the Cosmopolitan or the Encore which is further out of the hussle and bussle.,May 2017,MGM Grand Las Vegas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d91891-Reviews-MGM_Grand_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,4.0,4.0
Good Hotel,"I went to NYC Row with 6 friends. The hotel is in a very good location and for us being used to walking around in London we could walk to most places that we wanted to visit.

Weekend Break,"I stayed here with my fiancée over a weekend in January. The hotel was very easy to get to, we took a bus straight from the airport which took about 15 minutes. The hotel is opposite the 3 Arena and there is a tram line which is right outside the hotel which can take you into town about 10 minutes away. There isn't a lot to do in the area of the hotel but this could be a blessing when you want to get some well deserved rest.",January 2017,The Gibson Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186605-d1765611-Reviews-The_Gibson_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.5
Birthday Dinner,We went to Kalamies for my birthday dinner. This was our second time visiting Kalamies in two years and the service is excellent but not overwhelming. The owner I think comes around and talks with all his customers to make sure that they are happy with the food and can make some really good suggestions. If you you visit and your a fish lover the fish mezze is a must and is a steal for €22.95 per person and is hard to finish. Also this restaurant is one of if not the best fish restaurant in Cyprus.,April 2017,Kalamies Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g667803-d2697515-Reviews-Kalamies_Restaurant-Protaras_Paralimni_Famagusta_District.html,"Protaras, Cyprus",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Very insightful,I visited the Anne Frank House with my partner and found it very insightful. I would firstly recommend that you book your ticket online beforehand as booking opens up 2 months before.
