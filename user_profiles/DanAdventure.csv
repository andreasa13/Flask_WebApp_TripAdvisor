Great food,WAs very surprised by my recent visit to Beefeater Horsham. Staff were lovely and the food was great. Reasonable sized portions for the price paid.

Dreadful takeaway,"The Indian Plaza used to be a great restaurant and take away. Sadly, over the last few months it has gone down hill. This perhaps has something to do with the new owners. First, they ow only accept cash only, considering they used to accept credit card, this would suggest some form of avoidance. Second, when collecting the curry, the heating was off - the place was freezing and none of the staff were wearing PPE. And finally, the family meal we ordered was bland, incorrect items were given, the curry all had a significant amount of oil and the popadoms were stale.",December 2020,The Indian Plaza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g644360-d949368-Reviews-The_Indian_Plaza-Ashton_under_Lyne_Tameside_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Ashton-under-Lyne, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Not covid secure,"While we were happy with the food, the drinks and especially the price we were disappointed that the staff did not enforce covid policy. Kitchen staff did not wear a face covering, customers were not asked to wear them when entering and customers also went to the counter to order (while sitting in).",October 2020,Coffee Cat UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190725-d13196295-Reviews-Coffee_Cat_UK-Ipswich_Suffolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Overwhelming food and poor tipping policy,"First, I thought the service we received was excellent. The waiter was outstanding and went the extra mile at all times. However, the food quantity and overall bland taste become overwhelming after a few mouth fulls. Even the next day taking the food home and having it, still had the same problem. For the price, the quality of the food is below par.

My greatest issue was with the tipping policy, as the waiter had been excellent, I asked if the tip would go directly to him, in the Covid world, not carrying cash. He said a proportion would go to him, when a queried how much of £15 would go to him, he estimated 30p, as the rest of the tip is given amongst all the staff. Upon further discussion, it transpires that if I pay over the tip amount of £15 (via card), say £20, that extra £5 is not given to the staff, but the company keeps it, all in the name of Covid.

After waiting 20 minutes next to the serve station we had to flag over the waitress (Niccole) to order our drinks and food. She was unhelpful, despondent and very short. She was also using her phone multiple times and very difficult to flag down. With the high price paid, it is important to have a good experience. It sadly tarnished ours.

I strongly recommend you get to Machu Picchu as early as possible, it gets very VERY busy as the morning goes on and you'll end up waiting (in queues to move around) and have loads of tourist in your photos. Some other tios:

1. The Inca Bridge was excellent, it hardly has any tourists (all scared of heights I assume). Don't believe those who says its a small path you have plenty of space to move comfortably.

2. Make sure you leave early to get the bus, the queue gets crazy to get down the mountain! Be prepared to wait at least an hour.

3. BE CAREFUL: The only restaurant at Machu Picchu will only let you pay in US Dollars, they also add a 10% tip to every order (they don't mention it to you). The service is poor and the food is of low quality. Therefore, take your own food.

Overall a great experience, just very busy.",April 2018,Santuario Historico de Machu Picchu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294318-d668949-Reviews-Santuario_Historico_de_Machu_Picchu-Machu_Picchu_Sacred_Valley_Cusco_Region.html,"Machu Picchu, Peru",attractions,5.0,5.0
Lares Trek IS worth the effort,"This was one of the hardest, and at the same time most rewarding Trek's I have ever done. The Lares Trek is the hidden gem of routes to Machu Picchu, its very quiet (many tourists choose to do the Inca Trail), the views are amazing and the ability to push yourself to 4,800 meters - which is difficult. The campsites were of high quality with flush toilets and cold showers.

Be prepared for a hard trek, the path is very rocky and muddy, there is no walkway! Make sure you have a good pair of hiking boots and make sure you rent hiking poles. They really do come in handy!

On the Lares Trek you will encounter many impoverished children and families, try to bring some toys etc to hand out out, they really will appreciate it.

TIP: Take small change, you'll need to pay for toilets along the way. They will not have change to hand out!

We did our tour with G Adventures who were fantastic!",April 2018,Lares Trek,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294317-d2386645-Reviews-Lares_Trek-Sacred_Valley_Cusco_Region.html,"Sacred Valley, Peru",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great Ruins,"This was a superb adventure through the Archaeological Park Ollantaytambo ruins. The views and the history keeps you engaged throughout the entire tour. I recommend taking at least half a morning to visit the site, there is so much to do anything less makes it very difficult and you'll be kicking yourself for not being able to do it.",April 2018,Archaeological Park Ollantaytambo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294319-d313942-Reviews-Archaeological_Park_Ollantaytambo-Ollantaytambo_Sacred_Valley_Cusco_Region.html,"Ollantaytambo, Peru",attractions,5.0,5.0
Pisac Ruins were great,"We visited the Pisac Ruins on a recent trip to Peru. Visiting the Pisac Ruins is a must, its only a short drive from Cusco, but it is recommended to go with a tour guide to get all the history of the site.

Great hotel and location,"Hotel Taypikala Cusco is a hidden gem, it is in a great location and the hotel itself is finished to a high standard.

Hidden gem in Lima,"We had a great stay at Antigua Miraflores Hotel in Lima. A perfect location for walking around Miraflores with easy access to archaeological sites, shops, restaurants and beach.

Could be a great hotel,"This could be a great hotel, but a series of unfortunate events lead me to rate this hotel down.

We booked an airport pickup via the hotel, however upon arrival our room was not ready and were required to wait 45 minutes, with no apology given nor any explanation about wifi or breakfast (when, where) etc.

Further, the hotel is right next door to a building site which is very noisy between 0730 and 1700 - it was not possible to change rooms and therefore it was difficult to rest (I was ill). This should have been discovered prior to booking.

The bar/restaurant only accepted cash and it is not possible to place the cost on to your room. We were caught out by this and had to go cash machine to pay - although frustratingly the waiter went downstairs to hotel reception to change the money.

The staff were friendly, rooms were of good quality and the hotel is ideally located.",April 2018,Mariel Hotel Boutique & Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294316-d456095-Reviews-Mariel_Hotel_Boutique_Apartments-Lima_Lima_Region.html,"Lima, Peru",hotels,3.0,4.5
Marvelous,"What can I say, from start to finish Astrid & Gaston was marvelous, the staff were friendly and knowledgeable, the food was delightful and the atmosphere is spine tingling good. It was great to see that all staff were allergy aware and very conscious about my allergies.

My only niggle, less is sometimes more, the portion sizes are very large, this is not a fine dining menu.",April 2018,Astrid & Gaston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d789991-Reviews-Astrid_Gaston-Lima_Lima_Region.html,"Lima, Peru",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Tourist trap,"This meets the definition of a tourist trap. The Train Cemetry is not maintained or looked after. Tourists are able to climb over every train, and generally damage the site. You can visit this site without any tour guide. Still, its impressive to see but it is difficult to get any great shots due to hundreds of tourists being there at all times.",April 2018,Train Cemetery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g317033-d2619013-Reviews-Train_Cemetery-Uyuni_Potosi_Department.html,"Uyuni, Bolivia",attractions,2.0,3.5
Safety first,"Overall Todo Turismo is safe and very easy to use. The coaches are brand new, but lack USB changing points which is a let down for a tourist bus. When you board you are given a hot meal and hot drink, for breakfast you get a sandwich and drink. The wifi is very intermittent and only worked on way. Further, the bus played the exact same film both ways, they could at least change it up a bit.",April 2018,Todo Turismo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294072-d10489027-Reviews-Todo_Turismo-La_Paz_La_Paz_Department.html,"La Paz, Bolivia",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great day but you need to be careful,"I am an experienced cyclist, and cycling the Death Road is no joke. It was one of the greatest rides I have ever done, but also on of the most challenging. You can serious hurt yourself if you not pay attention. Slow and steady wins the race (ride in this case).

Select a reputable company and you won't be disappointed. It was a great day with spectacular views , although its sobering to see so many memorials on the descent due to all the deaths.",April 2018,WMDR Yungas Road,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294072-d317364-Reviews-WMDR_Yungas_Road-La_Paz_La_Paz_Department.html,"La Paz, Bolivia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Awesome! Except the Tourist Sell,"Lets admit this straight away, this is a tourist trap where you will be pressured to buy items from the locals. However, it was an amazing experience, the islands truly are floating and the locals do live on the islands. We were lucky to be able to take a boat tour by the locals (you have ti pay for this), the boat is a full wicker boat and it was a great experience.

This is a unique experience that you do not want to miss.",April 2018,Uros Floating Islands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298442-d1584207-Reviews-Uros_Floating_Islands-Puno_Puno_Region.html,"Puno, Peru",attractions,4.0,4.0
Truly spectacular,"Tambopata Ecolodge is one of the best experiences of our entire trip to Peru. It takes about 3 hours to arrive at Tambopata Ecolodge via the river, but the views along the way are amazing, you may even get to spot some wildlife.

When you arrive at the lodges, they are all eco friendly with running hot water and flush toilets. There is electricity which runs during the night to enable to power devices. The lodge makes all food fresh and is sourced locally from a farmer. We had Hugo and Edwin as our guides, they were a true credit to the Ecolodge, they were knowledgeable, friendly and outgoing.

OK for a night,"This hostel is suitable for the night, however any long term stay I would recommend staying elsewhere. The rooms are furnished to a low quality, with the beds being uncomfortable and toilet/shower were dirty. The bedroom also had the strong odor of cigarette smoke which wasn't enjoyable to sleep in.

What this hostel has going for it is the fact it is located to the bus terminal.",April 2018,Hostal Bellavista,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294072-d7392056-Reviews-Hostal_Bellavista-La_Paz_La_Paz_Department.html,"La Paz, Bolivia",hotels,3.0,4.5
Uncomfortable stay,"We were advised when booking (Booking.com) that this hostel spoke English, however when we arrived the receptionist did not speak any English. Due to the language barrier the receptionist did try to overcharge us, thankfully I had a copy of our Booking.com reservation. While waiting for our room the receptionist passed us the telephone, it was a tour company attempting to sell us tours for our visit. This felt very pushy and made us feel very uncomfortable and pressured.

The rooms are OK and were clean, with the shower and toilet also both being clean. We heard staff throughout the night, they created a lot of noise.",April 2018,Hostal Inka Roots,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294313-d4309697-Reviews-Hostal_Inka_Roots-Arequipa_Arequipa_Region.html,"Arequipa, Peru",hotels,3.0,4.0

Where is the seasoning?,"I was very disappointed with my visit, while the staff were friendly the quality of the food was well below what I would have expected. The burger was dry and lacked any seasoning making it a very tasteless burger (I had the honest burger).
