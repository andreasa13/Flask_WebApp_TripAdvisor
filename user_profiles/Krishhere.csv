Beautiful Church,"Located on the main square of Oia, this church with spotless white walls, blue some and a bell tower with six bells is an iconic image of Santorini.

Excellent view & service,"We chose Imerovigli as the place to stay in Santorini, over Oia and Fira and zeroed in on Vista Mare suites, after reading a lot of reviews on tripadvisor. Glad we made that choice. Vista Mare is located at Gali square, the central point of Imerovigli. A few steps down from there takes you to the place. The view from our room was fantastic. It was a nice experience having breakfast sitting in the balcony, watching the caldera, the volcano and the boats on the sea. The room was clean and comfortable. Service was great with George there to take care of all our needs. There are nice restaurants nearby where you can have candle light dinner in the open. The bus stop is a short walk away from where buses connect to main points like Oia, Fira and Perivolos beach.",August 2019,Vista Mare Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d625551-Reviews-Vista_Mare_Suites-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0

Early morning ferry to Santorini,"We took a cab to go to the port to catch the World champion Jet Ferry to Santorini at 7.15 am. Reached here nearly an hour early.

Dangerous cliff - tourists ignore warning,"The walk to the beach down a steep slope alongside the cliff, is very slippery and dangerous. There is a warning sign warning tourists not to venture there due to frequent landslides. However, we found a lot of tourists including elderly people risking it. We went some way and turned back. So did many others. Not worth the risk. There is just a thin rope tied along the edge of the pathway. Just a rope ! That is not the level of safety you expect in an European country. Wonder why the Greece Tourism Department is allowing this. God forbid if a major landslide does happen, they may point to the warning sign and say 'didn't we warn you'.

Nice boat trip,We were staying at Imerovigl from where we had an excellent view of the caldera. We took a tour by boat to the volcano island. The best part was the boat ride through the blue waters of the Aegean sea. Some of the views were as if from picture post cards. We docked at the volcano island made of black rocks and our tour guide took the people on a hike of the volcano. A handful of us chose to stay back on the boat and enjoy the breeze and the scenery.

Avoid,"We went to Thirassia island as part of a one day tour to the volcanos, hot springs and oia. We landed at Thirassia around 1.30 pm and our tour guide recommended to all of us to have lunch at Labros. She said they serve the best sea food. Little did we realise that this was a set up. Labros is one of the five or six restaurants on the small rocky beach at Thirassia. First look itself was not very promising, but with most people on our tour headed there, prompted by the tour guide, we decided to try out the place. The sea food; we tried kalamari and some other fish, tasted bland with parts of it uncooked. Yuck ! There were cats roaming around the restaurant and eating leftovers. Yuck ! Surprised to find such a restaurant in Europe. Obviously, the tour guide is paid to direct tourists to them.

World Champion Jet Ferry from Athens to Santorini,"Was slightly apprehensive about the ferry after reading some negative reviews on trip advisor. But our trip went off without a hitch. Our ferry was at 7.15 am and we reached the port about 45 minutes early. First they allowed the cars and two wheelers in, on to the ground floor of the ferry. At around 7 am, they asked passengers to come on board. There are racks on the ground floor, to store bags. The names of various islands where the ferry stops are marked on the racks. Take care to store your bags in the right rack (note Santorini is called Thira) or it might get offloaded at another port of call. Seating is on the upper deck as per the seat number on the ticket. The staff on the ferry will direct you to the right seating spot. The seats are ok, not that comfortable. Snacks and drinks are available for purchase. The ferry took more time than expected. We reached Santorini by 2.15 pm, a hour behind schedule. Would rate the whole experience as functional ie meeting the need.

The symbol of Athens,"A few tips first. (1) Suggest you visit the Acropolis museum before visiting the Acropolis, to get a feel of the history of the ancient city. (2) Read up on the Acropolis online and download a map of the Acropolis on your mobile, before your visit. You don't need a tour guide. (3) if you are visiting Greece during summer like we did, keep in mind it is going to be very hot. Carry water and use sun cream. Proper walking shoes is a must since you have to climb stairs to reach the site. The climb is easy. No worries on that at all. (4) visit Acropolis in the evening, after 5.30 pm so that you can see the Parthenon lighted up. Also a good idea to escape the heat. (5) Buy a ticket online in advance, to beat the queue. Buy either a solo ticket or a combo ticket which covers Acropolis plus other historical sights of Athens

Symbol of Greece,"The Parthenon is probably the most famous tourist symbol of Athens. Suggest visiting the Acropolis in the evening as we get to see Parthenon lighted up.

Originally built as a temple of godess Athena, this structure subsequently underwent transformations due to conquest of Athens by invaders. Thus, it got convered to a christian church under Byzantine rule and later into a mosque after the Ottoman invasion. Later, parts of the Parthenon were broken and transported to the London museum.

Be extremely wary of marketing tricks,"If a tour guide recommends this place so that you get to see the local pottery making, keep in mind that is just a front and at the end of pottery making show, the people there will play tricks to put pressure on you to buy stuff, and that too costly ones.

As we walked in, we were seated and offered a welcome drink. Then, we witnessed pottery making using a spinning foot wheel. We were also shown the painting process and sample designs. We were then led to a large room where very costly pieces of ceramic ware were on display for sale. Keep on mind that they invite you to this room first and use their subtle selling skills to push you to buy some costly stuff promising 20% discount. If you show lack of interest they say 'let me try and help you' and then start reducing the price. Don't fall for it unless you really find something of interest. Otherwise just politely and firmly move on. In that case, they will take you to another room where the prices are lot lot cheaper. So, it is clear that they are doing it on purpose; show the costly items first and push you to buy them by offering discounts and if that doesn't work, show you the less costlier stuff.

Rating of 4 for the items on display, but overall rating of 3 considering the sales pitch / tricks ",August 2019,Kapadokya Seramik,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297981-d10619114-Reviews-Kapadokya_Seramik-Avanos_Cappadocia.html,"Avanos, Turkey",attractions,3.0,4.0

Not for talk people & those with breathlessness issues,"Before you go into the tunnel, you have to keep your mobile, camera and other belongings in a locker (no photography allowed inside the tunnel). You then wear a helmet and walk into the tunnel. It is a steep slope for the first half a kilometre. From there on the slope is very mild but the tunnel gets narrow both in terms of height and width. That section is not for people who are claustrophobic. Six footers will find it a problem in this section as they will have to stoop to avoid hitting their head against the top of the tunnel. So, I went only till the first half a kilometre and turned back. Majority of the tourists did so. The climb back was slow and we saw several people facing issues of breathlessness.

A must visit,"The DMZ is a buffer zone separating South and North Korea. The place is heavily fortified and at a check point, South Korean soldiers will stop your vehicle and check your passport. You can take a half day or a full day tour to DMZ from Seoul. I suggest the half day no shopping tour in the morning which takes you to all the places and gives you enough time to see each place, without wasting time on shopping.

The tour covers Imjingak Park where you can see the Freedom bridge and a locomotive riddled with more than 1,000 bullets, which serves as a grim reminder of the Korean war. You also get to see the 3rd infiltration tunnel built by North Koreans to try and infiltrate into South Korea. You can go down the sloping tunnel for some distance. After a while it gets cramped and head room is less for tall people (at anything point you can stop and come back). The next stop is the Dorasan observatory from where, using mounted binoculars, you can see North Korean military outpost and soldiers and a model village. The last stop is the Dorasan train station which is currently unused, and is a symbol of hope of the unification of the two Korea's.

During the time of our visit to Seoul, the JSA (panmunjeom) was closed for visitors. If it is open when you visit, don't miss it. Overall, the visit to DMZ was unique and a chilling reminder of the hostility between the two countries.",April 2019,DMZ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1872665-d2076201-Reviews-DMZ-Paju_Gyeonggi_do.html,"Paju, South Korea",attractions,4.0,4.5

These are well brought out by various sculptures on the lawns of the memorial. One very moving statue is is the 'Statue of brothers' where a South Korean Soldier hugs his younger brother who is serving in the North Korean army, on the battle field.
