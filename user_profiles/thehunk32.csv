Number one thing for Athens. Don’t miss it,"Definitely the most important sight of all.

One of the musts in Athens,Epic sight in the heart of Athens that is a must. Unfortunately it is not included in the 30 eur pass you buy for all the other sites but it’s 5 euros well spent to go there and see it.

Rooftop pool,"Awesome hotel with an amazing roof top pool and bar. Definitely one of the best views on Athens and the acropolis! I would say that’s a good reason to choose this hotel over any other.

True Italian food with authentic experience,"Guys, for real. I don’t usually write a review but I was so amazed by the kindness and thoughtfulness of the staff at this restaurant that I just had to take my time to write a review.
1, the Manager (Simone) walks around making sure everyone is happy with a big smile. Love the attitude and care for his customers. True gentlemen!
2, staff the same
3, food, just simply amazing. I recommend the cacio e pepe we especially liked that in company of a spicy salami pizza. In addition, they have a nice selection of wines (the Chianti recommended to us is now a personal favorite).

This is not the typical touristy restaurant, this is the true Italian experience where you are welcomed and treated with special kindness. And the food is outstanding!

PS: You can easily watch soccer games at the restaurant and this definitely adds to the experience!",June 2018,Il Tempio di Minerva,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1632970-Reviews-Il_Tempio_di_Minerva-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
best asian fast food in town. no joke!,"they make the food for you. so it is not the menza style when its already prepared and they heat it for you. it is quite frankly the best asian fast food in the city. fresh ingredients, great cooks, and nice people. only bad thing they got, the place is small. time to upgrade ;)",February 2018,Oishi Sushi Budapest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274887-d10510543-Reviews-Oishi_Sushi_Budapest-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Original Italian,"Great quality food with great prices. Loved the feel of this little place and how it wasnt the busy touristy style.

A day that i will never forget,"My friends and me had a great time in Budapest with Andras. The hidden treasure is a truly memorable, and fun trip to partake in. I have been to Budapest before, its a beautiful city, but it has so many cool places that only locals would know, and not necessary in the ""tour books"". If you are looking for something truly adventures and unique i definitely recommend this trip. We have gone to an island on the Danube (via a tiny boat :) ), to hidden 300 years old mysterious libraries downtown Budapest. And we even got to see Budapest from the top of a roof. Real unique experience, truly fantastic trip. Andras speaks real good English, he is very polite, knowledgable, loves Budapest, and seems to have lots of joy from showing us all around. Reliable, prepared, and funny.",May 2015,My Personal Budapest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274887-d1832890-Reviews-My_Personal_Budapest-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",attractions,5.0,5.0
