Monet and more,"Two great rooms with 8 panels of large format Monet water lilies paintings is worth the trip alone. But there's more... The museum is currently undergoing renovation, but two other exhibits are there now. One about spoons which I did not find too compelling. And then one about and art critic and collector that ranges from Seraut to more contemporary pieces and some African masks and objects. It was very interesting.",October 2019,Musee de l'Orangerie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d265635-Reviews-Musee_de_l_Orangerie-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing stained glass,"You can't believe it until you see it. The amount of stained glass on the second floor is unbelievable. I thought the first floor looked pretty good, but that was just for the commoners, the upstairs was for the palace goers.
But the combo ticket with the conciergerie to skip the line, because the line can be long.",October 2019,Sainte-Chapelle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d190202-Reviews-Sainte_Chapelle-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best Thai,"Took a chance and got there early and was able to get a table, as it books up. Great Thai food and not like others I've had. The fried chicken curry came as a piece of chicken breaded, fried nice and crispy and sliced on the plate with the curry sauce around to dip it in. Rice comes on the side. Steak again is served like a steak, thinly sliced on the plate with the hot and sweet sauce (it will make your eyes water hot). Also try the mashed sweet potatoes with coconut milk. Really smooth and tasty. Beer and wine prices reasonable too. I would definitely come back, soon!",October 2019,CHANG,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d12999049-Reviews-CHANG-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Definitely worth the hike,"Small monastery at the top of the hill. The hike took us 1 hour 15 minutes to go up, sign says it is 2.2 km and 1,500 foot elevation. It is partly a ""paved"" stone path, some parts are first and some are rocky with loose rocks. Best to wear hiking shoes. Bring water,although there is some at the top. We went I October and it was not that hot, but it was a pretty hard pull up and water was welcome.

Amazing artifacts,"This is a fantastic museum and has a lot of artifacts that are from the sites we visited who,e in Greece including the Acropolis and Mycenae and Olympia. We were there 2.5 hours but could have spent more time on the upper floor which I don't think most people go to. They even have a small Egyptian section. Definitely download the free Rick Steve's audio guide that takes you through the museum. I think it is best to see the sites and then the museum.",October 2019,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great site,"Of course you cannot come to Athens and not see the Acropolis It's a good hike up tot the site and lots of walking, but it is not to be missed.

Short on flavor and pours,"So this is just an ok Italian meal. We were looking for a break from Greek food so it sounded good. Started out with ordering a glass of wine which was the shortest pour I've seen. Not just us but others around us too I noticed. Then the pear Gorgonzola salad came. Had about 5 slivers of pear, hardly knew they were there and only a couple of walnuts. Clearly this place is skimping on provisions. The pizza was bland and soggy. We eat a lot of Italian food and this place is not up to par. Service was good I would have to add. So that is good.",October 2019,Cardinale,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d18218634-Reviews-Cardinale-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Great stay in the suite,"This is not a 5 star hotel but we had a 5 star stay in the suite that has a balcony with a view of the harbor. This was a quaint 8 room hotel with a nice breakfast, served from 9-11am. We had a very relaxing stay with great access to town, hiking and the beaches. It is a bit of a stair climb up to the hotel, we had the donkey take our luggage up and down, and got a lot of exercise going up and down to town, but we did not mind the exercise. The staff was so attentive and even helped us get some laundry done after a week on the road. Room was clean and spacious for European standard. We really liked the extra space of having the suite and feeling like we could relax on the balcony. We noticed very few hotels here had balconies. If you go, please feed ""Blackie"" the little kitty that hangs out below the balcony for me.

Loved it,"Great service, not rushed. We just wanted to sit and enjoy the view of the Acropolis and our food and drinks. I thought the prices were reasonable and the food very good. The Saganaki was great, my first time having it, but since others had recommended it thought we'd try it. Also, had the Sea Bream, which I also had never had before but seemed to be a local speciality so thought I'd better try that too. It was very flaky and moist without a strong fishy flavor. Watch out for a few bones. The accompanying steamed veggies were very bland and over cooked, but having had a salad also I did not care much for the extra veggies. They should sauté them in a little herbs and butter or something because the fish was so good.
I would definitely recommend dining here.",October 2019,Attalos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2075424-Reviews-Attalos-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Lovely outdoor dining,"We came here because the previous night after we had already eaten dinner we walked by and it was really hopping. Menu is large and varied.
I have had my fill of traditional Greek food so was happy to see the diversity of the food.
The seasonal salad was very fresh but the dressing was a little bland. Grilled pork was good and spaghetti hit the spot.
The outdoor setting was lovely and several cats let us know they thought the food here was good too.
Service was prompt and prices good.",October 2019,Xeri Elia Douskos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1189165-d1892919-Reviews-Xeri_Elia_Douskos-Hydra_Town_Hydra_Saronic_Gulf_Islands_Attica.html,"Hydra, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Ok place on a quiet square,"Good Souvlaki and Greek salad.
I felt like he was trying to push me into getting the fresh fish which was €49 per kilo but he couldn't tell me how much they were going to serve me and I clearly didn't want a kilo worth of fish and then it didn't come with anything so it was very confusing.
But we split the salad and the grilled meat and that seem to be plenty and was tasty",October 2019,Annita's Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1189165-d3709152-Reviews-Annita_s_Taverna-Hydra_Town_Hydra_Saronic_Gulf_Islands_Attica.html,"Hydra, Greece",restaurants,3.0,3.5

Great gyros and hummus,"Note there is a picture of a red onion on the sign. The name is not obvious. Stopped her based on Rick Steves book. Had the chicken gyros and a side of hummus.

Fantastic 4 day tour!,"We took the four day Argolis, Nafplio, Olympia, Delphi tour. Our driver was Alex and he was fantastic!
It was so stress-free to have the driver pick us up at our hotel in Athens and then take us to the sites. Although Alex is not a tour guide per se, he knows a lot about all the sites and he would tell us about them before we got to them. Also he would let us know where we should go in for each site and then where he would be picking us up; and he would be waiting for us and told us no worries, take as much time as you like in each site. Alex also customized the trip for us letting us know that if we wanted to stop to take any pictures or take a side road instead of the highway that was possible. He also fit in a little wine tasting at a winery along the way, and a forest that had 1000s year old olive trees.
We stopped at small villages along the way for lunch or a coffee or just a walk around to stretch our legs after being in the car. He drove us in a very nice Mercedes-Benz that was very comfortable and had plenty of room in the trunk for our two large suitcases. The company picked the hotels for us and they were all quite nice or in a good part of town depending on the area.
Alex was kind enough to take photos of us too, many times we come home with only a few bad selfies of the two of us.
Since Alex is from the area he was also able to explain a lot of local customs and issues as well as history to us. It was like having a friend who lives here drive you around. I've never hired a driver before, and I thought that potentially this was a bit extravagant, but it was a great way to see the country with someone who knew where they were going so I didn't have to navigate or get in an argument with my husband about which way to go on the road.
During the entire trip Alex was always cheerful and upbeat, responsible, and focused on making sure we had a great time!We can't recommend Alex and Georges taxi highly enough. I would definitely take another trip with him next time I am in Greece.",October 2019,George's Taxi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1905851-Reviews-George_s_Taxi-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

Beautiful sunset view,"Although I felt they were really pushing the seafood that was fresh but very expensive like lobster for €120 per kilo. But I enjoyed the seafood salad and my husband had the pork that was grilled it was quite good. We also had cheese appetizer and some House wine.

The bomb!,Needing a change of pace from Greek food we saw this Indian restaurant was highly recommended and so we took a chance. Everything was fabulous. In fact a small tour group from India was in the restaurant at the time that we were eating.

Good stop for birds and stretch your legs,"We stopped for the birds, but we were there mid-day so that it is not the best time to find birds, but there is a nice walk to a bird tower that you can climb the stairs for a good view of the area. We did see an osprey and some pelicans. Also saw a green snake (Rough Greensnake) on the path (harmless). There is a small visitor center with a nice display of birds and a viewing window. Also a neat gift shop with some cool, affordable swag. Check it out.

Hidden Gem,"Free museum, but please leave a donation. They have some great pictures and artifacts from ship wrecks and pirates. Some neat films to watch about recovery efforts.

Pack a picinc,"We stopped here to get some lunch to take on our drive down to Cape Hatteras, and I am glad we did as there is not a lot along the way until you get down there, so we stopped at a park along the way and ate our sandwiches.

Allow 2 hours,"If you want to see the whole thing and walk the site, allow 2 hours. This is a national park so you need a park pass or pay $10 per person, but then you can have access for 7 days to the site. But I can't imagine that you would need to come back unless you only have time for part of it one day and complete it on another. The museum is newly re-done and well curated. It explains the process of how the wright brothers came to develop the first flying machine and their trial and errors, even how they changed the current thinking about some formulas that were thought to be certain. Then walk up to the hill where they first practiced with gliders. There are posts showing how far the first 4 attempts flew. And there is a model of the first plane that is a statue in full size which you imagine yourself flying on. It doesn't take long to tour the whole site, but it is pretty amazing to see.",September 2019,Wright Brothers National Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g49256-d108046-Reviews-Wright_Brothers_National_Memorial-Kill_Devil_Hills_Outer_Banks_North_Carolina.html,"Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great location at a good price,"We stayed using our points from Marriott Bonvoy, but the prices were good here. The hotel just opened and is a short walk across the street to beach access. It is only about 1-2 miles from Kitty Hawk National Park which was the reason for our visit. The hotel is of course really clean and nicely decorated since it is new. Staff were efficient and the breakfast was plentiful and good for a free breakfast. Had some healthy choices like fruit and turkey sausage (ok healthier than some things) but they also had the traditional eggs and waffles, etc. Small pool and no hot tub, but work out facility was decent. It is off the main drag, but walking distance to a really good restaurant, Kill Devil Grill a must try. Plenty of free parking too.

Quiet get away with fabulous food,"Small restaurant so reservations are necessary on most nights. They do have a bar so maybe you can get a seat at the bar faster. They also have an outdoor patio that allows dogs. Food was very good, fish was fresh. Wait staff was very efficient and amiable. We would definitely recommend this place.

"Go early, long waits","The special on this day was tuna and it was fantastic, also the ribs and chicken, which my husband ordered was on the special board, but he was not a fan, he felt that the ribs were cooked too quickly and were not tender. But this seems to really be a place to order the fish as it is so fresh here. We met a local customer while waiting at the bar and she advised to get the specials as they are usually awesome. So I think that's true of the fish. The wait was about 30 minutes on a Thursday night, they don't take reservations and there were a lot of people waiting, so I thought it might take longer. I would definitely come back.",September 2019,Kill Devil Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49256-d414376-Reviews-Kill_Devil_Grill-Kill_Devil_Hills_Outer_Banks_North_Carolina.html,"Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Great location to walk to lots of restaurants and music venues.
My room was so small I thought I was in Europe, it seemed like they had taken a couple feet away to make a suite in the next room, because in the hall you could tell that the next room was large and in fact there was a room number missing in the sequence.

Great Lunch spot,"Good hearty sandwiches and large salads. Sweet potato fries were awesome! Of course, I am addicted to them and consider myself an expert on them too. They serve Splash clam chowder which is known to be excellent. Nice outdoor seating area on the patio. You order at the counter and they bring it out to your table. Takes a little while to make them as they are made to order. If you are in a hurry call in for take out. I thought the sandwiches were very very good, but I could only eat half (probably because of the fries- oh well) and had the other half for lunch the next day, so if you are not super hungry you might want to split a sandwich. This is a new place that took the place of Alphy's and the menu is similar in some ways.",April 2019,Sidewalk Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29111-d17335243-Reviews-Sidewalk_Cafe-Arroyo_Grande_San_Luis_Obispo_County_California.html,"Arroyo Grande, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Interesting that the person that suggested it was at the information center in town. You would think they would know this. Keep an eye out for highway patrol, they are everywhere.

Music and food,"I some how erased my review, so I can't recall the details of my visit but we ate at several places on the island including some highly rated ones and found them to be really touristy with the food and service being mediocre, so this place really stood out as excellent in comparison.

Old School,Nice meal at an old style restaurant with some high booths and other open seating at tables. We sat at one of the tables and it was very loud and noisy. Not a place for a quiet dinner but maybe the booths would be better. I would say most of the food was good to average. Salad was uninspiring. Cilantro dressing was good and nicely spicy. Steak was done exactly as ordered. Pasta dishes provided a lot of food. Definitely a good value for the money. Mashed potatoes and scalloped potatoes were OK but nothing special. Overall I would definitely come back and try some other things on the menu.,February 2019,The Swiss Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33051-d370706-Reviews-The_Swiss_Restaurant-Santa_Maria_California.html,"Santa Maria, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5

OMG Real BBQ,"I am a self described BBQ expert chowing down in Texas, the Carolinas, Kansas City and Chicago to name a few. There is no other place like this on the central coast. This is real Texas style BBQ, right down to get there before they run out. In Austin, TX people line up in the morning because they know real BBQ places make it fresh everyday and when they run out that day, there is no more. So people might complain if the place is closed because they ran out of meat, to that I say, learn to act like a Texan and get there early. OK now that you are there, be prepared for some super BBQ. It is rare to find a place that does everything right but so far, I can't find a flaw. The mac and cheese is down home creamy without any frilly crumbs on top (amen to that) and the pulled pork and brisket done to perfection. Real BBQ one sweet and one spicy sauce not 5 different flavors that some places make to mask the meat. What else can I say the potato salad, coleslaw and beans are all spot on. Can't go wrong. Lots of food too for the price. And Friendly Folks! Order at the counter and walk the line to pick your sides.

Hotel on Airport Property,"Very convenient for me to stay at airport. Sometimes when you are doing a quick in and out travel for business this is very helpful. Be aware that hotel is located off of Terminal A the signage in the airport is non existent and I asked 5 people for directions most of whom gave me inaccurate information. But once you find it, it is only a 5 minute walk which I preferred after sitting on an airplane for many hours.
Hotel rooms do not have USB ports only electrical plugs. My charger was smashed on the airplane by a seat mate as she got up to the bathroom so I was with out a charger. Luckily the hotel loaned me one, but I am so used to the rooms now having USBs that you can plug into that I assumed that would be the case.

Unique spa experience,"Went by myself as my husband was not interested so it was a little weird just hanging out solo with hundreds of other people in huge hot tubs.
I love hot tubs but 38degrees didn’t seem hot enough for me. They keep most of the pools at varies temps mostly 34,36, and 38. I did not go in the cool baths or pools. The place is huge and I got lost several times. I also got a 45 minutes massage it was not like those in the US. You lay on your stomach only and the therapist mostly rubbed versus kneading maybe I could have told him but he spoke very little English and I only knew how to say Thanks in Hungarian. He also kept breathing heavily and snorting like he had a breathing problem. But all that being said it was still relaxing. It was supposed to be aromatherapy but I didn’t smell anything. Next day I had a pretty uncomfortable GI upset but not sure if it was from this spa or something I ate. I’ll never know. Still an interesting place and unique experience",September 2018,Széchenyi Baths and Pool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274887-d279029-Reviews-Szechenyi_Baths_and_Pool-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great service,Our first time flying Turkish Airlines and I was a little leery because the flight was cheaper than other airlines. But service was great and food was good for airline and lots of it. I wouldn’t hesitate to fly them again. Also they offer a free hotel night in instanbul with a layover which we would have done but we did not know about it until we boarded.

Great value,"I would give the hosts 5 stars. They were super when there was some confusion about our reservation but they worked it out to our satisfaction. The apartment is very large and quite adequate for our stay. However, bed is very firm, refrigerator is barely cold, Internet is extremely slow. Apartment was very clean however rustic. Bring your own shampoo. They do provide adequate dishes, instant coffee and tea, wood fired cooking stove and hot plate and hot pot. Friendly dog on premises. Easy walk to town and restaurants and pubs and museums. Plenty of parking for your car. Access to Mausoleum about 1 Hour Drive and lake Skadar about 90 minute drive
In town history museum worth a one hour visit.",September 2018,Casa Calda Apartment,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304076-d8130925-Reviews-Casa_Calda_Apartment-Cetinje.html,"Cetinje, Montenegro",hotels,3.0,4.5
Unique monestary,"About 1 hour drive from Podgorica. Road is well-maintained and easy to drive, for Montenegrin standards. Suggest that you not park at the lower church but drive up to the second parking lot which probably holds 100 cars. And there is handicapped parking even closer if you need it or have a stroller. There is a WC at each parking lot. From the upper parking lot it is about a 10 minute walk up many staircases to reach the monastery. The monastery is unique in the sense that it is built into a sheer rock face. The monastery is small but features multiple mosaics but what should not be missed is the room with the relic (skeleton) and it has some original frescoes on the wall that are quite well preserved. Of course there is a nice large gift shop where you can purchase swag.

Worth the hike up 461 steps,After you drive up the hill park on the right-hand side of the street where you see other people parking. They are only about 10 parking spots at the actual starting point up top so likely you will have to walk some up the street. It is two euros to drive up the street. And then after you climb the 461 steps it’s three euros more if you want to go into the Mauzoleum and see the statue and the actual tomb. But it’s worth it because you get to walk behind the structure and onto a little round balcony that allows for a fabulous 360° view.

Traditional meal,"Had a great dinner here. Option to sit inside or outside. Waiter very helpful in choosing menu items. Greek salad was small but enough as a starter. Some entrees are very large including the traditional pork dish. Steak dish seemed a usual size that you would get elsewhere. Menu says roasted pork and it is, but they should mention it is stuffed with cheese and ham. Very filling. I could eat less than half of it. There will be some happy kitties in town.

Nice visit and location,"This hotel is located about a 10 minutes walk out of the main old city. It is no problem to walk to old town from here on the promenade. Very pleasant. There are two nice restaurants on the water that are only a few minutes walk. Free parking right in front of hotel if you have a car. The view of the bay from our room and balcony was lovely. Room was adequate size. They could use some new pillows as they were flat and bed was a little too firm for but for a couple nights it was ok. The breakfast was varied and plentiful. It included yogurt, bread, fruit, walnut pastry (yum), two hot items that were different each day(crepe, cheesy ham toast, cheese topped aubergine, for example), coffee, tea, water and orange juice. The family could not have been nicer and more helpful. English spoken by some.

Fun to explore,"We bought the Herceg Novi Card for 5euros and then toured the two fortresses and the city museum. Which saved us 2 euros per person. You can get the card at the tourist information desk. First fortress we went to, Kanli Kula, the ticket person had never heard of the card and was going to make us pay again. But finally she let us in. Second fortress,Forte Mare, they seemed hesitant but accepted the card. At museum no problem. So I think the card or the ticket people are new. Anyway nice old town with shops and restaurants to explore. Check out the locally made souvenirs behind Saint Jerome’s church. Super nice owners and their daughter hand paints some of the items.

Interesting but not a must see,"We drove there but it is possible to walk from town, but we had just spent most of the day going up and down the streets of Herceg Novi, so needed a break. There is a parking lot with ample parking. Two churches are right next to each other. One has very old fresco like paintings covering the walls. The other more modern with interesting icons and metal ceiling hanging. Both were open with no one in there and no one stopping us to tell us to wear anything special.
The third church is up a wooded staircase path but that church was locked. Great view from up there but got several mosquito bites along the way.
The is a store on the level of the first two churches they sell religious items and wine. But no wine tasting, we were told tasting is only from 10 am to 1pm. We were there at 4:30pm
There is no explanation in any language of any history of the churches.",September 2018,Monastery Savina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304080-d600408-Reviews-Monastery_Savina-Herceg_Novi_Herceg_Novi_Municipality.html,"Herceg-Novi, Montenegro",attractions,3.0,4.5
DisneyLand Fish House,"Don't get me wrong this is a very good place, fish was super fresh and tasty. But it was a little overwhelming like Disneyland. Very busy. Everyone we know recommended we eat here when in Maui. We were not able to get a reservation so we sat at the bar (which has tables not just at a bar per se). The wait staff was so slow that we really felt like we were an afterthought. I know this is Hawaii and things are slower place, I get that, but it would be nice to get something to drink. It seems that they know that everyone will come here because of who they are and the reputation they have, so I think the service is lacking. Of course, as expected it was pricey ($58 for a fish dinner, $20 for soup for example). The food is super good, but I have had really good meals at other locations on the island too. So not sure I would come back and deal with the wait and the poor service. The grounds are beautiful and very Hawaiian so a beautiful setting. Note the restaurant is open to the air and there is no air conditioning so be prepared to sweat (another reason for wanting to get drinks in a timely manner).",July 2018,Mama's Fish House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60636-d479164-Reviews-Mama_s_Fish_House-Paia_Maui_Hawaii.html,"Maui, Hawaii",restaurants,4.0,4.5
on time,"Being on time is so important to me. All went smoothly, except the guy sitting in front of me spilled his beer and it flowed under the seat in front of me and completely soaked the inside of my bag. All my papers for my meeting were soaked. He was embarrassed but did apologize or offer to have it cleaned and the flight attendant basically said not her problem. So I thought that was a little odd.
