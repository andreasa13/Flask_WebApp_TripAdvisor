Warm welcome,"We decided to walk the lower paths below Knaresborough and booked lunch at the pub. Phoned a couple of days before and got an amazing response. Friendly, helpful and efficient. Even offered to reserve a car parking space for us!
We walked and the went for lunch on a Friday. What a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere immediately as you step into the place. Staff are welcoming and relaxed. Lighting is low and atmospheric and dogs are welcome. The beer was good and the food excellent. Mussels, sausages with black pudding, plus king prawns all went down a treat. What a fantastic place this is. Highly recommended!",October 2020,Mother Shipton Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g504004-d8492986-Reviews-Mother_Shipton_Inn-Knaresborough_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Knaresborough, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Relaxed quality,"We had vouchers for steak and wine here, so booked for 2 couples. It was well-represented, relaxed and informal and we were very well looked after by Lucas. His bubbly, enthusiastic manner was welcoming without being overbearing. The whole evening was beautifully paced and thoroughly enjoyable. We all opted for steak with peppercorn sauce and a mixture of sides. All perfectly cooked and presented. Recommendations for pudding were accepted and the quality was excellent. It didn't matter one bit about the slight lack of atmosphere. We will be back!",October 2020,Propeller Bar & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1645976-d17168952-Reviews-Propeller_Bar_Grill-Kirmington_Lincolnshire_England.html,"Kirmington, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fantastic again!,"Amid fears of lockdown, we managed to book a table for last night.
We again enjoyed a fabulous 7-course tasting menu meal in relaxed surroundings. The place was quite busy and we were seated at appropriate distances from other diners and had a truly enjoyable eating experience.
Each course provided amazing variations of texture, taste and aesthetic appeal. I marvel at the skill of the chefs and what consistently excellent food comes out of the kitchen.
It is so sad that they have been forced to close down for the foreseeable future. We would like to thank the staff and look forward to public places re-opening.",March 2020,Advocate Arms Hotel Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1096411-d2056534-Reviews-Advocate_Arms_Hotel_Restaurant-Market_Rasen_Lincolnshire_England.html,"Market Rasen, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Impressive hilltop,Something that we really wanted to see on our trip to Athens. A great time of year to visit without high temperatures and huge crowds.

One night in Bangkok!,"We stayed here for a transit stop-overs as it is close to the airport.
It is a fairly short taxi ride from the International airport and did the job.
We had two rooms with TV, aircon, large beds, fridge and decent bathroom and it felt safe and secure. A bit off the beaten path, you need a map or the phone number of the place handy, just in case the driver can't find it! You can get a shuttle through BA Apartments, so that is what I would recommend. They are very good.
The reception desk lady and the driver could not have been nicer and were not in your face either.
We arrived late and left early, but it was fine for our needs and fitted the bill perfectly.",August 2019,Ba Apartment Flow Suvarnabhumi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g667499-d18189424-Reviews-Ba_Apartment_Flow_Suvarnabhumi-Racha_Thewa_Samut_Prakan_Province.html,"Racha Thewa, Thailand",hotels,5.0,5.0
Caught it on a bad day?,"We saw the reviews, fancied a stroll for tasty Indian food and that's what we got.
However, we walked in to a right mess, baskets of bowls and plates littered the floor and there was nobody in there apart from two Grab drivers, presumably doing take away deliveries.
We were seated and attended to. We really only wanted a couple of dishes and lots of garlic naan so that's what we ordered along with drinks and poppadoms.However, the waiter returned shortly and explained that there was no garlic naan, not any maan actually and very few of the othet bread options were available. Out of all tje bread options, there were only 5 options, so we made do, rather reluctantly.
Beer and Sprite came quickly, Diet Coke took another 10 minutes and then Lemon juice some time after that.
We had ordered popodums, but the chicken dish arrived first! What Indian restaurant would do that? The chicken dish sat there for 10 minutes untouched, because we wanted bread with it!
Meanwhile popudoms arrived and were devoured long before the next main dish arrived. Still no breads!
The second dish arrived and eventually the bread arrived, but all too random and unconnected. It really spoilt the meal, plus the fact that it was fairly empty.
Quality was great, really tasty and flavoursome. Price-wise, a little on the expensive side for what we got.
Would I go back?? No.",August 2019,Shanti Indian Cuisine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293925-d15239535-Reviews-Shanti_Indian_Cuisine-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",restaurants,2.0,5.0
Great beach - until dusk!,"We stayed a couple of streets back from the beach and saw it early morning, mid day and early evening. What a contrast!
During the day, it is a long, deep, beautiful stretch of beach. Parasol shade and chairs are available for a small fee near the promenade, where there are also drinks and snacks for sale and toilets.
The sea is clean and safe, being only a gradual slope as you walk to get deeper.
The problem is that when the sun starts to fall, the whole world and his dog comes out to the beach in the late afternoon cool.
The high rise buildings shade massive areas of the beach, where hundreds of people congregate to play in the waves and sand. It's manic.

Late lunch,"Found this place very close to our Homestay and decided to give it a go. The place is quite small, with roof fans and clean, wooden tables. The menu is very limited, but what they do, they do very well. A menu shows accurate photos but there isn't much English spoken.
Great noodle dishes with a range of veg and meat and seafood.
I might have gone 5 star, but we ordered 4 noodle dishes, 2 dry and 2 soup, but we got 3 soups. Minor detail.

Excellent in every respect,"We stayed 3 nights in Danang at the end of our trip and it was well worth the little extra that we paid.
Large reception area with excellent, helpful receptionists and doormen, comfortable restaurant with loads of choice and good quality buffet breakfasts.
Room was large with two huge double beds, mini bar, safe, great quality bathroom and spotlessly clean and modern.
Rooftop pool and bar area with super (if restricted) views out over the beach and sea. Prices are reasonable and we had the pool area to ourselves for a lot of our time there.
Location was really good, just a couple of streets back from the main promenade and plenty of eating options.
Could not have been more pleased.

Family late-lunch,"Seven of us went in search of this place, mid-afternoon and found the place down a lovely, quiet street and it was empty.
That didn't deter us as we were hungry and had read the reviews.
They brought tables and chairs down to street level and we all sat and had a good feed and were well-watered!
Attention was swift and drinks came quickly, food was ordered and took quite a while, but this wasn't a problem, because almost all the food came together, compared with other places where dishes have appeared randomly and at irregular intervals. We ordered a variety of burgers and a chicken/pasta dish, plus two fish dishes. All were very generous potions and the burgers were 'double' thickness, well seasoned and well- cooked with appropriate fillings (cheese, salad, bacon etc).
The fish dishes were battered parcels, but very tasty and loads of food. We had a good go at eating everything and almost made it! Drinks were cold and reasonably priced.
All-in-all a very satisfying experience. Would recommend.",August 2019,Tam’s Pub and Surf Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298085-d3859606-Reviews-Tam_s_Pub_and_Surf_Shop-Da_Nang.html,"Da Nang, Vietnam",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Perfect easy eating,"We rolled up on a rainy night at about mid-evening and stood at the door as the place was full. The main guy beckoned us in and directed us upstairs and then kindly directed me to the nearest ATM. We sat and ordered from a large choice of meals and opted for chicken in clay pot, chicken lemongrass, chicken with fried morning glory and a hot-pot for 2!
The food arrived quickly and was excellent quality. The sauce on the morning glory was the tastiest we have had. The chicken in clay pot was succulent, moist and fabulous. The hot-pot was huge and took some eating, with great quality beef the star of the show.
Beers and other drinks were cheap and all delivered in a quiet, unassuming manner by the waitresses.
We were pleased with the bill and absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal.

It was quite dark and dingy inside but the decor was pleasing and comfortable.
We had beers and cocktails, plus hot red wine, which was a pleasant surprise on a cool, rainy day.

Early evening meal,"An ideal food stop opposite the pub! After a couple of drinks we stopped here for a family meal.
A very open cafe-feeling restaurant with no frills, but very good food. The menu has lots of choice with a range of drinks and food available. We considered lots of options and then saw the special offer. There are set menu options with a drink, soup + bread, sizzling hot plate of meat (choice of chicken, fish, beef or pork) with plain rice plus a banana chocolate crepe. This all for around 100k.
An easy choice for the adults, while the teenagers opted for pizza.

Pizza night,"We decided to have a pizza night on our last night here.
We were impressed with the main waiter whose English is very good - it seems there are sister restaurants in other parts of the country, some pizza and some Vietnamese.
They have a wood-fired pizza oven and pizza is made from fresh dough so you can watch. The food came very quickly and the pizzas were very good, thin and crispy with good toppings. The salads were a disappointment as there wasn't enough avocado and the chicken Caesar salad wasn't great and the chicken wasn't great quality. Pesto bread was tasty, but prices are a bit above local prices.",August 2019,Napoli Pizza - Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g737051-d17783200-Reviews-Napoli_Pizza_Cafe-Cat_Ba.html,"Cat Ba, Vietnam",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Brunch or any meal!,"We saw this place as we walked along the front a few times. Eventually stopped to view the menu and a guy with a huge smile invited us in. How could we resist?
We were on a late breakfast/early lunch timescale, so some opted for omelette and some for baguette sandwiches and we were all pleased with our food.
The cheese, ham and veg omelette was the best I have tasted in 2 weeks in Vietnam and the baguettes were good-sized, nicely filled and very tasty.
Drinks variety is huge and reasonably priced and the whole meal for 4 came out at less than £12.
Very pleased and it is as good as anything around in Cat Ba.

Rainy day brunch,"This place didn't appear straight away when I searched, but I am glad we found it. On a rainy morning, we wanted somewhere close to our hotel so we went here late morning.
It looks only like a hotel from the street, but once inside we were directed up to the roof and found a quaint little garden rooftop with covered and open seating.
The menu is in English and very clear. A good range of food and drink at very good value. Portions are large and food quality is very good. We ate a version of the Thai soup TomYum (chicken), Pad Thai, BBQ chicken and fried squid with satay sauce. The blended ice coffee was also excellent and great value for money.
The staff were very friendly. Food takes a little time, but we were not in a rush.

Evening meal,"We saw the reviews and decided to give it a go early evening. We were the first there, so had the choice of seats. We ordered drinks which arrived very quickly, the milkshake a little longer. Good beer and Mojito.
The food arrived and we were not disappointed by pesto pasta and burger. Also really tasty was the chicken lemongrass. However, the most amazing was the braised pork in coconut, which was so tasty and succulent.
Dessert was a tasty crepe and 4 of us shared 2, as we were very full.
Waitresses were excellent and all in all it was a successful meal. The attention to detail with the food was matched by the internal decor.

It was a 15 minute walk which looked like leading us to a little backwater, but we soon found the place and were seated quickly at a street table. The place was busy and people were having to wait, but seemed content to have a drink at the bar. The cocktail barman was a superb showman too.

Again, we were very pleased with everything - the food quality, the quantity, the service and the price.
We ate squid, eel, frog legs, chicken, octopus, morning glory, pak choi, lots of rice plus beers and soft drinks.

5-course tasting menu,"Every so often, we eat here and sample the tasting menu when there is an offer on, or whenever we have a special occasion. We recently went here as a couple, to dine on a Thursday evening. The place is bright and airy, with clean lines and a comfortable feel. Staff are professional and attentive, without being overly fussy. They are well-trained and efficient, with attention to detail and a 'can-do' attitude.
The food is always of a very high standard and always slightly surprising in character - different slants on traditional foods, which make dining a very interesting and exciting experience at times, with flavoursome combinations.

Outstanding,"This place deserves more than 5 stars, because for the price you pay, it is outstanding. From off the street it is a humble, unassuming place with glass doors leading to a reception area. When you get to your room, it is amazing. Spacious, airy and well decorated, our family room had a large double bed and 2 singles, each with their own room equipped with TV and air con. Windows are double glazed keeping the noise of the street to a distant hum. The staff could not be more welcoming, friendly, helpful and accommodating. Fluent English is spoken by the people in reception and nothing is too much trouble - from assisting you with tours, changing large denomination notes and buying (and cutting up) fresh pineapple for you, to organising airport transfers, turning down the beds at night, delivering foot-baths each evening and doing your laundry!

Buzzing with locals,"After reading the reviews, we had to give this place a try as it is just 2 minutes walk from our hotel. It is just as described. A vibrant, busy, bustling restaurant filled with local people obviously enjoying themselves. Prices are really good and the range of different foods is amazing. We tried a variety, opting for crispy squid, chicken and noodles, garlic snails and spicy prawns and steamed rice, washed down with soft drinks and beers. All tasty and good quality and large potions of everything.

Pleasant visit,"We read about this place and contacted them through Facebook to book a table aiming to see sunset. This happens around 18:20 at the moment so we got there at 18:00 ish and were promptly seen to a table. There is a range of cocktails and other drinks including craft beers and imported lagers but the prices are appreciably higher than street level in the same vicinity.

Cosy and welcoming,"We read the reviews and went each day we were there (four days). On the 4th day, it was just too busy and Peter reluctantly couldn't accommodate us, but we understood. The place is small but that's part of the appeal. The other appeal is the excellent food and affordable drinks. the garlic potato was divine, the garlic bread rolls excellent, the pizza superb, the spinach and cheese dish delicious. An open fire greeted us on every occasion, alongside a genuine warmth from the staff. Even when tables were 'booked', they attempted to fit people in, even for a short stay.

Friendly and good value,"The number of options on this area is absolutely bewildering and it is difficult to choose unless you have a clear idea what you want. We didn't want American, Italian or Mexican so we opted for this place with clear menus and photos with reasonable prices. We weren't disappointed. The service was friendly and fast with plenty of staff. The place was busy, but everywhere was! We had a range of well-cooked, tasty food and a couple of rounds of drinks for less than $40.

Awesome,"Visiting in the 25th anniversary year of it being a World Heritage Site, we were prepared to be impressed by Angkor Wat and surrounding temples, but we were unprepared for the extent of the area covered. Our hotel provided us with a driver for $25 and we left at 04:30 to be there for sunrise. There is a detour en route, to buy tickets and everyone with the same idea congregated at the rows of ticket counters to purchase ticks for one day ($37) or longer. Don't join the wrong queue! It's easy to do, as you are half asleep and it's not quite as obvious as you would like. Anyway, the complex is another short ride north where you show your tickets and gain entry. Angkor Wat is most people's first port of call and is impressive from the front, but even more impressive once you get in and explore. You could easily take 2 hours here.
Next on the 'mini tour' route is an even larger collection of temples with a clearly signposted route for you negotiate the maze of structures. Again, the scale is vast. Bring plenty of water, sun protection and strong legs - the walking is reasonably challenging at times. More temples are dotted across an even more vast area and can be visited on the short route and we spent 6 hours doing just that! The hotel suggested it might even take us 9. Anything longer than 6 hours with teenage daughters is (I would suggest) for the hardened historian and temple addict. Great experience and awe inspiring.",August 2018,Angkor Wat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d317907-Reviews-Angkor_Wat-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Hugely impressive,"Even larger than it's more famous neighbour, this can be accessed on the same tour as Angkor Wat and provides an even larger area for exploration and photo opportunity. There is a clear route via which to walk through the myriad of temple buildings and you are encouraged to walk in, up and around all of the buildings - which is refreshing I think. There are some 'no-go' areas but on the whole it is all very accessible if you are reasonably fit and determined.

Another fascinating temple,"To be honest, we were almost ""templed out"" by the time we made it to Ta Prohm as we had spent the best part of 6 hours doing the rounds of the more famous temples earlier in the tour.

Good food at good prices,"We went here after looking at some reviews and were not disappointed. We found the place just off the main drag past Beer Street and were seated in the already-busy restaurant. Orders were taken and the main fella was brilliant with sorting everyone out. Food came at different times as-and-when it was ready and the chicken breast took a long time to arrive, but when it did ....... wow, it was worth the wait.

Mayhem madness!,"Coming to Cambodia, we had expected things to be a little less manic than Bangkok and Vietnam but this place is absolutely buzzing. We wandered around on a Friday night and it had the feel of a night market with roads becoming pedestrian areas and bars and restaurants all competing for business. Pub Street is lively, loud, busy, vibrant and eclectic in terms of food outlets. I didn't really like it to start with but it soon grew on me and even though many places are very over-priced, you can still find reasonably priced restaurants where you can sit and people-watch and enjoy the vibe.

Historic and interesting,"We took a private car here - no need to book a tour if your English is OK. It takes about an hour from Hoi An by taxi. We arrived at the gates to buy a ticket which is 150000 VND and from there you take a short walk to the museum and past there 2 minutes to the electric buggies which transport you for 5 mins further up the valley to the second stage. Here you get out and walk the trail to the temple ruins usually in a clockwise direction. However, we went anticlockwise to get to the Cham dancing performance which was due to start in 30mins, so we made the shortest route. The dancing was fun and interesting with some live music. Then we walked the ancient ruins. There are information boards at each set of temple ruins which are written in English which helps of you don't have a guide. Interesting and a beautiful location.",August 2018,My Son Sanctuary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g4074589-d317894-Reviews-My_Son_Sanctuary-Duy_Xuyen_District_Quang_Nam_Province.html,"Duy Xuyen District, Vietnam",attractions,4.0,4.0
Fantastic tour,"We had the most amazing day on this tour which we booked a day in advance as we liked the sound of the variety. We were picked up from the hotel and driven to meet Hanh eat the market, where we were shown the huge array of local produce and it was explained to us how the foods can be used in local cooking. It was a really interesting experience on its own but we were then taken by car to the river, where we motored down the river and even had a go at steering the vessel! Stopping off at a tiny jetty, we disembarked and then were ushered into small round paddle boats - two to a boat with a 'captain' paddling. Well, we have not laughed so much in a long time as we were entertained by crazy paddling, music and incredible art as the Vietnamese made crickets and hats and fish from the plants at the side of the river. It was then onto the restaurant where we made 4 courses of food and ate it afterwards.

Beautiful blend of activity and quiet,"This beach is beautiful in terms of the beach and sea, but also the outlook. The islands and the hills close to Danang north of here are very pretty. Although there are lots of bars and sunloungers which supply a need for the many tourists, everything is low-rise, so it doesn't affect the feel of the place and it still manages to feel quite small.

Great fun,"We travelled as a family with 2 teenage daughters, so it seemed like a good idea to do the Sights tour which took in a lot of the major tourist sights of the city, but did so in a short (ish) time-frame. The other consideration was the all-female riders, as we have 2 daughters.
The young ladies were very good as guides and excellent drivers at negotiating the crazy streets of HCMC. At each venue, we met with a young male guide who spoke excellent English and who explained the significance of each venue extremely well, being very happy to engage in conversation rather than simply roll out pre-rehearsed information. The 3 and a half hours exceeded our expectations and we were also treated to various snacks and drinks as we went along. It is amazing fun zipping around the streets on the back of a scooter, driven by a local!

No need to rush though, as there is ample opportunity to sample more wine and make further purchases if you so desire.

It is easy to find and very close to the main road filled with bars and restaurants.
We were early, so we had the place fairly much to ourselves and opted to eat at the front table, backed by pretty fairy lights under a fan.
We were very well attended to, the service being excellent and 'proper' without being fussy and nothing was too much trouble.

Early evening visit,"We walked from Lamai central strip north to where the Sunday Night market sets up and found this place. From the outside it has a cafe-type appearance with open sides and minimalist interior.
However, the menu looked very promising with a huge range from which to choose. My one reservation was whether they could produce the quality with such a large menu.
We ordered starters which came along first (which doesn't always happen in Thailand) and they were delicious and quite large. Main courses were BBQ ribs, chicken breast with mushrooms, King prawns with garlic sauce and sea bass with scallop. The quality was excellent, very nicely presented and portion sizes were just right.
