Lovely meal and great staff.,"Just took Mrs P out for lunch and an airing.
Fair play her gammon was like what you would buy from a butcher and not supermarket rubbish.
Eggs had a nice runny yolk too.
My butternut squash and chickpea burger with and red onion chutney was lovely.

Would not offer refund during covid,"I was unable to stay at hotel and was very disappointed with their customer service.
I explained to hotel that my wife and I was travelling from overnight ferry from Helsinki to Stockhlom. The viking ferry had cancelled all crossings which meant being unable to get to hotel.
The only thing they offered me was extending the time I could visit hotel was up to December this year, not even an offer of rescheduling holiday for next year.
With all the upset of covid and mangel self isolating restrictions this was a very poor resolution from them.
The hotel might have been amazing for all I know but customer service is shocking.
We are still going to rebook our Baltic adventure for next year but will definitely not be booking this hotel.
We have had to go the charge back route via credit card to get our money back which I think will cost the hotel more.",September 2020,Tegnérlunden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189852-d8594282-Reviews-Tegnerlunden-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",attractions,1.0,4.0

Absolutely amazing tour and a must do.,"Did the winter fairytale tour with our guide named Katrin from Mamut tours.
Katrin was amazing and very accommodating as I did not want to go up in cable cart because of my fear of heights.
Someone else on tour took the cable car and Katrin took us around Lakes and left us to have some time to our selves while she picked up Shelkey from cable cart and came back for us.
The views of Savic waterfalls , Bohinj,
the mountains and lakes were absolutely stunning.
The tour was €59 per person and was well worth the money.
Katrin said the tour was not as pretty as usual due to the lack of snow, I could not imagine it to be better.
This is a great tour and is a must do when in Bled",January 2020,Mamut Slovenija,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274863-d4507890-Reviews-Mamut_Slovenija-Bled_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,"Bled, Slovenia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Price a bit steep,"My wife is not a breakfast person so I ventured over as my apartment is the Carman which is self catering.
Apparently if you tell them you are from Carmen you get a €3 discount.
My breakfast cost €9 and I dont think that was with discount? To be honest I said this before sitting to eat and paid after so he may have either forgotten or not taken this in, I did not stress this either so maybe partly my fault.
The cold items like serials, yogurt, hams and cheese were quite basic but adequate.
Tge cooked items like bacon, scrambled eggs, bacon etc were cooked to order which was a nice touch as it was fresh and not kept warm under lamps.
I am not sure if you could have second helpings of cooked food?
I love my coffee if I'm honest and quite fussy, their coffee I found to be not that nice.
The person that served me was very polite.
I'm not sure if I am being harsh as I have never paid for a buffet styled breskfast before to know the price.",January 2020,Restaurant Pension Mlino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274863-d2459091-Reviews-Restaurant_Pension_Mlino-Bled_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,"Bled, Slovenia",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Boat trip over to Bled island,"The cost of trip to Bled island is €12 and takes around 10 minutes.

The best view of city,"My wife and I walked up to the castle which took about 20 minutes.
You can take the cable car which is €2 each way per person but I'm scared of heights and could not bring myself to do it.
It is surprising on how much is in the castle from weapons that were used in those days, penitentiary with history guide in various languages, wine tasting and an expensive looking restaurant.

Interesting history of statue,"This was starting point of tour and the history behind the statue us pretty cool.
The statue is of France Prešeren a Slovenian poet, above him is a statue of a girl baring her breasts which really offended the people of Slovenia.
What made it more offensive is it was in plain view as people come out of church, as they could not remove it they tried to disguise it by planting trees by it so it was not seen when coming out of church.
The trees could only do their job of disguise in the summer though, as they are bare in winter which is what we saw.",January 2020,Preseren Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274873-d298648-Reviews-Preseren_Square-Ljubljana_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",attractions,4.0,4.5

I found the history behind the bridge really interesting.

Hotel Apollo has mixed reviews,"The Apollo hotel has mixed reviews.
GOOD POINTS
1) Hotel room is very nice and spacious with facilities to make tea/coffee. Large wet room like shower.

2) Good choice of food for breakfast.
Not many vegan options which is not too difficult to accomodate as found in old town could provide several options, but will provide soya milk if you ask for it.
3) situated close to old town.
Bus number 50 and cost is €0.70 each way takes 10 minutes or 20 minute leisurely walk.
4) There are 2 great restaraunts on hotel doorstep if you want to finish off your night close to hotel.
Have left reviews separately on these 2 restaraunts on trip advisor to check out.
5) 1 great cafe on hotel doorstep called Zufana which is really nice with vegan options which closes at 4pm.
6) outdoor market close by selling clothes, bags,wallets and various fresh fruit and veg.
With cheap cafe's and €1 a pint of lager.
BAD POINTS.
1) Dining room decor is dated and unnerving with stuffed animals at each end of room.
2) Dining room staff are not necessarily rude but unapproachable.
3) Some staff on reception seem rude and funnily it appears to me that it is the senior staff.
4) After reading info supplied in room regarding facilities supplied by hotel.
Information stated that checkouts prior to breakfast starting time you could request a pre packed breakfast with you.

Good value for money,"My wife and I dined here after a walking tour.
Great value for money and friendly staff.
Both meals were Hungarian goulash and a vegetable risotto with 4 large draught beers for 24€.
The only downside was very few vegan options, but that is quite common I am finding here in Brstislava",September 2019,Cafe Verne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274924-d740026-Reviews-Cafe_Verne-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Meal before flight.,"I only had a meal once at the Park Plaza Arena just before flying.
The staff were great, very comfortable surroundings and excellent meal.
I had penne pasta which had an abundance of carrots,broccoli and cauliflower and was truly fully.
The price was very good and very much the same as local restaurants, which I was very surprised at.",July 2019,Park Plaza Arena Pula,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295373-d553377-Reviews-Park_Plaza_Arena_Pula-Pula_Istria.html,"Pula, Croatia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Good value for money.,"Fair play I can honestly say I ate out at a number of restaurants on my stay in Pula and this was by far the best.
I was recommended this place to eat at from a lady who sells the boat tours.
She said a lot of the locals eat there and the prices are better than most surrounding restaurants.
On both occasions of eating there I was totally stuffed on the Vegetariana Pizza.
I had the same vegetarian type pizza in other restaurants and was still hungry afterwards.
Great spacious restaurant, lovely meals and friendly staff",July 2019,Jupiter,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295373-d1101125-Reviews-Jupiter-Pula_Istria.html,"Pula, Croatia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Hotel Brioni,"After reading some of these reviews I have to say some of them are a bit harsh.
Even on the first day of checking in we had been upgraded to a room with a sea view without asking and for no extra cost, I don't know why but it was very much appreciated.
Yes there are some things that cosmetically need doing to the hotel, (air conditioning for certain ) and is out of there control to correct.
That being said the hotel is being refurbished next year to bring it up to a 4 star rating like other hotels on the complex.
In my opinion if you do not bring any issues to the attention of the hotel Managers at the time of your stay how can you expect them to put things right.
Without going into it too much detail I got off to a bad start with the hotel at the beginning of my stay.
After I bringing my complaint to the attention of Nenad and Christina which are the hotels Management team, they both could not possibly have done any more for us than they did and were very apologetic.
They even arranged for us to stay in our rooms until we departed at 3pm when normal checkout time is 10am.
What sealed the deal is having an afternoon lunch at their neighbouring 4 star hotel with a glass of wine.
Yes the the service at the neighbouring hotel was on a different level and something that they are heading towards replicating themselves with refurbishment next year.
Would I stay here again when this is done is definitely a yes from me.
So all I can say don't wait until you get home and write a poor review unless you have given them a chance to resolve any issues first.",July 2019,Brioni Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295373-d506794-Reviews-Brioni_Hotel-Pula_Istria.html,"Pula, Croatia",hotels,3.0,3.0
