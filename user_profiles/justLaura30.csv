Amazing Service,"I stayed in the Al Manara for 4 nights and 5 days. It’s a lovely building and upon arrival was made to feel extremely welcome, a cold towel, Arabic coffee and hibiscus juice were offered.

Check-In:
It was not busy upon arrival and the whole check in process went very smoothly. Arrived around 1-1:30 and was given a room straight away.

Room:
The room was on the third floor. A lovely large balcony overlooking the lagoon and sea. Very quiet location. The balcony did not get direct sunlight, which is good in the summer but a bit cooler this time of year. The room was a good size. Bed was extremely comfortable. Overall it’s a good size.

Cleaning: They services our room daily. However many reminders and phone calls were needed to ensure they replaced things they took, such as towels that had been used were taken and not replaced. I called housekeeping and they came with replacements fairly quickly and by the third day I did not have to call and ask for replacements of things they had taken to be washed.

Breakfast: it was included in my room rate and I have to say it had a very good selection of warm and cold dishes. Never went hungry and the staff remembered if we liked tea, coffee or even a smoothie!

Staff: The staff was what make this hotel stand out. Nothing is too much to ask for. They will go out of their way to ensure you are happy and taken care of. What I’d noticeable is there is a breakdown in communication somewhere within the hotel. However the staff on the front lines do their best to fix any problem, nothing is too big or too small for them to help solve.

Facilities: This was probably the biggest issue with the hotel during the 4 nights. At no point before our arrival or during our check in process did anyone inform us that the main pool was closed and under construction. When we brought this up to the man who checked us in later on the first day, he made it seem silly that we had a problem with it as they have 3 smaller beaches and they had opened the small villa pool for all residents in the hotel. Needless to say later on I spoke with Nadar about the situation and how if we had known we would have picked a different hotel. He was extremely understanding and worked with us to make up for the lack of information and communication on the hotels side.

Overall I enjoyed my time within this hotel. The staff are what really make this place special! I would recommend this hotel for people looking for a nice quiet getaway. If you’re looking for a good sized main pool then wait until the renovations are completed, which they said would hopefully be mid/end of March (2020).",February 2020,"Al Manara, A Luxury Collection Hotel, Saraya Aqaba",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298101-d13630880-Reviews-Al_Manara_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Saraya_Aqaba-Aqaba_Al_Aqabah_Governorate.html,"Aqaba, Jordan",hotels,4.0,4.5
Go Early,"I just got back from a week in Greece and I started my holiday in Athens.

I knew one of the first places I wanted to see was Acropolis so on my first morning I set off. I had read a lot of blogs, reviews and tops before going.

I set off later then I had planned about 8:30 am instead of 7:30am. However, due to it be shoulder season I found that it was not that busy at all when I arrived. I was staying in the Center of Athens and walked there from my accommodation. The walk is not as bad as I had thought after reading all of the reviews and didn’t take long at all!

Once up there, there is a viewing place you can walk up and take some lovely photos. I did this first and then went to buy my ticket. Did not have to wait in a line for a ticket and I bought the €30 ticket for all 7 major sites.

I was leaving Acropolis not that all after 10am and it was getting fairly busy. So my top tip is make sure you arrive before 10am during shoulder season.

Otherwise all was well and not too crowded for taking pictures and what not!",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Relaxing,"I stayed here for 3 nights this week. I was not disappointed at all! They have redecorated their rooms and everything is bright, modern and extremely clean. Everyone who works for this hotel are very friendly and helpful!

I stayed in room 6 and it had amazing views and I felt it was fairly private. As you walk around Santorini you realise how private this place is compared to many others on the island.

The breakfast is also something to mention. It comes with some standard dishes, juices and coffee and tea and you also get to select additional dishes daily. It’s delivered to your room at the time you choose as well!

Overall I would highly recommend this location and hotel if you want to be in the middle of everything going on. Very close to restaurants and walking paths all the way to Oia.",October 2019,Nefeles Suites Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d579677-Reviews-Nefeles_Suites_Hotel-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Nice view,"My friend and I walked our way through Hong Kong to go into the worlds highest bar, Ozone. Once inside it was not exactly what I had expected.

The staff are very friendly and attentive and outside they have amazing views! Obviously, as expected the drinks are pricey, but you are in a very popular tourist destination so that was no surprise to me.

As it was October up so high it was very cold for us. We went outside took some pictures of the view and then moved back inside. I think if they had blankets at the time we might have tried to stay outside a little longer.

If you like the idea of a nice drink in the ‘highest bar’ in the world I would recommend going, just remember it might cost you a few HKD.",October 2018,OZONE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294217-d2198231-Reviews-OZONE-Hong_Kong.html,"Hong Kong, China",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Half Day Desert Safari,"I took my friend from Australia on their half day trip. We had a fantastic driver called Faris. He was was informative and a good laugh during the whole experience.

It's fantastic value for money as it was just the two of us that went out. My friend was even able to go on a quick camel ride before the dune bashing began.

Highly recommend this company for any of their packages.",April 2018,Qatar Inbound Tours - Private Day Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294009-d3953996-Reviews-Qatar_Inbound_Tours_Private_Day_Tours-Doha.html,"Doha, Qatar",attractions,5.0,5.0
Lovely!,"Just visited Dubai Opera House for the first time!

My friends and I went to see Mary Poppins. As I am use to seeing shows in London I was pleasantly surprised to see how spacious the seating area was. There was a lot of leg room and the seats were very comfortable.

The facilities and decor were very nice as well. The bar allowed you to pre order drinks for intermission, which I wasn't sure if they would do.

All of the staff were very helpful. Overall a very lovely experience.",May 2017,Dubai Opera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d10825690-Reviews-Dubai_Opera-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,5.0,4.5
Quick visit,"This was my second time going to Dubai mall as a visitor.

The mall is big so it is best to have a plan if you actually want to go shopping. Ensure you know the shops you want to go to and begin! All over the mall there are interactive maps to help you locate and find the route from your current location.

It is also nice just to walk around and see everything that is going on. Though the mall is busy, it's so large it's hardly noticeable in most areas. Obviously around the Aquarium it's busier then other areas.

They have a huge selection in the food court and being from Canada originally it is exciting to see a New York Fries that serves a poutine.

I highly recommend a visit if you're in the area!",May 2017,The Dubai Mall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d1210327-Reviews-The_Dubai_Mall-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,4.0,4.5
Good value for money!,"My friends and I just got back from a weekend away in Dubai, and we stayed at these apartments.

As there were 4 of us we stayed in a two bedroom apartment. It was large and spacious with modern finishings.

The location is good if you're going to the opera house, Dubai mall or any other downtown location. It is fairly far out from the palm, so if you're looking to spend your time there I would not recommend these flats.

They have many of the same amenities as a hotel such as, room service, cleaners etc...

The only down side we had with the two bedroom apartment we stayed in was the room with the ensuite had the only bath and shower in the whole apartment. It would have been nice if there was at least a shower in the second bathroom. They have however opted to put a washing machine in the second bathroom for those guests who would be having a longer stay, so I can see their thinking behind this.

While staying here we asked if we could use the pool at the hotel next door as it was bigger and better then the one the apartments have. We were told yes and so we did.

There are many shops and restaurants within walking distance from these apartments as well which is extremely useful.

Overall we were all very happy staying here and would recommend them to anyone going for a city break or long holiday!",May 2017,Nassima Tower Hotel Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d2239408-Reviews-Nassima_Tower_Hotel_Apartments-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,4.0
Good location,"I stayed here for three nights with my friend while we were visiting Singapore. We had a lovely view of the marina, which included a view of MBS, supertrees and the lion! The room was a good size and modern. The breakfast had an amazing choice of foods and was delicious. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is connected to Suntec shopping area, which is also where you can get the hop on and hop off bus for sight seeing. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who has a few days and wants to do sightseeing or business!",April 2017,Pan Pacific Singapore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294265-d302294-Reviews-Pan_Pacific_Singapore-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",hotels,5.0,4.5
Very cool!,I went to see the Supertrees. I could see the light show that takes place at 7:45 and 8:45pm from my balcony at my hotel but I wanted to see it up close as I read it had music to match the show. I went during the day to see the supertrees and thought they were very interesting. I went back at night for the light show and thought it was amazing! Seeing it with the music is fantastic. I highly recommend going to the light show! I also think it's worth a look in the daylight as well!,April 2017,Gardens by the Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294265-d2149128-Reviews-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",attractions,4.0,4.5
Cool place to hangout,Clarke Quay is a very good place to visit in the evening. Both times I went it was around 8:30/9pm. There are many different restaurants and bars to visit. It's a good size and no way did I see or even visit a handful of the places there. Live music in some places and good DJ's in others. A water feature in the middle that young children were around around in as well. Most of the places have happy hours that finish around 9pm. I highly recommend this area for a night out or dinner with a good atmosphere!,April 2017,Clarke Quay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294265-d324756-Reviews-Clarke_Quay-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",attractions,5.0,4.5
Dinner with a view!,"My friend and I booked in for their buffet dinner in the revolving dinner restaurant. It wasn't too expensive but more expensive then a regular restaurant in KL.

The views are worth it tho! It takes about 1-2 hours to go all the way around and the buffet food is in the middle and stands still, be careful or you might lose place of where your table is!

When it got dark the windows did not glare when you took photos, which I noticed did happen on the observation deck.

You also get access to the observation deck when you book into the dinner.

Overall I was very glad I booked this! I highly recommend it.",April 2017,Menara Kuala Lumpur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298570-d454880-Reviews-Menara_Kuala_Lumpur-Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",attractions,4.0,4.0
Shopping,"For those who enjoy shopping and getting a bargain this is the place to go! It's also in close walking distances to many other tourist spots so overall a must see.

If you like to buy small tourist gifts this is the best place to find them at a good rate. There are food places as well.

You can find almost anything in central market which was handy when my friends phone charger broke!

Relaxing!,"I stayed here for 6 nights. The staff were amazing! I emailed about a transfer from the airport to the hotel, they responded quickly with great news that because I was staying for so many nights I was able to get free a free transfer! My flight was three hours delayed and they were there waiting with a smilie in the middle of the night.

Nothing you ask is too much for this team. They always went above and beyond! Breakfast was delivered to my pin every morning and I picked the night before what I wanted and what time I would like it delivered. The Internet was 24/7 and very strong at all times!

I would highly recommend staying here if you're looking for a quiet and relaxing experience.

Thank you again to the team at Aishwarya!
