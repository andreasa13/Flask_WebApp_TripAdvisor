What a gem,"In the Ancient Agora area - a lovely peaceful oasis in a busy city.

The temple is impressive and remarkably well restored, take time to visit",February 2020,Temple of Hephaestus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1064133-Reviews-Temple_of_Hephaestus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
You can't miss this in Athens,"A place of amazing history - fantastic views and you feel like you are walking in the footsteps of thousands.

In off season (it was still 16 degrees in February) the entrance charge is reduced to 10 euros per person and it you must pay to get up close.

I think if its raining it might be slippy underfoot and suspect it can get very hot as there is no shade.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Lunch with a beautiful view,"Sitting outside in the sunshine with a view of the Acropolis - can't beat it

The service was excellent and we were not rushed whist we made the most of the view.

We had a salad and a croque madam both were well made delicious and served quickly

Don't walk past- after you have walked up to the Acropolis take time to relax here",February 2020,Dionysos Zonar's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1061815-Reviews-Dionysos_Zonar_s-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Hytra - February 2020,"An interesting but expensive experience and there is much better food available in Athens.

We emailed twice to book as the first response was confusing.

On arrival we were made to sit downstairs in the Onassis building until our booking time of 8pm

We were then sat next to the bar and presented with the a la carte menu not the gourmet tasting menu we had booked . When I pointed this out were moved to the nicer part of the restaurant!

We had the 8 course taster menu - the food was good but not overly flavoursome and tiny portions, however it was unique and the scallops were fabulous.

The service was good but did not make us feel particularly welcomed- tables were close together and waiters stood chatting to one another - I expected more and would not recommend it to others, I have eaten in places like this before and felt that in terms of food, quality and quantity and the service it could have been better",February 2020,Hytra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3709153-Reviews-Hytra-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Radisson Blu Park Hotel Athens - February 2020,"A lovely hotel a bit out of town but only a 5 euro taxi or metro ride away from the centre.
The superior rooms overlooking the park are worth paying extra for, the inside rooms are smaller and overlook the air conditioning!
Don't miss out on the rooftop restaurant and bar - amazing service and great food",February 2020,"Radisson Blu Park Hotel, Athens",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d230393-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Park_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
