Perfect Getaway,"Loved the hotel location just on the esplanade easy access from hotel rooms. Just a little tip - if you dont like stairs ask for the bottom level! We had 3rd floor which is the top, was all good for us as we are fit but parents had 2nd floor and was a struggle for them also with luggage. Pool was amazing, just wish we had stayed longer to enjoy it more. Kids if we brought them would of loved it too. Rooms are perfect size with great spa bath with opening shutters. Little balcony that overlooked corner of the street towards the beach. Loved all the plants around the property very tropical.

Best hotel/resort ever!,"From the moment we arrived 5 star class and beyond! We had our family of 9 people stay for 8-16nights for some with the luxury escape package. I kin it was little expensive for Bali but all worth every cent! I have paid more in Australia for less than luxury than this place. Staff was friendly and always helpful, manager greeted us on the first day at breakfast and then set us up with the same table every day and remembered every persons order for drinks! The buffet breakfast was amazing! Hot breakfast included eggs the way u like it fresh! Pancakes for the children, fried banana !!! Chinese, Indonesian , Japanese and fresh pastries. All types of fresh juices!! Just the best!
Our room was fit for a queen, large room owning up to balcony with jacuzzi and day bed. Bathroom large bath shower and toilet all very private and beautiful.
The outside massive pool was the best pool I have ever been in with temperature and the beautiful feel of the Whitsunday's sand the waterfall and the slide(so fast!) children had so much fun! The resort is made to feel for all people not just the rich but family orientated. Kids club was fun for the children with extra money for ice cream and activities like painting eggs to keep. But very friendly and well worth having the adult time upstairs at the roof top bar with our free cocktails nightly and massages in the spa was amazing!! Wish I had another week in Bali the place was outstanding!!

Ok! Nothing I would brag about!,"Stayed over Easter. Firstly easy to find , good location, public transport out the door. Food, bars, restaurants all great walking distance at your door step. BUT rooms were neat , roomy but very old, dark and mouldy smell walking down the hall way. My room had no natural light from 2nd floor. Looked into a wall, so I was disappointed, tried to get different room but asked to pay extra $30 night for 2 bedroom.
My double bed was sunken in the middle so I didn't have a goodnight sleep at all. TV was very quiet you couldn't turn it up.
The bathroom had a laundry very useful if the dryer worked! Maintenance tried to fix but couldn't.
Wifi!! Well that doesn't last long! Car park is the smallest ever,,, my car got scratches from someone the first day!! Then I had no car park another day and then tried to give me a fine!
The streets are disgusting in st kilda very scary to walk around at anytime of day. I wouldn't stay in the area again.
The staff was friendly and very helpful. Thank u.",April 2015,Adina Apartment Hotel St Kilda Melbourne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255360-d286101-Reviews-Adina_Apartment_Hotel_St_Kilda_Melbourne-St_Kilda_Port_Phillip_Greater_Melbourne_Victor.html,"St Kilda, Australia",hotels,3.0,4.0
Fantastic park,"we had two nights while on our way home after Easter from Melbourne. 2 young children loved the cabin and enjoyed visiting the large jump pillow , playground and movies room.
Sovereign hill was a short walk from back entrance of park, the kids loved it.
