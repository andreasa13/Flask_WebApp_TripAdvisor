"spectacular, though very crowded","This is a spectacular sight!! I strongly recommend seeing this very early in the day. Even though September is considered off season, this attraction was terribly crowded. The entrance to the main area is small and it takes a long time to get through the congestion. However, I say, this is a MUST see. Wear good walking shoes and bring your patience. Also at night the area is beautifully lit and quite beautiful.

beautiful room at a beautiful hotel,"We really enjoyed our weekend stay at The Hotel Grand Pacific. It was girl's weekend with four of us staying in the same room.
