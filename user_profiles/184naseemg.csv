Nice hotel,We stayed at the hotel apartment which had 3 rooms. It was a very nice apartment. It's far from the city n quite inside from the main road. There were no tuk tuk around so we had to take a motorcycle to call for a tuk tuk. Taxis were there but their prices were very high not worth at all.

WORST HOTEL DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL,"I stayed at this nightmare hotel for 3 nights. Worst hotel I have come across. I had to change the room on my 1st night as the room was smelly and so the toilet. They gave me another terrible room where there was no water. I got late at night so didn’t realized until next morning. In breakfast had ordered bread and omelett but was served only omelett as ""he forgot to bring the bread"". Had to call several times from the room but still no one came.
The hotel was almost empty but still these people didn’t have any courtesy at all.
