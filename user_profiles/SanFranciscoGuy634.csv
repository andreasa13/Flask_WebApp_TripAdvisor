"Charming and Tasty - Interesting History, Warm Welcome","We were passing through Arcadia and stopped at Mary Margaret's for an early lunch - really early, as in 10 AM. The waitress on duty welcomed us warmly - appropriately masked up ""given the situation."" We had a good early lunch, learned a lot about the community, and really enjoyed the visit. We even took out some baklava for dessert at home that evening. I wish we lived closer so we could stop in more often.",September 2020,Mary Margaret's Tea and Biscuit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29172-d1746560-Reviews-Mary_Margaret_s_Tea_and_Biscuit-Arcadia_Florida.html,"Arcadia, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.5
I Love Good Chocolate. Adam Delivers!,"We chose a dozen or so of Turoni's chocolates to take home and savor over several days. Yum. Creative flavors. Excellent art of the chocolate.

"Curious Story, Great Place to Sit and Recharge","The story of the waving girl is interesting. You do wonder why she became obsessed with waving at all the passing boats, but it was her life to live and that's how she did it. We enjoyed thinking about her - and sitting on the welcoming benches to recharge after we had walked along the river park.",February 2020,The Waving Girl Statue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60814-d8693164-Reviews-The_Waving_Girl_Statue-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Jepson - Terrific; Telfair - Fascinating History,The Jepson's modern design it terrific - very creative architecture that complements the historic square and its neighbors. The slanting light beams are fascinating. The exhibits on offer when we visited were well done. The Telfair Museum is its historic partner in art. What we found most interesting is the history of the Telfair Mansion and its development into a modern museum from a past firmly rooted in slavery. It's important to take the tour which brings the Telfair to life.,February 2020,Jepson Center and Telfair Museums Admission Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g60814-d14952913-Jepson_Center_and_Telfair_Museums_Admission_Ticket-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",activities,4.0,4.5
"Really Good - ""Worth a Detour""",We were walking by this place on the way to the Jepson Museum and decided to recharge. It looks like a typical college town place for coffee and munchies - very laid back and comfortable. Turns out that the coffee is excellent - they roast it themselves and have been doing so for 100 years. The pastries are over-the-top delicious. Skip lunch.

Good Food - Rapid Service,"We visited with friends. Vic's menu is interesting and the food we had was good. The crab cakes are terrific. It's a crowded and very popular place along the historic river - better than many of its neighbors for sure and obviously a destination for both locals and visitors. The service was very brisk - we felt a bit as if we were being ""processed quickly"" to turn the table. No matter. We weren't on a romantic adventure.",February 2020,Vic's On the River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60814-d606511-Reviews-Vic_s_On_the_River-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Local Landmark,"The Olde Pink House is one of those restaurants you can find in many cities - a place where ""everyone goes"". So we went, though a bit cautiously, and were surprised at how good it actually is. It's a bit of an ""organism"" - a dozen or so (I think) dining rooms. Lots of activity. A warm welcome at the front door and then rapid escort to your table. Elegant? Not really. Comfortable? Yes. Really good service. Fast service. A menu that includes lots of temptations and is, on the whole, quite good. It doesn't offer the best and most creative cuisine in Savannah, but the food is better than you might expect. My shrimp and fried grit cakes was excellent, for example. Would I go here to ""whisper sweet nothings and propose marriage"" - well, probably not. But it's a fun place and good enough to go again - as many people obviously do, both locals and visitors.",February 2020,Olde Pink House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60814-d252767-Reviews-Olde_Pink_House-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Lovely Park - Full of Life - a Must Visit,"As visitors to the city, we were eager to explore Forsyth Park and were not disappointed. It offers a mix of fountains, statures, green lawns, flowers and a small arboretum as well. Lots of people walking about and enjoying its delights as well, including the (somewhat) aggressive bicyclists zooming through the ""no bicycle"" zones. Oh well.

Impressive Catholic Cathedral,My wife and I like to visit historic churches. Savannah has many. This cathedral welcomes visitors ($3 donation suggested/expected - but that's only fair).

Tourist and Conventioneer Mecca,"The Riverfront Plaza is a bit of a mixed bag. Great river views - and amazing perspective on the big cargo ships going past. To my mind, the views and ships are the best aspects of the riverfront area. The shops and restaurants that line the adjacent street vary from interesting to totally tourist tacky. Obviously the riverfront area attracts a lively crowd to eat and drink after hours. It's where the action is after dark.

"Attractive dining rooms, Fine service, Good food","All in all our lunch at Husk was very good. Virtually all the dishes we four ordered were really good and mostly southern-inspired. Excellent wine list. Outstanding service. My only quibble was with the fried chicken which had a crust that was so hard that it was difficult to cut through it. Perhaps it had been fried just a bit too long or something like that. Otherwise, our lunch here was excellent.",February 2020,Husk Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60814-d13385622-Reviews-Husk_Restaurant-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great Pub Lunch,"We've spent a lot of time in London and have always enjoyed eating at its iconic pubs. Often the atmosphere is better than the food, but the experience is fine regardless. The menu at the Six Pence might be described as Classic British Pub meets America. So you can get a ploughman's lunch as well as a grilled reuben. I like both. Beers too. The decor is ""so pub"" that it's almost ""more pub than a real pub in London"". All in all, this is a delightful place and we had a fine lunch. Good service too.",February 2020,Six Pence Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60814-d437017-Reviews-Six_Pence_Pub-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Great Stop even if you aren't a SCAD Parent!,"SCAD is everywhere in Savannah. Stop at SCADstory to understand how this remarkable college was founded and why is is thriving. You will receive a warm welcome and have the chance to see a 15 min film that tells SCAD's story. It's done well as you would expect of a film produced by a school of art and design.

"Delightful, Fascinating, Walkable - the Heart of Savannah","The Savannah Historic District is the reason was visited the city - along with the excellent restaurants. It is organized around squares, with with its own history. Lots of statues of heroes from colonial times, to the Revolution, to the Civil War (both sides), civic leaders, and on and on. It seems you can live through the most important periods of American history just by walking around. Lots of mature trees and flowers. Tempting restaurants and shops. Some really interesting museums. Very pedestrian friendly. All in all, it's the memory of this district that will define our sense of Savannah in the future. My advice: choose a hotel in this district and explore, explore, explore.",February 2020,Savannah Historic District,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60814-d181706-Reviews-Savannah_Historic_District-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Breakfast Excellent. Dinner Not so Good,We were staying in the DeSoto and decided to try their main dining room - the 1540 - for dinner. The menu looked interesting and the food turned out to be quite good. My wife's chicken potpie was excellent. My shrimp and grits was somewhat less successful but still good. The large dining room was nearly deserted at prime dinner time - only a couple of tables were occupied - and on a night when other restaurants nearby were buzzing (based on attempts to get bookings). Some things are working at 1540. Other things are not. It needs tuning up. (Breakfast service and food were both excellent by the way.),February 2020,1540 Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60814-d12714430-Reviews-1540_Room-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Excellent Food and Drinks,"Edgar's P&P shouts ""trendy designer"" which can be initially a bit off-putting. High stools which is the latest ""concept,"" one room with a zillion TV screens tuned to sports, and so forth. The place buzzes with a younger crowd, so the design must be working. We were most interested in the quality of the food and drinks more than the buzz and hook-ups, since we arrived on a day when the hotel's main dining room was closed. I'm pleased to say that the food offerings (as sampled and enjoyed from very high stools) were truly excellent as were the drinks - even the historic ""Aviation"" which seems to be enjoying somewhat of a comeback. We came back for pre-dinner nibbles and drinks each day. Highly recommended.",February 2020,Edgar's Proof & Provision,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60814-d12639629-Reviews-Edgar_s_Proof_Provision-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great Staff, Good Service, Comfortable, Great Location","We met friends here for a several day exploration of Savannah. The DeSoto's location was ideal for us - in easy walking distance of the main area of Savannah. As others have noted, the lobby screams ""trendy designer"" and is a bit on the sterile side, not really inviting and comfy at all. However, the quality of the staff made up for whatever shortcomings of the lobby design and the room we had was quite comfortable. Great staff included Avi (restaurants), Amanda Marks (concierge), as well Unique (housekeeping), Tiara (front desk) and Felix (engineer) who helped us with some minor room issues, along with Amelia and Ivan - terrific breakfast/bar servers. We quickly came to enjoy our stay at the deSoto and look forward to returning in the future.",February 2020,The DeSoto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60814-d86792-Reviews-The_DeSoto-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",hotels,4.0,4.0
Delightful Evening. Good Food.,"We met friends here - Rosemary and Thyme - for dinner recently. The menu was tempting in many ways.

A True Destination Restaurant in Bradenton - Eat Here!,"We are foodies who check out places around the world - and in our home area too. Chateau 13 is truly excellent. I would say that it's one of the best restaurants in the greater Sarasota Bay area. The menu is imaginative. The style - from tapas temptations to full courses - is delightful and should make any diner happy. The dishes we ordered were very well prepared, nicely presented and seriously delicious. The wine selection, both by the bottle and glass, is remarkable. Service was welcoming and professional. Chateau 13 has seating areas for everyone, from high-top tables and bar seating that appeal to the trendy set to comfortable tables for those who prefer lower altitudes.

"Very Popular, Good Food, Lively Vibe","After passing BB many times, we finally decided to book for dinner. We discovered that it is very popular with diners of all ages - from families, to students from nearby Hunter College, and lots of others as well - like the two of us. The place was buzzing at 6 PM. Seating is ""very New York"" by which I mean crowded. This is not a place to whisper sweet nothings to your companion unless you want them heard and maybe even commented upon by people at the next table, some of which may actually be closer to you than your companion across your table. My pasta dish was excellent. The salad we had also was very good. My fritto misto was not quite as good as it should be, but it's not an easy dish to make (even though it seems simple). Good drinks. Good wines. I can see why this place is so popular.

"Tasty, Lively, High Chairs, Good Tapas","We like tapas so we booked here to give it a try for dinner. It's a place with a very lively vibe, the sort of destination at happy hour for groups of young staff from nearby offices. The music is not mellow Sinatra. Seating is almost all (maybe all) of the super high style that is so popular in many places. So, if you have any problem climbing into one of those high chairs, this may not be your best destination. All that said, we had a good fast meal of drinks and tapas. Service was excellent. The people at the next table were friendly.

New Moma Rocks! Buy a Membership!,"The new MOMA is now open. Lots more space. Imaginative exhibits. So much to do and see. Even the cafe is redone. We stopped just to check things out and prepare ourselves for returning to ""do"" Moma seriously. It will take quite a few return visits to do it justice. Even though there were a lot of people doing the same thing, the new galleries seemed to absorb them so you didn't feel hassled by crowds. If you really love Moma and plan to return frequently, it's a good idea to buy a membership.

"Pleasant, Good Food, But...","We have eaten at Barbaresco several times of the past year. Its dining area is very attractive and welcoming. The food is good - not super good or terrific, but good and satisfying. The cocktails are well made. The selection of wines will keep most people happy. Our only significant complaint has to do with the sense that the staff are working really hard to turn the tables as fast as possible. No one would ever say the service is slow here. You can barely touch your napkin before a waiter asks you for your drink order. And after that, it can seem that it's off to the races. Everything comes fast. The waiters appear and disappear as if they were on fast forward. So, you have no problem getting in and out quickly. They have no problem turning the tables. But sometimes you just want to take a deep breath and put the control on pause.

DO Eat Here - It's One of the Best,"I think of great diners as an American culinary art form. The best have straightforward menus with ""all the usual"" one of my favorites being grilled bacon and cheese (I know - an invitation to the cardiologist) with cole slaw on the side. The best are friendly, clean and have fast service. The best are good all times of the day. New York City is a treasure trove of diners - some great and some just good and a number that look awful but I'm not sure because I avoid awful. Eat Here Now is one of the best.

Fascinating - Do Not Miss!,"Thank goodness that Flagler family descendants took the lead in creating Flagler College out of the largely defunct Hotel Ponce De Leon, itself an architectural and cultural treasure that had its heyday in the 1920-1930s. The best way to see the college's signature main building is by a student-led tour at 10AM and 2PM. Tickets can be purchased in the main lobby. Our guide was Jamie and she was terrific. Hooray Jamie. Even her bad humor was good. Why didn't my college look like this place?

"Fascinating, Important, and a Great Recharge",Walking down the lively St. George Street you can easily miss St. Photios. Don't pass it by. The rest of the street is a mix of businesses and restaurants and bars of all sorts - with some historic properties mixed in. If you duck into St. Photios you enter a much quieter world that tells the story of the role that ordinary Greek immigrants played in the development of the region and St. Augustine in particular. You can learn a lot.,December 2019,St. Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34599-d2525853-Reviews-St_Photios_Greek_Orthodox_National_Shrine-St_Augustine_Florida.html,"St. Augustine, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Small, Idiosyncratic, Book Carefully","The St. George Inn anchors one end of St. George Street, the pedestrian walking street of central St. Augustine. The inn consists of six buildings with small businesses on the ground floor and rooms on the upper level. We were told that each room is different. The view you get depends on which building you are in and which way you are facing - so you can overlook a busy street, the seaside, or the pedestrian area. Some of the businesses are of the sort you would find on the boardwalk at the Jersey shore. Others are more upscale. The rooms vary as well. Breakfast is a simple morning buffet and excellent as well. The owner/proprietor could not have been more welcoming and pleasant. Parking is in a garage down the street. This place genuinely has personality. My advice is to look carefully at the rooms on their website and then call them to make the right choice for you. We were glad we stayed here and would do so again.",December 2019,St. George Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34599-d278190-Reviews-St_George_Inn-St_Augustine_Florida.html,"St. Augustine, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.5
Excellent Guide - Avi is Terrific,"We booked Avi for a private tour of Jerusalem - with pickup at Ashdod cruise terminal. Little did we anticipate that we would be visiting on a major Israeli holiday. Jerusalem was jammed. Fortunately, Avi knew all the back streets and special places to park so we were able to see a lot during the day he took us around. Avi is full of information and presents it in a fascinating way. If we were going to Jerusalem again, he would be one of the first people we would contact for help.",October 2019,See Israel With Avi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293984-d10819818-Reviews-See_Israel_With_Avi-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html,"Tel Aviv, Israel",attractions,5.0,5.0
A Great Stroll - Tasty and Tacky Too. Don't Miss It.,"St. George Street defines the heart of the St. Augustine ""downtown"" and makes for a great stroll at all times of day. It has a variety of small restaurants, pubs, shops and so forth. One end is a bit on the tacky side - more like what you would find on the boardwalk at the Jersey shore. The other end is more upscale. You get it all! It's fun and we wandered along this street many times over a couple day stay in this historic city.",December 2019,St. George Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34599-d199044-Reviews-St_George_Street-St_Augustine_Florida.html,"St. Augustine, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great Local Restaurant - Very Popular for Good Reasons,We were on a cross Florida jaunt by car and stopped at Ocala for lunch. We asked around about which restaurants were popular in town - and Harry's was mentioned by several people. It's right on the main square so it's easy to find with no problem parking. The food was excellent as was the service. Just what we were looking for. It was almost full of what appeared to be happy eaters. I can see why it was recommended to us - and I am happy to recommend it to others.,December 2019,Harry's Seafood Bar and Grille,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34496-d538687-Reviews-Harry_s_Seafood_Bar_and_Grille-Ocala_Florida.html,"Ocala, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A Real Treat,"Ocala is in the middle of North Central Floria. You have to want to go there to get there. right outside is a real treat - the Appleton Art Museum. Its collection is somewhat eclectic, reflecting the interests of the family that created it. When we visited, on a bit of a whim as we were driving from St. Augustine to Sarasota, two special exhibits were on offer. One was of paintings relating to the Impressionist period - a traveling exhibit organized by the Reading Museum in Pennsylvania. It was outstanding. Well worth a special journey to experience it. The other was a special Christmas collection of a local notable family. It falls in the ""popular locally"" category and was fun to see. The Appleton is a real treasure. It's well worth visiting if you are in the area or if you just want a special adventure.",December 2019,Appleton Museum of Art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34496-d573207-Reviews-Appleton_Museum_of_Art-Ocala_Florida.html,"Ocala, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.5

"Outstanding Boutique Hotel-Great Location, Great Staff",We booked here because we didn't want to stay in a big hotel on Syntagma Square. Instead we wanted a smaller and more personal hotel in the walking area of Plaka with all its small. restaurants and meandering streets. AVA delivered! Excellent facilities. Great breakfasts.

One of the Greats of the World,"This is one of those museums that is “over the top” in terms of its collections. After all, a lot happened in Greece over the years, and that’s putting it mildly.

Well Worth Visiting,This museum is a recreation of the central square/marketplace of Ancient Agora. You can imagine bumping into Socrates as you went about your daily life. What’d would you say to Socrates? Interesting to think about. The agora was a site of conversation and debate about the issues of the day - long before Facebook took over.

Lovely Oasis from the Urban Scrum,"The National Garden of Athens is next to the Parliament Building and across from the main square. In other words, it’s in the middle of all the action. That’s its charm. You can enter the garden and escape the action. To be frank, it’s not one of the world’s great gardens. It has been sorely neglected presumably because of budget constraints. Regardless, it’s an oasis.

Exceptional! Great Setting. Terrific Food.,"The food in so many Greek restaurants soon begins to look the same. The same dishes keep popping up. That’s ok of course, but at a certain point you begin to crave something different. Some variation on the theme. That’s the time when you should go to AMA Lachei. It certainly is Greek but what the do here with Greek themes is amazing. The food is simply outstanding. Fresh. Innovative in a good way. Organized in small plates (meze) which keeps things informal. The tables are scattered on large patio under trees. The location can be a bit challenging to find since the entrance (down a few steps from the street) is in the middle of Athen’s food market. So you have to make your way down a street filled with vegetable/fish/flower stands and lots of Greeks angling for the best price. Somehow it all works. Somehow also you find the restaurant. The rest is wonderful.",October 2019,Ama Lachei at Nefeli's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6437392-Reviews-Ama_Lachei_at_Nefeli_s-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Center of Roman Catholicism in a Land of Greek Orthodox,"Something like 95% of Greeks identify as Christians. Virtually all are Greek Orthodox, and a small number are Roman Catholics and various other denominations. It is interesting to visit this cathedral to compare and contrast it with the many Greek Orthodox churches, which are much more ornate and somehow express clearly the deep connection that Greeks have with the Orthodox Church.
