Excellent service and polite driver,"The best service. I recommend them. My driver help us around Brighton when I needed help to move my son in Sussex campus. He waited for us to unload and he made sure that my son took his room key.
When I was going back to Gatwick airport there were road works on the highway and I was going to loose my flight and he make arrangements with another taxi driver to pick me up from a bridge so I was able finally to take my flight. Thanks a lot. My driver name is Elvis.
Sure I feel that there is someone in Brighton that can help my son if he needs something.",September 2020,Brighton City Chauffeur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1897554-d16408634-Reviews-Brighton_City_Chauffeur-Brighton_and_Hove_East_Sussex_England.html,"Brighton and Hove, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
