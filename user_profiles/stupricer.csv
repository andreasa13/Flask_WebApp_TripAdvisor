Great experience,"This was a fun place to visit where the kids could run round the track and stand on the podium. A nice museum which featured posters and torches from previous olympics and history of the event.

5 euros for adults, kids were free.

I returned the next morning early 0730/0800 to run a few laps when it is open to joggers.",February 2020,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great museum,"This modern building houses all the relics from the Acropolis site. The design of the building is very good and modern; it is set out like the Pathenon which gives a real sense of how the ancient site would’ve been.

Very good value, adults 5 euros, kids were free. There was a pack you could borrow for the kids to do a trail and look for things.",February 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Impressive,"The Acropolis can be seen wherever you are in Athens, however it is very impressive up close. Head to the museum also which complements the site.

We bought tickets for all the Sites which last 5 days, 30 Euros for adults and kids were free. These were good value.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Really good Museum,"This is a bit of a cross between the British Science and Natural History Museums. We spent the entire day there with our 6 and 10 year olds.

There’s a planetarium, aquarium, rain forest feature, earthquake simulator and lots of other things. At lunchtime there was a snake talk and the kids could handle the reptiles. This was a very informative and hands-on type of place. The building is modern spacious and well though out.

We took a packed lunch and there were tables to use. It’s a bit of a trek from San Fran centre, but easy to reach on the bus.

This place is fun but educational, with a focus on sustainability, recommended.",October 2019,California Academy of Sciences,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d117078-Reviews-California_Academy_of_Sciences-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
A must!,"We pre-booked our tickets about a month before we got to San Fran. We arrived at the pier 30 minutes before our departure time (10am). Queue was very orderly and boarding the vessel was straightforward. It was a short trip over to Alcatraz, there is no food or drink on the island so take some water etc.

You get an audio guide which directs you round the prison, you get a real sense of prison life and the commentary adds drama.

It’s a great place to visit, the kids loved it too!",October 2019,Alcatraz Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d102523-Reviews-Alcatraz_Island-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great place to stay,"This is a good location, near Union Square. Easy access to public transport, whether it’s the classic cable cars or bus and trams. Lots of restaurants nearby too.

We stayed on 7th floor in family room which was a decent size, quiet. Hotel was clean and staff helpful and friendly.

We used the pool, the kids liked it, although a little chilly!

Great Birthday meal,"We visited on Monday night for my mother’s birthday, we booked in advance which we were pleased about as the restaurant was busy and is obviously popular. We had two kids with us who ordered off the kids menu and were very pleased with their meals. The adults had a a three course meal and we were all happy with the tasty food served up, all with a friendly vibe from waiting staff.

Nice atmosphere, great food, friendly service!",August 2019,La Campagna Restaurant & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503807-d12716802-Reviews-La_Campagna_Restaurant_Bar-Stonehouse_Stroud_Stroud_District_Cotswolds_England.html,"Stonehouse, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Nice beach, shame about the dogs!","As you will see from my photo this is a lovely beach, a bit off the beaten track and consequently not too busy. We went as a group of 12, 6 adults with 6 children aged 6-10. It was a lovely day out, although the persistent yapping of dogs was an unwelcome annoyance. One of these hounds charged my niece leaving her skin scratched and her distressed! Twice the kids dug up buried dog waste, the selfish, arrogant attitude of dog owners is a topic I will not debate here, if they could be barred from this beach it may just be pushing five stars!

Jewell of a place!,"We visited St.Davids cathedral, the ‘City’ is very small and the cathedral is a real feature, we were stunned by its size.

Nice family holiday,"We rented a lodge for 12, 6 adults/6 kids. Accommodation was very clean and decent standard, good communal space with patio and picnic tables. No washing machine or bbq, we took a portable bbq.

There’s lots to do around Pembrokeshire, lovely beaches, castles etc. We went out on 6 of our 7 day stay. Laugharne, St. Davids and Tenby all worth a visit.

We went to the Blue Lagoon pool each day, 6pm was a less busy time.

The site is very hilly, we took bikes, but with hindsight I would’ve have. The kids found the hills hard work!

Nice place!",August 2019,Bluestone National Park Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3576019-d1112695-Reviews-Bluestone_National_Park_Resort-Canaston_Wood_Narberth_Pembrokeshire_Wales.html,"Canaston Wood, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0

Peaceful,We visited Laugharne whilst holidaying in the area. It’s a very peaceful place and the Boathouse is a calm relaxing space.

Nice spot,"We stayed here for two nights, dining in the brasserie on day one which was good value. It’s a lovely tranquil spot by the river and although East Mids airport is nearby I was not disturbed by aircraft noise. We had a great breakfast on the first morning which was cooked to order, strangely on day 2 it was a help yourself buffet which was not as nice but ok. Room was fine.",August 2018,The Priest House by the River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g499575-d249338-Reviews-The_Priest_House_by_the_River-Castle_Donington_Leicestershire_England.html,"Castle Donington, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
