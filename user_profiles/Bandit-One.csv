Fantastic new place,"This place here opened not long ago. Located on a more quiet side street, but still right in the center of Lucerne.

Offers freshly brewed coffee and a wonderful selection of fresh and packed Baklava from Syria/Turkey. They have boxes for a smaller budget or luxury boxes of Baklava. If you want just a few items, they got also a nice selection of single-packed Baklava as well as fresh ones to enjoy right now right there or to take-away.

We stumbled upon this new place just by accident. But what a lovely accident it was. The staff/owner really friendly, even offered some coffee. It's a smaller, but very nicely set coffee shop with really fair prices. Bought a box of Baklava, some single ones and some fresh Baklava. Ate some right at home. And wow, great quality. The ones in the box are of high quality, a nice selection with lots of different flavours.
The fresh Baklava were a real delight. Crispy, sweet and tasted like they have just been made. One was filled with some kind of fresh cheese. First time we've had that one. And surely will become one of our favourites quick. A real treat. Sorry I can't tell the names of the different pieces apart. Yet... but we will come back often, that will change quickly.

We are really happy that this place opened not far from home. Every bite takes you away from home quick, makes you feel like being on vacation for a moment. Really love this place. Hopefully it will stay for a long long time.",February 2021,Café Vista È Patisserie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188064-d23163652-Reviews-Cafe_Vista_E_Patisserie-Lucerne.html,"Lucerne, Switzerland",restaurants,5.0,5.0
A great portuguese bakery,"A great new place selling wonderful portuguese pastries (and more). And it's right in my hometown. How fantastic is that.

On one of the main streets through town you will find this wonderful Portuguese Bakery. A nice, modern set-up with a wonderful and friendly staff/owner.

Great portuguese pastries, sweets and more. Also selling salads, sandwiches and menus. Last time we even found some nice portuguese sausages here. They even told us how to prepare them in an authentic style. Loved it.

The pastries (sweet and/or savoury) are great. Handmade, homemade. Fresh, crispy, creamy. Also great cakes. The Pasteis/Pastels de Nata are a real treat. Better than most you can get in Portugal. Nice and crispy with a really good load of the wonderful egg custard. That's an item we always buy here - among other things. But hungry or not - a bunch of Pasteis de Nata are never wrong.

A fantastic bakery. Really lucky to have them here in this town. Been here a bunch of times know - with many more to come. Highly recommended.",February 2021,Bäckerei Pastelaria Paraíso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1079167-d23161539-Reviews-Backerei_Pastelaria_Paraiso-Emmen.html,"Emmen, Switzerland",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Very good lemon cake,"We've been here before and got some slices of their lemon cake. This time around we came back for a whole cake.

It's a really nice, very clean and modern set-up bakery. Staff is friendly and they got a nice selection of sweet pastry, chocolates, small and big breads, pies, cakes and more. Located in the sub-level of the Bern train station it has a great location, even though they also have other branches. But when changing trains, this location here is perfect to grab a snack.

The Lemon Cake - a whole one this time - was even better than the smaller pre-cut pieces we've had the first time. It is so lemony, I don't know how they pull it off, it tastes so great, not like any other lemon cake we know. And it's fresh, it's soft, it's moist. And you can keep it - even cut - for a couple of days and still tastes fresh.

Surely I will try some of their other items next time around. But the lemon cake we will definitely buy again. And so should you.",December 2020,Reinhard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188052-d23161512-Reviews-Reinhard-Bern_Bern_Mittelland_District_Canton_of_Bern.html,"Bern, Switzerland",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Wrong order,"Well, when in Zermatt McD isn't usually the place we eat at. I mean, nothing wrong with it, but there are lots of other options. But during Corona times most restaurants were closed and this one offered take away food for an ok price. When you go to McD you know what to expect. Or so we thought.

Ordered a Cheeseburger Royal, a McVeggie and some fries. All the orders are done by touch screen and with credit card only. Which is fine.

Got the order quick and walked away. It wasn't until later on in the train when we found out that the McVeggie wasn't a McVeggie. It was a McChicken. Not the end of the world, since we are (definitely) not vegetarians. But my wife quite likes the flavour of the McVeggie here. We didn't go back of course - that meant buying another two-way train ticket. Of course we should've checked our order. But we didn't. It's the first time that we got a wrong order at McD. And I assume that day there might have been a person biting in a ""McChicken"" only to find out it was a McVeggie - at least that thought makes me smile.

Nothing wrong with the food though. Fresh, hot, crispy fries. Burger as expected. All fine, just the wrong item.",December 2020,McDonalds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188098-d8534343-Reviews-McDonalds-Zermatt_Canton_of_Valais_Swiss_Alps.html,"Zermatt, Switzerland",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Busy but nice,"Even in times of Corona this part of the village was very busy. Hotel Restaurants are open only to hotel guests, all other restaurants closed. Except for Take Away, so many places changed their strategy and offer take away food.

But the shops were all still open at my time of visit, but outside on the street or inside the shops there was a mask requirement of course.

But that doesn't make this street less attractive. It's a relatively short stretch which leads through the heart of the old part of Saas Fee. Lots of souvenir shops, but also some nice independent store as well as a good number of bakeries, butchers and cheese shops. There are chain grocery stores in town as well, in case you need to stock up on some groceries.

It's just a charming part of Saas Fee, wonderful typical Valais-style buildings, most of the still inhabited, not just for show.",December 2020,Dorfstrasse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g198839-d23160570-Reviews-Dorfstrasse-Saas_Fee_Canton_of_Valais_Swiss_Alps.html,"Saas-Fee, Switzerland",attractions,5.0,5.0
Good chocolate,"Walked by this place and liked the look of the Pralinés displayed in their window. During Corona times this place is still open - at least the shop and for take away. The Café to sit down is closed right now.

We got a nice box of homemade chocolates for about 20 bucks. For that price we got 12 pieces. Ate them the within two days. And good news: Quality was very good. Every Praliné different. Even the one with Schnaps and a cherry inside was tasty (sorry, but the ""Mon Cherie"" brand Pralines aren't that good).

Good quality chocolate, nice presentation, made with love you could say. Worth the price, surely a place we would check some other products out on our next visit.",December 2020,Bäckerei-konditorei Bumann Ag,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g198839-d23159851-Reviews-Backerei_konditorei_Bumann_Ag-Saas_Fee_Canton_of_Valais_Swiss_Alps.html,"Saas-Fee, Switzerland",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Great ointments, fragrance oil and other specialty products","This shop here is still relatively new in Zermatt. Their window display looked interesting so we went in for a closer look.

And came out with a bag full of their products.

It's a great little shop. The ointments and creams from puralpina are fantastic. For sore muscles, for strains, pain etc. Smells good and works amazingly good. Bought some lip balm as well.

Also bought a good load of fragrance oil for a room nebulizer. And then some game meat sausages. I love game meat and these here are of great quality.

A fantastic shop with friendly staff/owner. There's no rush here and you can really enjoy checking out all their products. Prices might seem high at first, but the quality is great and we will definitely stick to their creams, balms and ointments. Luckily they got an online shop as well, since this branch here is a bit far away from home for a quick shopping.",December 2020,Puralpina Ag,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188098-d23157808-Reviews-Puralpina_Ag-Zermatt_Canton_of_Valais_Swiss_Alps.html,"Zermatt, Switzerland",attractions,5.0,5.0
A must-do,"Zermatt is a great place we always like to come back to. Even though full with visitors it still kept its charme over the decades. Most come to ski and just have a walk after or before doing so.

But when we come, we come for the village itself. There's so much to see and do and always a corner we missed last time. The main drag through the village is the famous Bahnhofstrasse and is surely the way to walk when you visit Zermatt for the first time. The street passes loads of interesting sights, shops, restaurants and cafés. It goes from the train station up until the oldest restaurant in town: DuPont, which has great food.

Some sights you shouldn't miss (starting from the train station): Bahnhofplatz, Hinterdorfstrasse, Grand Hotel Zermatterhof, St. Mauritius Church and just a few meters away: Mountaineer's Cemetery and the Kirchbrücke. The perfect photo op for the Matterhorn.

Lots of tourists shops are lined up here on this street of course. Also the big brands in fashion and watches. But also some butchers, grocery shops and small independent stores. Bring some time and check these out as well. We especially like the Puralpina Shop, which did open not long ago and for chocolate of course the Lindt Shop with some great deals.

For some lunch or dinner head to DuPont or the Brown Cow Pub. Both with great food for affordable prices.

Walking up and down this street is just a fun thing to do and we never get bored of it. When in Zermatt we to this daily. And great it's traffic free - but these electric taxis can be quite a bit annyoing, that's probably the only downside.",December 2020,Bahnhofstrasse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188098-d23159121-Reviews-Bahnhofstrasse-Zermatt_Canton_of_Valais_Swiss_Alps.html,"Zermatt, Switzerland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good on-sale deals,"Everybody knows Lindt of course. They're famous all over the world. And rightly so. And not only tourists go for Lindt, no Swiss people like me as well. They got some really good products, their selection is almost endless, so it's good if you know what you look for (chocolate bars, Lindor Kugeln, squares, Pralines etc.).

We just went in to have a look around, but ended up buying a good load of their products. Lindor Kugeln are great, they come in many flavours. Bought a mixed bag of them and two bags of Chocolate/Mint flavour. The latter were even 50% off, because of the expiry date.

Then they had some new products: The Squares. Like mini-chocolate bars with a creamy filling. Great for just one bite. They come in Hazelnut, Dark Orange or Caramel flavour. We bought on bag of each. The Dark Orange was our favourite, so we bought two more bags the other day. A great new addition to the huge Lindt selection.

Staff was very nice and friendly. There's no rush or push to buy. Right now you can't really sample anything because of Covid-19. But then again almost all of their products are tasty.

A good shopping experience. And great if you can catch some of their 50%-off products. Good deals to find here.",December 2020,Lindt Chocolate Shop Zermatt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188098-d10000679-Reviews-Lindt_Chocolate_Shop_Zermatt-Zermatt_Canton_of_Valais_Swiss_Alps.html,"Zermatt, Switzerland",attractions,5.0,4.5
A nice and easy walking trail,"Täsch is just between Zermatt and the lovely village of Randa. Many just use it as a base to go skiing or pass it on the way to Zermatt.

But if you got a little time on your hands, be sure to spend a while here. There is a wonderful trail going along the river. Especially in winter it's a magical place.

Easiest way to access is to walk from the train station a bit north, then there's a small bridge crossing the river near the Camping Site Alphubel.

It's a very easy walk and not really busy at all, which is a surprise because it's a great little walk. It's mostly very flat, so suitable for almost everybody. They take care of this trail very well, it even can be done if you have a stroller with (and a bit extra strength to push).

Follow the trail to the small Schalisee (Lake Schali) where you can cross the bridge and go back to Täsch on the other side. Or just follow the same way back. The trail does continue though. You could walk all the way to Randa.

A beautiful trail through Winterwonderland. A nice and quiet escape from the busy (but fun) streets of Zermatt.",December 2020,Rundwanderung Täsch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g198846-d23157773-Reviews-Rundwanderung_Tasch-Tasch_Canton_of_Valais_Swiss_Alps.html,"Täsch, Switzerland",attractions,5.0,5.0
A good stop before crossing the border,"Don't let Google StreetView fool you, this place is now an Autogrill with a Tamoil gas station.

And that's a good thing, since most Autogrill branches have a good standard. Good news: This is one of them.

Before crossing the border and going back home, we wanted to stock up on some olive oil and salami and to grab some quick lunch.

Ordered a hot Mortadella Focaccia. Looked a bit flat and tired, but tasted very good.
Found some good deals on salami and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It's not the best Salami you'll ever eat, but it's great value. The Olive Oil on the other hand though is a favourite of ours (Il Casolare Biologico). Great stuff.

There are nice, clean and free restrooms as well and the Tamoil gas station next to, in case your car is thirsty.

Another good Autogrill, we liked it.",October 2020,Autogrill Lario Est,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1202905-d12438521-Reviews-Autogrill_Lario_Est-Cadorago_Province_of_Como_Lombardy.html,"Cadorago, Italy",restaurants,4.0,2.5
Pretty good desserts,"Usually we buy desserts and sweets in our favourite bakery/pasticceria in Venice: Dal Mas. But Rizzo has some good-looking (mini-)cakes that looked worth trying.

So we bought some pistachio cake, a tiramisu (shaped like a swiss-roll) and an almond cake. Service was quick, prices fair.

The Tiramisu was pretty good, th pastachio cake quite excellent. The Almond cake on the other hand was a bit of a let-down. Soaked in sirup a bit too much for our taste and lacked a bit of almond flavour - despite being an actual almond cake.

But two out of three is still solid. Pizza looked very good as well, something we'll try next time. But for sweets and cakes we still will probably stick to our favourite place: Dal Mas.",October 2020,Rizzo Pane,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d10763046-Reviews-Rizzo_Pane-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Truffle Honey and Olive Oil,"Came in here on our last day in Venice. Looked for some more Truffle products as well as some good olive oil.

It's a smaller shop, but filled with all the good stuff. Friendly owner, no rush or push.

Bought some jars with truffle honey (big and small) from just 7 Euros to 20 Euros a jar. Then a few bottles of Extra Virgin Olive Oil - from some smaller producers. Always fun to try new olive oil. And these we bought here tasted great when we used them at home. Prices very fair from 8 to 20 Euros a bottle.

They sell a lot of their fresh and dried pasta as well. Looked very good, but we just didn't have much more space to carry. Maybe next time.

A nice little independent shop. Great quality products.",October 2020,Giacomo Rizzo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d544349-Reviews-Giacomo_Rizzo-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.0
Love their truffle honey,"When we're in Italy we always make sure to bring some Truffle products home. In Tuscany these products are everywhere, but also in Venice you can find several shops with Truffle items.

This one here is on one of the main drags in Venice (also has another branch a bit further south in Venice), so if you explore the city by foot there's a high chance you will pass this shop.

It seems a bit touristy at first, but the products are very good, staff friendly (no push) and the prices fair.

We bought some Mushroom&Truffle Sauce, Milliefiori Honey with Truffle, Olive Oil with Truffle Slices and Acacia Honey with Truffle. Prices - depending on the size - between 10 and 25 Euros each. Which is fine. We really enjoy their products, as well as our family members at home (we brought some products for them).

Be sure to try this one at home: A slice of Baguette, spread some cream cheese like Philadelphia on top, one or two slices of (smoked) salmon on that and then pour the truffle honey over it. A great little starter/meal.",October 2020,La Bottega del Tartufo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d15759846-Reviews-La_Bottega_del_Tartufo-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.0
Full of little gadgets and things,"This is a fun shop. Full of things you never knew you (don't) need. Kitchen and bathroom gadgets, brushes, cell-phone holders, fans, cups, bottles, watches, soap dispensers, aprons, kitchen timers, pens, hooks, glasses cases, bags, champagne glasses...

The list goes on and on. You really need some time to dig through the products. And even you think you don't need any of these items, you're wrong. You will probably walk out with something. It's just a fun shop. And so colourful, it looks like a rainbow exploded in here.

Staff is very nice, lets customers take their time without pushing. In the end we bought some items too. Two cellphone holders and some pens. Nothing we really needed, but needed them anyways.

Came for a quick snack,"We were walking around town all day on this nice and sunny day. Had some lunch already but felt like having a quick snack and some Aperol Spritz. Found this place with some tables outside on a more quiet street (at least at that time).

Ordered two Aperol Spritz (a good load), some grilled shrimp, bacalau, sea snails and some oysters.
All the seafood was really fresh, the oysters and sea snails tasted great. Two wonderful items.
The shrimp I have to say were grilled a bit too long - they were quite dry - and weren't hot anymore. Not much flavour.

Staff was nice, prices very very fair, the place felt relaxed, a nice spot to grab a quick bite. The Octopus looked very good as well. Something to try next time when we're in Venice.",October 2020,I Compari Pulperia a Venezia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d15265507-Reviews-I_Compari_Pulperia_a_Venezia-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.5
A nice and quiet canal,"This here is a nice little side-canal. Busy in times of Carnevale, but at other times a nice change of pace from the busy neighbourhoods (at least when we mostly visit in fall).

A good starting point to a little round trip is the wonderful Ponte delle Guglie. Follow either side of this smaller canal: the Fondamenta Cannaregio or the Fondamenta Venier. Follow the canal up to the small but impressive Ponte di Tre Archi. You could keep walking until you hit the open water or cross the bridge and walk back on the other side of the canal - back to your starting point. Especially later in the evening this canal is very quiet - except for the folks enjoying their drinks and cicchetti in the several bars & restaurants.

After two days of medium rain the canal was rising up quite some and already started to hit the Fondamenta on both sides. All other canals were still fine. I imagine this will be one of the first side streets to be flooded when that season comes.

But it's a nice little canal, lined with lots of interesting restaurants that we will check out next time in Venice (the Trattoria Bar Pontini and the Casa Bonita and the Ristorante Agli Archi all looked promising).",October 2020,Fondamenta Cannaregio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d17528366-Reviews-Fondamenta_Cannaregio-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Never fails to amaze,"We have been in Venice a bunch of times. But still amazes us the same as the first time. It's just a lovely place to be. Countless sights, great food and no (car) traffic.
The Canale Grande is one of the most famous sights in the city. And rightly so. You could rent a private water taxi, take a tour boat or just hop on one of the water buses. For us the water bus was fine. Drive along the whole canale or hop and off (buy a day-ticket). You will pass endless interesting sights. Starting from the train station (Ferrovia) the Ponte degli Scalzi, the Chiesa di San Simeon Piccolo, the Chiesa di San Geremia, Rialto Mercato and Rialto Bridge, the Ponte dell’Accademia, the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute, the Punta della Dogana and at the other end the Piazza San Marco with the Palazzo Ducale and the Basilica di San Marco. And that's just the very big sights along the way.

Of course you also can walk through Venice (we love it) and you will pass the Canale lots of times. It's also fun just to wander around without plan and getting lost in the beautiful backstreets of Venice.

This time we were lucky to rent an apartement for a few day directly on the Canale Grande. With views of the canal from every room. Be it in the morning during breakfast or in the evenings when the lights on the canal seemed magical: We never got and never will get bored of that sight. Light or dark, day or night, sunny or rainy.

Nice cicchetti - great spleen,"Just walked around Venice on the way back to our apartement when we stumbled upon this place. Feelilng a bit hungry we walked in. Our Bulldog was welcome as well.

It's a relatively new place, quite a modern setting, only a few tables inside. But it's a charming little restaurant/bar with a nice and helpful staff/owner.

Ordered some of their tasty looking Cicchetti: one with blue cheese, one with salami, one with melted cheese and one with a bacalau cream. They all tasted very good, but maybe I would have used white bread instead. But the toppings and the quality were right.

But the best of all: they serve spleen! This simple-looking item became one of our favorite little dishes here in Venice. We've had it before at another place and tried it here as well. And: tasted great! It seems simple. You cook up some spleen, slice it and put it in vinegar with some spices and/or onions. Eat it cold like that or on some bread. It's a fantastic snack. Smoother and easier on your tongue than liver. We love it and mastered to cook it at home since our visit.

If you visit this place here, be sure to try it out. Might not have the looks, but tasted wonderful (even if you're not into offal).

What we really enjoyed about this place was the wine. They have a really nice selection of tasty Italian wines.

Well... a lot changed,"We came to this restaurant a few times in the past 2-3 years. Despite other negative feedback we ended up always happy with both the food and the staff. We mostly come in fall...maybe better than in the high season.

So naturally we came back for dinner here this fall. But boy, did we get disappointed this time.
Staff was fine though, but they didn't seem too happy. Of course 2020 has taken its toll or/and they knew that their standard has dropped.

One could see by the looks of the main dishes that this wasn't prepared by the same cook as the other times we came. And the lack of any flavour just confirmed it.
The starter - fried seafood - was a big let-down already. Soggy and bland. It's hard to mess up a fried dish, but they surely did.
Lobster pasta and Spaghetti Vongole for the main. Bland sauce, cheap-quality vongole and just no flavours at all. Where's the seafood broth where the pasta should've been cooked in? And then every Italian's nightmare: the pasta was overcooked. And if you overcook pasta in Italy you have clearly lost. I don't know who's in the kitchen, but every real Italian wouldn't...well COULDN'T mess pasta up that badly.
The wine was ok, a bit pricey, but that wasn't news.

Another good Autogrill,"Autogrill is part of the fun when we are on the road in Italy. The standard is mostly quite high - with some few exception. Luckily this is not one these exceptions.

This Autogrill has a good standard. The setting is like most other branches. A free and clean restroom, a restaurant / take away with good fast food items as well as whole menus. Coffee and pastries also.
Then there's the shop. Lots of good stuff. A good chance to stock up on some ham and salami, wine, beer and Prosecco. Always a good deal. Also don't miss out on their olive oil deals.

We grabbed a Mortadella Focaccia, a coffee and a pistachio-cream croissant. As ususal very good stuff. Prices fair. Also some green area outside for your four-legged friend. Gas station (IP) right next to. Some parking spots are covered....in case of a hot day.

Fantastic Whole Jamon,"Ordered a whole Spanish Jamon here twice. Once a front leg ""Cebo de Campo Paleta 5kg"" for 220.- and once the ""Tierra Húmeda Ibérico 7.5kg-8kg"" back leg.

Delivery and payment was both easy and quick. I am a real lover of spanish Jamon. One of the things I've always missed about Spain. But I can't always go to Spain whenever I feel like having Jamon. So I tried some sliced Jamon from different shops and also some whole legs. They were all pretty good, but not more.

Then I found this shop here online and ordered. Prices are really fair. And boy, is the quality great. Both pieces are very different in taste. But both equally good. Now I can have Jamon whenever I want. And that's about 4-5 times a week. Doesn't have to be much. I just slice a few pieces of the leg. The Iberico pork is so full of flavour, A great texture, nice colour and the right balance between meat and (tasty) fat. A nice age to it. It's like candy to me. Just better.

Definitely not the last time I've ordered here. Now I can have Jamon all year.

Very good sandwich,"Between changing trains we grabbed some late breakfast here. Ordered an Espresso Doppio, a butter croissant and a planted chicken Sandwich.

They got a lot of interesting items on the menu. Salad, soups, wraps, coffees, Poké Bowls, smoothies, sweets and of course the sandwiches.

Coffee was brewed by order. Nice flavour, hot and strong. Price - for the Bern trainstation - fair. Staff was friendly.

The croissant was worth the money as well, crispy and fresh.

Saved the best for last. The sandwich was really a thing to enjoy. Nicely stuffed, fresh ingredients of high quality. Good dressing, fresh bread. Despite being quite big, it was not feeling too heavy, which was good, since it was still morning and not lunchtime yet. It was a vegeterian option, mostly I go for meat, but for breakfast it was perfect. The mustard-agave dressing a perfect match for the other fresh and crunchy ingredients.

Costs a buck or two more than what you would pay in a grocery store. But it's good, it's fresh, it's tasty. Worth the money. Felt a bit like ""Pret-A-Manger"" if you know that chain.

As usual: great selection of wine and liquor,"Signorvino has branches in all major Italian cities and also malls. It's a great wine shop / wine bar / restaurant. Interesting menu with good quality food items. But also a great place to shop some wine and liquor.

This time we only needed some wine. As usual for Signorvino the interior is classy and stylish. Feels warm and cosy. Lots of great wine and liquor on display. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.

Bought some Tommasi Amarone and Limoncello ""Il Convento"" (that's the best Limoncello we've ever had, we always come back here for this one). And then a bottle of Allegrini Amarone. It costs a bit more (around 50-60 Euros a bottle) but it's one of the best Amarone we know. Highly enjoyable.

Good quality food,"On a little side street, not far from the Anfiteatro, we found this place. Weather was nice, so we sat down at a table outside. Our Bulldog was very welcome as well.

This restaurant here care very much about the environment and uses biodegradable and compostable dishes, which is really a good thing. Also they use corn starch utensils and cups and cellulose napkins. And the (very good) tap water is puarified and served in glass bottles. Free.

Staff here was very very friendly. There was no rush, no push. We really had a great time enjoying their dishes. Since we weren't that hungry we just ordered the Tagliere Toscano (tuscan appetizers) and pheasant stew. A glass of white wine each. As a free starter we got a mix of bread and tomato. Didn't look special, but was actually very tasty.

The pheasant stew was nice and tender. Looked dry, but actually wasn't. A good dish. The Tagliere Toscano was great. Prosciutto, Salami and Pecorino. All of very good quality. The Crostini were nice as well. The chicken liver being my favourite.

All in all a good meal. Fair priced. Nice staff. The only thing that could be improved was the glass of wine. It was really just more of a shot instead of a glass. Other tables got the same amount, which was really quite not much. If we knew we would have ordered a bottle. I don't expect a full to the rim glass of wine. But a bit more.

Still, a very good option to have some lunch or dinner. Good quality food.",August 2020,Allabona Lucca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187898-d14177837-Reviews-Allabona_Lucca-Lucca_Province_of_Lucca_Tuscany.html,"Lucca, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good priced Gelato,"This is a Café with lots of tables outside, overlooking the beautiful Basilica on the Piazza San Michele. So it surely has a great location.

We didn't come for coffee and desserts, we just bought some ice cream to go at their Gelateria counter.

Prices were really good, especially given the prominent location. Bought two cups with a scoop of Mint/Chocolate and Amarena Cherry.

We had lots of gelato on this Road Trip through Italy. From great to forgettable. This one here was not the very best, but quite enjoyable. Could have been a bit thicker and creamier. But the flavours were very nice. Mint/Chocolate and Amarena Cherry are our favourites and these here were pretty good.

Great specialty food items,"Before heading home we picked up some good specialties here in this shop. Staff was very nice and friendly, helped us finding what we looked for.

Bought a bunch of bottles of local (and other Italian) Olive Oil. Some cheaper ones and some higher priced quality. But both were of really good quality, taste and flavour. Gotta love Italian Olive Oil. Then some nice salami. Really good, far from being mass-produced. Then some jams and chutneys - they go very well with Italian cheese.

A very nice shop. Prices might seem a bit higher. But this is not a chain shop. This one really has great, special food items not easily found at other shops. And definitely worth the money.",August 2020,Il Mercatino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187898-d23128492-Reviews-Il_Mercatino-Lucca_Province_of_Lucca_Tuscany.html,"Lucca, Italy",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Nice men's wear,"On this Road Trip through Italy I kept an eye open for some nice Italian-style vests. Never really found any interesting offers. Either the quality was too low or the prices too high. Been in malls, outlets, independent shops.

And then, almost at the end of our trip I got lucky. Found this shop here with some good offers (half price) on Italian-made vests. One brown, one black. They fit nicely and the quality is right. Cost 40 Euros each, which I found to be a good deal. Wanted to buy more, but these two were all they had in my size. Too bad.

Nice selection of wine,"Before leaving this wonderful town we were looking for a good bottle of wine for dinner. This Enoteca here is located right at the famous Piazza San Michele, so you almost can't miss it.

There's a nice bar inside or tables outside. A nice selection of local and other Italian wines. Friendly staff, prices fair.

I looked for some Amarone. Buglioni, Tommasi, Allegrini, all favourites we know of. But I felt like trying a new one. The Amarone Speri was my choice in the end.

A nice, old-school classic Amarone. Price a bit above 50 Euros a bottle. A fair deal, we really enjoyed the bottle with and after dinner.

So, if you look for some good wine and don't wanna head out to some chain store, then this Enoteca is a good choice.",August 2020,Enoteca Marsili Lucca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187898-d6813336-Reviews-Enoteca_Marsili_Lucca-Lucca_Province_of_Lucca_Tuscany.html,"Lucca, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
A nice walk,"Lucca a pretty historic town. Full of interesting sights. And one of the things to do is walking the streets. Lucca has lots of nice walking and shopping lanes.
And this here is one of the most famous ones.
All the big brands are here (like Timberland, Max Mara, Kiko, Guess, Douglas, Foot Locker, Swatch etc.). But even you're not into shopping you shouldn't miss out on this street. It's a nice little walk, passing the Torre Delle Ore. It goes from the Piazza San Michele up to the beautiful Anfiteatro. And just for that alone it's worth having a walk here.

Nice Basilica and Piazza,"This is the heart of this incredibly beautiful old town. And right in this heart sits the amazing San Michele in Foro. An impressive Roman Catholic Basilica first mentioned in the year 795 (!!) and rebuilt in 1070. You are looking at a history of well over 1000 years here.

The facade is really detailed and so is the impressive tower. It's definitely one of the most beautiful Basilicas we've ever encountered.

Around the piazza there are lots of shops, cafés, restaurants, gelaterias etc.

We bought some good wine at Enoteca Marsili Lucca and had some decent Gelato at the Café Casali.

An amazing historic Amphitheatre,"This spot is a must-see when in Lucca. It's actually an old roman amphitheatre and held up to 10'000 spectators back in its time. After the Roman downfall it wasn't used as such anymore and was falling apart partly. In the end being used just for salt storage.

Luckily in the 19th Century it was being rebuilt to what it is today. The shape is still visible as are some parts of the old Amphitheatre. Now it's a lively spacious square with lots of restaurants and cafés and shops. Since 2006 together with the old town of Lucca part of the UNESCO world heritage.

It's fun to have a walk around the Anfiteatro, sitting down and having a drink, watching the world go by.

An amazing town,"Lucca is one of the most beautiful old Italian towns we've visited. It's really up there with Florence, Bologna, Rome etc.

But since the old town center is quite compact, it's perfect to explore it completely by foot.Easy to navigate, easy to get to, easy to park. It's a ZTL Zone, so you gotta drop your car outside the city walls (the Parcheggio Palatucci is a good option - and still free of charge during Covid-19).

You enter the old city through one of the gates in the beautiful city walls with the moat surrounding the town. If coming from the biggest parking lot, you'll be entering through Porta San Donato. The walls and the gate being two of the first sights you'll see. And there are so many sights and landmarks in this amazing historic town. Don't miss out on the Torre Delle Ore, the Chiesa di San Giusto, the Palazzo Pfanner, the fantastic Piazza dell'Anfiteatro, the Basilica di San Frediano and the Piazza Napoleone. And of course the heart of the city: the Piazza San Michele with the breathtaking Chiesa di San Michele in Foro.
Besides that take some walks on these streets and lanes: Via S. Paolino, Via Pozzotorelli, Via Santa Lucia, Via Beccheria, Via Del Moro and Via Fillungo.

Otherwise it's also fun, to just wander around and to get lost a bit in this old city. Not much can happen, somewhen you will reach the city walls, then you can navigate your way back to whereever you planned.

We enjoyed our day here. Great buildings, churches and architecture. Good food as well. Interesting shops and nice bakeries. The town feels relaxed and laid back. Even in Corona times you can forget about what's all going on in the world for a while.

Nice to visit a traffic-free town (besides some delivery cars and trucks). Even ""Top Gear"" (back when it was good) was here once. We loved it.",August 2020,Centro storico,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187898-d14994430-Reviews-Centro_storico-Lucca_Province_of_Lucca_Tuscany.html,"Lucca, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
A good rest stop,"Heading west to the other side of Italy we stopped here for lunch. We were ahead of time and had some extra hours to kill.

This Autogrill is a pretty big one. Stretching over both sides of the Highway, so you can enjoy some nice traffic views during lunch.

The restaurant is big and there are a lot of lunch options. Sandwiches, Pizza, Burgers, Chicken, Buffett, salad Buffett etc. and set menus.

We ordered a big grilled meat combo plate with salad and drinks. Nicely grilled chicken, sausages and other items. Nice grill flavour, not to dry either. Meat quality was pretty good as well. And good-priced.

The shop downstairs was fun too. Autogrill always has some good deals. Mostly we go for some Prosecco and Olive Oil. It's great value.

Everything you need is on site here. Restaurant, clean restrooms, a shop, gas station, picknick tables, some green spots in case your pet needs a break as well. Lots of parking spaces.

Good fish and seafood,"We were so busy walking along the canals and enjoying the nice sights in the town that we almost forgot it was way past lunchtime.

Most restaurants were closed already for lunch or would soon close. We asked the owner here and they indeed still served lunch. Friendly owner, friendly staff. Our Bulldog Girl was welcome as well.
We took a table outside with nice canal views. Ordered two glasses of local white wine (good taste - good price), Curry Shrimp Gnocchi and a plate of grilled fish & Seafood.

The Gnocchi were nice, cooked perfectly. Nice presentation as well. But even better was the fish & seafood plate. Grilled whole fish fillet, squid, shrimp, mussels, a scallop. And - the specialty of the region - eel!
All great - all fresh - all tasty. The eel very very good as well.

Honest, good down-to-earth homecooking. Really enjoyed it.

Nice spot,"A very nice bridge in an even nicer town.

Built from 1631-1635, this bridge here is a great spot. Be it for the Chiesa dei SS.Pietro e Paolo just next to it or the view of the Treponti. It's a really great photo op.

The bridge is named after the inmates of the nearby prisons at that time.

Great piece of architecture,"Comacchio is a beautiful small town. Despite the compact center there are plenty of interesting sights.
The most famous one is the bridge ""Trepponti"". Depending on where you parked, this is the bridge you will cross to get into the Historic Center. And it's an interesting bridge. Not just by the style and architecture. It's also special because it's a bridge that spreads over not just one, but two canals on each side.So it's ""three-legged"" so to say. Three - Tre.

Built in 1638 this bridge soon will be 400 years old. And it's still in wonderful shape. Some changes and improvements were made of course over the centuries.

A great sight. Surely not to be missed when visiting Comacchio.",August 2020,Trepponti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g676117-d5796400-Reviews-Trepponti-Comacchio_Province_of_Ferrara_Emilia_Romagna.html,"Comacchio, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
A lovely town,"Comacchio still seems to be a well-kept secret. Despite the beauty of it, visitors only gather here in small numbers. Even though it's so pretty, easy to get to and with lots of free parking lots in walking distance.

Comacchio with its canals feels like the little sister of Venice. Everything is a little smaller here. Less canals, less churches and historical buildings. And - like I said before - also less visitors. But that shouldn't hold you back from visiting this little gem.

It's nice to walk the streets and lanes of the old town. A good number of restaurants along the canal, souvenir shops and also specialty food shops. The specialty here is definitely the eel.

The Chiesa dei SS.Pietro e Paolo, the Via Edgardo Fogli, the Via Ludovico Muratori, the Via Della Pescheria, the Chiesa del Carmine, the Torre Civica, the Ponte degli Sbirri and of course the famous Trepponti Di Comacchio are all wonderful sights and all very close together in this compact historic center.

It's also nice to just follow the canals to some more quiet parts of the old town. Always some nice historic building to discover.

There is a huge free parking lot in walking distance, just next to the Coop grocery store where you also will find a free public restroom.

We had some lunch at the Trottoria Del Borgo. Most places closed after lunch. This one was still open and offered very good homecooked meals. Dog-friendly as well.

A wonderful little town. If you want to enjoy a town with history, lots of photo ops and good food and still don't want it to be overcrowded, then this is the place.

A great shopping experience,"After a day in Bologna we took a little detour to the Woolrich Outlet Store. We know the brand. Quality is great - but so are the prices. At least in my country.

We were hoping for some good deals here in Italy, but didn't want to expect too much.

Located on a quiet street in the middle of what feels like an industrial area. But then after you walk through the doors of the almost hidden store you enter shopping heaven.

They got all kinds of clothes and accessories. In all colours. For women and men. For all seasons. We came for the winter section, since it can get quite cold here in Switzerland. And Woolrich is just made for that (and more).
Of course there are the last-season stocks, but you also can get the timeless classic editions and the current lines.
Items from the past season are very very well priced. My wife bought one coat, I got one jacket. Hers for 300 Euros, mine for only 270 Euros. Market price was over 700 Euros each. Then another jacket. From the current production line. They told us it would be ""normal"" priced. We were in for a suprise to see it was only 500 Euros. Here at my home it would have been about 900 Euros.

Staff was extremely helpful, friendly, polite. Let us take our time to dress, to think, to talk. And even our English Bulldog was very welcome and happy to be able to come with. Shop is nicely set, lots of space, spotless clean. Restrooms as well.

Walked out with three items for a little over 1000 Euros. Saved about 1500 Euros - if bought here at home.

A fantastic shop. Definitely will be back.

It's ok for walk,"After walking through the compact old center of Bologna, some good shopping and an even better lunch we headed onto this mainstreet for a quick walk.

And it feels like another world right away. You just jumped a few centuries forward in time. It's a main street, lined with shops, restaurants and more. Could be in Barcelona, could be London, could even be NYC. Big main streets are all similar. Chain stores, banks, chain restaurants.

But still, it was quite fun to walk up and down this street. Terranova is a nice fashion shop and in ""Oggi"" you can get some really nice Gelato. The Mercato Delle Erbe was a bit underwhelming. I've seen better indoor mercatos.

Still, if you want a change from the historic center and miss some window shopping on a main street or if you just have some time to kill in Bologna, you should check this street here out.",August 2020,Via Ugo Bassi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187801-d12214070-Reviews-Via_Ugo_Bassi-Bologna_Province_of_Bologna_Emilia_Romagna.html,"Bologna, Italy",attractions,3.0,4.0
Good food - good fun,"Bologna is a nice town with a suprisingly compact historic Center. So it's easy to reach most sights by foot.
Whenever you get hungry, you should head here to the Via Pescherie Vecchie - a small but bustling food lane in old town Bologna.
On this small stretch of street lots of people gather to grab some food and even more so for some drinks. It's fun, it's lively - even in Corona-times.
But also the quality is right. Restaurants look good and so do the shops. Some - like this one here - are two in one: a specialty shop as well as a restaurant.

This place here was a great choice. Took one of their high tables outside, where our Bulldog was welcome as well.

Ordered a plate of cured ham, mortadella and Burrata. Some mushroom antipasti on the side. Two glasses of red wine with that.

Staff was very friendly, helped us choose some good, local wine. Presentation of the food very stylish, quite the looker. Quality of the meat was very good. Burrata and meat goes very well together. If you never had Burrata (Mozzarellas creamier and milkier brother/sister), then you should really try some. The one served here is of very good quality.
The red wine was delicious. Not just cheap table wine. Enjoyed every sip. The shop inside is full with good stuff. (Cured) Ham, Salami, pasta, oil, antipasti etc. A tasty looking place.

Only had one - but it was a great one,"We've had our share of Gelato during our 5-week Road Trip through Italy this year. Few were great, some good - and a good number just ok.

We didn't really feel like Gelato that day. But when we saw ""foglie di basilico"" on the list we had to try it. Since the best Gelato this year was unusual as well (Ricotta).

The menu is big, there are lots of interesting flavours. Prices - for this quality - really fair. Staff friendly.

The foglie di basilico was a great choice. It wasn't overpowering. But still you clearly tasted the Basil. It's difficult to find the balance to make it just right. And they surely did.

Great Piazza,"Bologna is surely one of the big cities to visit in Italy. The old town is actually quite compact and many sights are very close to each other.

The heart is definitely this square: The Piazza Maggiore. The Palazzo Comunale, the Palazzo d’Accursio, the impressive Fontana del Nettuno, the Palazzo dei Banchi, the Santuario di Santa Maria della Vita, the Voltone and the breathtaking Basilica di San Petronio. All here. Just on one square. Most other towns wouldn't have that many sights altogether. And Bologna has just that many on one single square.

It's a fantastic spot. From here you should check out the Via D'Azeglio, the main street Via Ugo Bassi/Via Rizzoli with many shops and the Via Pescherie Vecchie with lots of wonderful restaurants. Especially the latter is a small little street you shouldn't miss.

The tourist office is also located here as well as a good number of shops and cafés. Head to the Via Pescherie Vecchie for some lunch or dinner though. If you need some wine, ""Signorvino"" is a great chain with good wine and knowledgeable staff. There is a branch just here on the Piazza.

Nice landmarks,"We just came for a quick look. We had our Bulldog with, so we didn't climb up (at least I have an excuse).

But even from the ground the two Towers are quite the sight. Well, the Asinelli Tower is a bit more impressive, with just a little short of 100m in height.
The Garisenda Tower is interesting as well though, mostly because it is quite visibly slanting. Talking about a leaning tower.

Passed this Gelateria and got a scoop of Crema and a scoop of Nocciola.

We had some really good Ice Cream on this Road Trip. Best one in Cinque Terre (Vernazza) and some very very good one in Torre Pali (Puglia). This one here belongs definitely in the top three.

Most shops here are some small, independent stores. Which is nice. Clothes, household products, perfume. Then a good number of restaurants, cafés and Gelaterias.

Nice location - good seafood,"This is a restaurant with a really nice location. Close to the beach at the ocean, with views of the Borgo Antico.
Lots of tables outside, where our Bulldog was welcome as well. Staff is really friendly and helpful. Made us feel really welcome.

Of course - given its name - it's all about fish and seafood. Even though there are non-seafood on the menu as well.

We ordered some fried seafood and shrimp Gnocchi. Then we found out that they serve ""crudo"" - raw seafood - as well. Since we are so thrilled about crudo since we've eaten some plates in the amazing ""Al Trabucco Da Mimi"" close to Peschici, we needed to have some here. Ordered two plates. Langoustines, shrimp big and small, oysters and sea urchins. Some lemon with (they also got Tabasco if you like).

Ordered some water and a glass of White Wine with.

Prices are fair. Ok, crudo cost a bit more, but still good value.

The fried seafood was a safe bet. Fresh and crispy. A good meal. The Gnocchi were a bit bland, nothing special. Wouldn't have that again.
The crudo was very good. Langoustines fresh and sweet. Also great sea urchins. Shrimp and oysters were better at the other restaurant I wrote about. It's still very good crudo here. If it wasn't for the outstanding experience at the other place, then this might get five stars. But since I need to compare and I've given the other one five stars, I can give this place here only four. But it's a strong four. A really good option for some good seafood.

Small - but quite nice,"Italy is full of wonderful old towns. We've seen many and always like to find some new Centro Storicos or Borgo Anticos.

Compared to many other towns, Termoli has a quite small old center. The location is quite beautiful though. Sitting on top of a hill, overlooking the ocean. You can walk all around the historic center, all with sea and port views. Inside the old center there is honestly not that much to see and do. Not just because of Corona. There are just not that many shops or restaurants. Only a handful. It was nice to walk around the small area anyways. But compared to other Historic Center it's quite a quick walk.

Still, landmarks like the Castello Svevo with the Belvedere della Torretta, the Cathedral of Saint Mary 'della Purificazione and the Piazza Duomo makes the visit worth a drive.

Ok - no more,"This place boasts a great location on the busy Lungomare. It's a bar/café. But we came here twice for some take-out Gelato. There's a more popular Gelateria almost next door, but that one didn't convice us. Neither did this one.

We might be complicated customers and not easy to please when it comes to Gelato. The right balance between creaminess, flavour and texture is important. Found two great Gelaterias on this Italian Road Trip. This one not being one of them. But since we didn't find a better one around, we came here anyways. They have a good number of different flavours. Prices are low, staff is nice and friendly. But the Gelato just average. A bit too watery. Flavours not so strong.

Too heavy,"We love Italian Gelato. There seems to be a Gelateria on every corner or so anywhere in Italy. And there lies the problem. They can't be all great...and they aren't. A great Italian Gelator has a great balance between creaminess, flavour and texture. In the Cinque Terre we found the best Gelato yet (Ricotta flavour). In Torre Pali (Puglia) we found another outstanding Gelateria.

This place here is really busy. There's usually a huge line around lunch and dinner time. So naturally we had to try some. Went for a scoop of hazelnut and a scoop of ""Cremino"". And no doubt, they put a lot of effort and work into their creative Gelato. This is definitely not a mass production, but the work of some passionate Gelato creators. And a lot of customers love their ice cream.

But for us it was too much on the heavy side. It was so thick and creamy it didn't even ever start to melt. The flavours were totally outmatched by the heavy cream. It didn't feel like Gelato, more of some new kind of dessert they created with their (double??) cream. Really not bad. But just not our style. But you should give it a try anyways, it's definitely different than any other Gelato.",August 2020,Gelateria RivaReno Montesilvano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g194834-d17388615-Reviews-Gelateria_RivaReno_Montesilvano-Montesilvano_Province_of_Pescara_Abruzzo.html,"Montesilvano, Italy",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"Good bread and coffee, Great cherry cream puffs","We passed this place every day when we were on the way to the Lungomare. Sometimes we bought some desserts to eat later at home, sometimes we sat down at one of their tables outside. Our Bulldog was welcome as well.

They serve very good coffee and have great bread and pastries. Chocolate cornettos were great. But even more so the Cream Puffs with Amarena Cherries. These were just divine. They also sell few grocery items like milk and water. They even got wine and Prosecco to shop.

Staff is friendly, prices are low. Quality is high. A great little bakery with good products. To sit down, take out or bring home.",August 2020,La Bottega Del Pane,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g194834-d23064049-Reviews-La_Bottega_Del_Pane-Montesilvano_Province_of_Pescara_Abruzzo.html,"Montesilvano, Italy",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Great Promenade,"Montesilvano is an underrated Italian town. There is more than meets the eye at first. There are good restaurants, nice shops along the busy main roads, a very nice beach, markets almost daily on the streets in the summertime. And then there is this beautiful promenade here.

It goes for miles and miles, you could walk southbound until you reach Pescara. In the North it ends where the big Hotel complexes are built along the beach. There's a pedestrian section, right along the beach. A lane especially for bikes. And of course the road for the cars. It's a nice thing to do in daytime. Enjoying the sun, visiting a restaurant, get some gelato along the walk or jump in the water in one of the many public sections. It can get quite hot for a walk in summer though.

The Promenade is even more fun in the evenings. In summer sections of the street will be completely closed for traffic on several days a week. Then the streets really belong to the pedestrians. It seems like the whole town gathers here then. Everybody has fun and is in good spirits. Fast food, gelato stalls, drink stalls. A good number of market stalls. Street performers, bands. They are all here. This Promenade comes really to life in the nighttime. At the northern end there is another market on weekends. One night there was even a small Oldtimer car-meeting happening on the closed street.

We enjoyed the walks here. Spend hours every evening. Never got boring, it's a fun thing to do. And in this town there are so few international tourists. Mostly locals and national visitors only. Makes the place feel so authentic. Loved it.",August 2020,Lungomare di Montesilvano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g194834-d3545429-Reviews-Lungomare_di_Montesilvano-Montesilvano_Province_of_Pescara_Abruzzo.html,"Montesilvano, Italy",attractions,5.0,3.5
Friendly folks - good food,"We enjoyed our stay in this fun, underrated Italian town. It was always fun strolling along the beach. Be it daytime or in the evening.
This restaurant / beach club here has a great location. It's right on the beach at the busy Promenade (Via Aldo Moro). Besides being a bar/restaurant they also run this section of the beach, renting out chairs and parasols.

But we came for the food. Jumped in the water between meals and drinks, as one of us always stayed in the restaurant, since we had our Bulldog with. Not allowed on the beach, but was very welcome here in the restaurant.

We came three times for lunch. Staff and owner always friendly. Prices very fair. The menu is short and some items might not be available at times when they sold out. But there was always something good to eat.

We had the fried seafood, fried calamari, steamed mussels, Pasta w/ Tuna sauce, fries, seafood Spaghetti and Seafood Risotto. It's good, down-to-earth home-style cooking. Good value and much better than you might expect from a beach restaurant.

Seafood and fish was always good, always fresh. The Tuna Pasta didn't look special, but tasted actually very very good. Seafood Spaghetti were good, a bit small in size though. A bit bland was the Seafood Risotto. The only thing I wouldn't order again. Besides that we really enjoyed our lunches here. Sometimes with White wine, sometimes with Rosé. Whole bottle, half-litre, quarter-litre. Up to you. Or a nice cold beer. They also got a good selection of liquors. Good after a meal. The Amarena Cherry Liquor was a real treat.

All in all a very good choice here to wine and dine on the bach. Would come back.",August 2020,Lido Onda Verde,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g194834-d8375972-Reviews-Lido_Onda_Verde-Montesilvano_Province_of_Pescara_Abruzzo.html,"Montesilvano, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.0
Quick and easy,"Didn't feel like going out for dinner and decided to take out some food from here. Was just a few minutes by foot away from our place. Passed this Take Away before and thought it looked good.

Most people come here for the skewers (Arrosticini). They come in ""Classico"" (beef), ""Fegato"" (liver) and ""Pollo"" (Chicken). Just cost about a buck each. Besides that there are a good number of Bruschetti on the menu, bistecca and sausages. Some daily specials (Pasta, Antipasti) as well.

We ordered a bunch of Arrosticini. All three kinds. They will be freshly grilled by order. Staff is friendly, service is fast, prices are low. You could also eat in if you like or on one of the tables outside.

Beef and Chicken were good choices. Some bits of the beef a bit chewy though. Liver was ok, not more.

Still, it's great value and surely a good place to pick up some skewers. But: there is another restaurant nearby that does them even better (better beef and better liver quality). So there's that. A good place, but we went back to the great one.",August 2020,La Pecora Pazza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g194834-d4788233-Reviews-La_Pecora_Pazza-Montesilvano_Province_of_Pescara_Abruzzo.html,"Montesilvano, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great Arrosticini,"Montesilvano is famous for its skewers (Arrosticini). This place had good feedback, so we gave it a try. First time we took a table outside. Nothing fancy, it's on a main street, run by a friendly family. But it's a place you will feel welcome and at home.

Ordered some Arrosticini (beef and ""fegato""....liver). A bunch of cold beers and some roasted chicken.

They seem to have a really good grill here. Both the skewers and the chicken were nicely grilled, good roasty flavours. Beef and liver quality was high, nice and tender. And just about a buck each. Great value.

Came back another day. This time for take-out. More of the Arrosticini. Really just takes a few minutes. Was still the same great quality. A really good option for a quick and easy meal. They do have a lot of other items on the menu. Looked really good, but we didn't have time to come back another time. Maybe next time.",August 2020,Trattoria Il Moccolo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g194834-d4749339-Reviews-Trattoria_Il_Moccolo-Montesilvano_Province_of_Pescara_Abruzzo.html,"Montesilvano, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good Pizza,"This is a great little place to take out some food. There are a very few standing tables, but most people take-out. During dinnertime it can get quite busy. So prepare to wait or call in your order a few hours before and pick it up later.

They have a good number of pizze. Classic (Rosse) and White (no tomato - Bianche). Also Foccace and Calzoni. Then lots of fried stuff: Arancini, Mozzarella, Fries, Crochette etc. And drinks (beer, water, soda).

Prices of the pizze start as low as 3.50. Most cost tops 6 Euros. Only the seafood pizza costs more: 8 Euros.
I ordered the ""Vocione"". A pizza topped with ham, mushrooms and salsicca (an italian sausage). Since it was busy it took a while. But it was well worth the wait. The Pizza dough is freshly made by hand and all pizze made right then before your eyes.

Quality of the toppings were high. Good meat and mushrooms. Good sized pizza as well, especially given the price.

A really great litte place to grab a quick lunch or dinner.",August 2020,Pizzeria Forno A Legna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g194834-d23041545-Reviews-Pizzeria_Forno_A_Legna-Montesilvano_Province_of_Pescara_Abruzzo.html,"Montesilvano, Italy",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Our worst evening in Italy 2020 - or in Italy EVER,"Based on some good reviews and the fact that it was in walking distance after a long days drive we came for dinner here. Took a table outside. Our Bulldog was welcome as well.

And it went downhill from then. There's no menu. No menu card. No wine card. Price? Who knows? We thought it might be a matter of language (our Italian is weak to nonexistent). So the next table helped us out (Italian, but talked English very well). So we got confirmed that there's no menu. Depending on the catch (and what whatever the cook has in mind) the menu is different.
Since we didn't feel like moving the restaurant we thought: let's try. Actually we came for a very nice cooked seafood platter we've saw online on the pics. But whatever.

Then the first two plates arrived. Quite big plates. One with anchovies in oil. One with seafood salad. Both cold dishes of course. One thing: Yes, the quality was good. Fish and seafood fresh, nicely prepared. The cook does his job very well. But we didn't come for starters actually. A bottle of white Wine was served with. Ok, but not great. Price? Unkown.
Then the third course arrived soon after. A big plate of cooked shrimp. But served cold. Like another seafood antipasti platter again. The third one. We then asked the service if there will be some warm dishes and when. The next table helping us out again. More starters were promised. Who knows how many. We asked to skip to the warm dishes, which we were told is not the way it's done.
But we were done. We told the staff to stop serving more dishes. Firstly, we had three big plates of (cold) food, which was plenty. Then we didn't like to be suprised with who knows how many more starters. And the following bill.
At least that worked, mood wasn't great for the rest of the evening. We finished the food and the wine and hoped for the best - and feared the worst. Bill came out at just around 60 Euros. Ok, could be worse. But it's still money for food we didn't really want.

Funniest thing is that - during our last half our at the restaurant - two other tables got served only a warm main meal. And a glass of wine. No endless starters, they've chosen what they wanted and got it. Ok, blame the language partly on that. But not fully, since we really got help from the other table.
Turns out this happened to other guests as well. I read some more reviews after. Quite a good number complained about the same scheme. And not just tourists like us. Happened to locals/Italians as well. Seems random what happenes here. Or maybe only regular guests get what they wish. I don't know. But there are the stories of others that got served up to 7 courses. All cold dishes. No mains. So it's not just us. And they paid big for it. We got away cheaper since we've stopped after three courses.

Definitely the worst dinner on our Road Trip in Italy 2020, or even ever in Italy. Not quality-wise, but as a whole experience.",August 2020,Lo Scalo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g194834-d3635468-Reviews-Lo_Scalo-Montesilvano_Province_of_Pescara_Abruzzo.html,"Montesilvano, Italy",restaurants,1.0,4.0
