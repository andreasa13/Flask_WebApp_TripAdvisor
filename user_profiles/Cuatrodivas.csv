American Airlines was great trying to help us!,"My family and I were traveling to Milan, Italy via London through Chicago. The morning of our flights, British Airways cancelled the flight and did not rebooked us. AA tried very hard to get us to Milan in different ways. They tried in the phone and they advised us to go to the airport. They tried in Tucson, but they told us to check in Chicago. Once in Chicago they got us booked in a different flight to Milan from London. They could not put us together, but we made it. Thank you American for helping us out when British Airways abandoned us!",November 2019,American Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729020-Reviews-American-Airlines,World,flights,5.0,3.0
They cancelled my flight on the day of departure!,"On the day of my departure, they cancelled my flight from London to Milan and they did not rebook us. I had to call BA on the phone, waited almost 1 1/2hr for a person from India that did not speak English well, to try to help me. It seems their computer system was not working on that day, because they told me to go to the airport. At the airport neither American Airlines which was connecting to British Airways was able to rebook us. Only once i got to Chicago, they were able to rebook us, but by then the 3 of us traveling together, had to sit in separate seats, not even together. We all had paid for special seats with leg room and to be together and nothing. They did not even return the money we paid for the seats.

"Tourist Israel is a BROKER, then they give you to Fun-Times company and you pay a fortune!","So far i feel that i have been duped. There were a lot of things, our tour cost $948 for 3 of us, then each one also had to pay $150 at the border with Jordan. That makes it 466 US dls. per person. We had to get up really early to meet the group in front of a hotel. That is when we noticed that it was not Tourist Israel picking us up, but rather a different group called Fun Times. The drivers were very nice. We were first picked up in a small van and 1 hr later, we were transferred to a large more comfortable bus with WIFI. Our driver was very nice and our tour guide was Jordanian so he knew a lot of history about his country. That was ok until the pit stop we did in a ""store"" to have tea and use the bathrooms. We were given water and tea but ""conveniently"" this place was a huge store with everything overpriced. Our guide said to buy anything to do it here because in Petra we would not have the time. I did, but In Petra they were way cheaper. REMIND yourself, especially if you are coming from the USA that although they are saying to you $100 dinar, it is really 200 dollars. It cost double for Americans because of the exchange rate. So better, buy them at Petra themselves, the people were nicer, they were not pushing you to buy at their store. You could not walk without being followed by them.. One replica knife and a coat ended up costing $400 US dollars. I was very disappointed that our guide would do that.

The only regret I have, is that nowhere in the literature do they say bring your bathing suit. It makes it feel that you are just stopping to see it and we are going. But in fact the stop there is close to 1 hr so you can actually go down the steps and bathe in the Dead Sea. I did not bring my bathing suit, and my husband rented one so that he could.

It was lovely to not fight with others or have to be in line to be able to touch it and pray.",March 2019,Christ's Tomb,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293983-d324448-Reviews-Christ_s_Tomb-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",attractions,5.0,4.5
"A must do, the last 4 stations are here!","I was touched, it was an incredible experience to be able to touch the sacred stones that cover Jesus Tomb. I was able to feel close to God and pray for my family and friends. It is better to visit it early in the morning. They open at 5am, and you will have the chance to have the Church to yourself. Otherwise, it will be packed with tourists and you will not be able to get to touch nor visit the stones that cover Jesus tomb since the lines are so long. Instead, go there early. I was there at 5am and we had the church for ourselves. It was a relieve to have the place to ourselves, it was calmed, we felt close to God here, without anyone but a mass that was taking place early in the morning. It was a great visit.",March 2019,Église du Saint-Sépulcre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293983-d318942-Reviews-Eglise_du_Saint_Sepulcre-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Magnificent, It was a highlight for us!","The three of us went with a tour group and they took us to the Western Wall as part of our tour of Old Jerusalem. It was a really beautiful sunny day. My husband and my brother both wore their Karmulkah and I got my veil. They explained to us that once you pray and you touch the wall and perhaps leave your messages to God, when is time to leave, you do not give your back to the Wall, you slowly back-out.
What bothered me perhaps is that the men side was much larger than the females, and then there were 2 rows of females sitting down in their chairs and they were not letting anyone pass by them. I did not come all the way from Tucson, Arizona, to not touch the wall or leave my message to God. So as soon as one of the ladies stood up, i took her chair out, and moved the one in front, and i was able to actually get close to the wall and pray. Other females behind me follow me and did the same thing. I was touched and felt elated to be able to have this personal experience, alas alone, since my husband was on the other side, but I did. I was able to pray for all my family and friends and have a moment with God.",March 2019,Western Wall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293983-d318216-Reviews-Western_Wall-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing visit to Old City!,"We were able to visit not only with a tour, but also by ourselves. We wanted to do all the stations of the Via Dolorosa, but we were unable to do it during the day, too many tourists. So we woke up one day at 4am and we got to Lion's Gate at 5:00am to start our own tour, the three of us of the Via Dolorosa. We felt so close to God and it was just marvelous to have all these old streets for ourselves. Surprised the the Church of the Holy Sepulchre would open so early too, so we were able to see everything and touch all the holy places that early in the morning.",March 2019,Old City of Jerusalem,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293983-d318937-Reviews-Old_City_of_Jerusalem-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",attractions,5.0,5.0
Amazing apartment although in noisy street!,"Getting to the apartment was not bad at all, finding the door on the side of the building and then getting the code was not difficult. Afterwards we found our keys to our apartment and we found it nice and clean, perfect for three adults. We had washer, dryer and anything we might need to cook and clean ourselves. Behind the apartment there is a small supermarket so we were able to walk 20 steps and get food to cook in our kitchen. We had coffee, tea that they left for us on the table. The young lady was amazing and so friendly.

We went on our own and this was fantastic to see. Very well preserved!,"Loved seeing the ruins that are so well preserved for all of us to see. I was impressed with the streets, the houses and the one thing i will always remember is the room with the big colorful amphoras.

"very nice, clean and very polite crew","Fabulous, on time, polite crew, great snacks. The only draw back was not in Athens to Tel Aviv flight, but actually in Athens to Santorini.

They did not let me board my plane to Paris,"Delta-KLM-AF are all now one company. When I flew from Tucson to Los Angeles, Delta never said one thing to me about my passport having 5 months and 25 days left. While boarding in LAX my name was called and it was then that the AF agent told me i could not board the plane. He was counting with his fingers the days and told me that I needed 6 months in my passport, that Egypt nor Turkey would give me visas. When i provided my visas for them to see, they still did not let me board saying that France would not let me enter either. Because according them I was a NO SHOW, AF invalidated my original ticket and made me purchase a new set of tickets for 4 days later when i could get an emergency passport. This was the worst treatment. The least they could have done was to use my original tickets and let me re-use them 4 days later. Nope, i had to buy new tickets for 2 people. My husband could not fly because he has confusion caused by medications for Parkinsons, so we had to arrive to our 2nd country Israel, rather than Egypt. We lost all that portion of our trip.",March 2019,Air France,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729003-Reviews-Air-France,World,flights,3.0,3.5
