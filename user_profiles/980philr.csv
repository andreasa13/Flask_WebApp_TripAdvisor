Good visit,"My wife and I had an order to go. We were able to call in the order in advance and it was ready when we got there. They got the order correct and reviewed the order with me before I left. Even though it was a very busy Friday night, they still tried to keep everyone six feet apart. All of the staff was using masks and they used a sanitizing wipe on my card as well as the pen as they handed them to me. Plus the food was good.

Great dinner.,"My wife and I enjoyed our dinner here. They used high quality steaks for our carne asada and the food was delicious.

I especially enjoyed the live singer that was there Friday night. He sang more popular music than some other live places and sounded very good.

Nice wine tasting,"My wife and I loved this place. They have a larger variety of wines and hard ciders than I expected from sweet all the way to dry wines. They also have some unique flavors as well. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the wines and treated us fantastically. Very reasonably priced as well. We sampled five wines for $6.00. Prices on the bottles range from $10 to $29ish.

My wife and I got two bottles of unique wines to take home.

I recommend Stone Pillar and we will definitely be back.",March 2020,Stone Pillar Vineyard & Winery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g38954-d10065516-Reviews-Stone_Pillar_Vineyard_Winery-Olathe_Kansas.html,"Olathe, Kansas",attractions,5.0,4.5

Great Dive Boat,"This is a great boat! They are very safety conscious. They have a dive master in the water on every dive you can follow if you choose. They encourage safety stops and never rushed anyone on their safety stops. Had a minimum of 1 hour between every dive. They also keep a log of all divers in the water as well as their depth and time.

Great customer service. They put your fins on for you on the dive platform. They filled your tank from your dive station. They gave great photo tips if you asked for it. They would even wake you up in the morning and bring your favorite drink to your room if you wanted. They don't have a set itinerary, so they are always looking for the best diving conditions for the divers.The airlines lost one of my bags, and they even coordinated with the airline to get me my bag 2 hours out to sea. This crew really loved what they do and enjoy seeing others have fun.

It's an easy boat to dive off of. One of the largest camera tables I've ever seen on a liveaboard. They help you into your fins at the dive platform. The dive platform is very large and stable. 2 large ladders to get back on the boat and crew there to take off you fins for you while you are still in the water. There was one diver well into his 70s on our boat, and he was able get around easily.

The food was delicious and plentiful. I gained weight this week while doing 4 to 5 dives a day. Snacks between dives. They also accommodate different dietary restrictions.

I have dove with the Aggressor multiple times in Belize and I have never been disappointed. I will definitely be back.",January 2020,Aggressor Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g291968-d19922578-Reviews-Aggressor_Adventures-Belize_City_Belize_District.html,"Belize City, Belize",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good coral and many fish,"I dove Lighthouse the 2nd week of January.

We had some weather all week so our viz. was
only about 30 to 40 feet for the week. Water temperature was 81°F, I dove with a 2mm shorty and was a little cool.

All the same, I enjoyed my diving. The reef is in good shape, the fish are plentiful, very friendly and easier to photograph than in many other areas. The nice thing about Lighthouse Reef is that it is a large enough area that if one area is not optimal diving, there are plenty of other sites. The diving is also very easy, even beginners can safely dive here.

I will definitely be back, this is some of my favorite diving in the Caribbean.",January 2020,Lighthouse Reef,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14035153-d313635-Reviews-Lighthouse_Reef-Lighthouse_Reef_Atoll_Belize_Cayes.html,"Lighthouse Reef Atoll, Belize",attractions,4.0,5.0
"An absolute must do dive, once","This is a very unique dive. Starts at 90 to 95 feet and max depth is recreational limit. At 90 feet the sheer wall cuts back about 25 to 30 feet and you swim around huge stalagmites and stalagmites. I have never dove anything like it anywhere else.

You will probably have a thermocline and it's easy to get a little narced. The wall starts at about 25 feet and from there is a gradual slope to the surface, so the safety stop is easy.

I recommend the dive for anyone who has some experience with deep dives and dives with a computer",January 2020,Great Blue Hole,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14035153-d296241-Reviews-Great_Blue_Hole-Lighthouse_Reef_Atoll_Belize_Cayes.html,"Lighthouse Reef Atoll, Belize",attractions,4.0,4.5
Got the job done,"First of all, this is a $50 a night hotel United put me in. But for the price it was a place to sleep.

The pluses: free airport shuttle, cheap, clean and comfortable bed, the restaurants accept airline vouchers.

The minuses: breakfast not included with price, no toothpaste or toothbrush available, no hand soap in room, breakfast was only ok.

Overall, I'm not upset that the airline put me here, but unless I need a very inexpensive option I probably wouldn't choose it again.",January 2020,Red Lion Hotel Houston Intercontinental Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g56003-d1514581-Reviews-Red_Lion_Hotel_Houston_Intercontinental_Airport-Houston_Texas.html,"Houston, Texas",hotels,3.0,4.0
Nice Mexican restaurant,"My wife and I were there at 6:00 on a Friday night and were seated and served right away. The waiter was pleasant and very attentive.

Private shuttle from the airport,"Nice shuttle service. They had a station set up just outside the exit. Since we had pre-booked, they had our name on a list of passengers and with minimal wait we were taken to our minivan. The vehicle was very comfortable and clean. Our driver was super friendly and pointed out some of the activities around on our way to the hotel.

Just make sure that you look for them outside of the terminal about 25 yards to the left as you exit.

I would use them again.",July 2019,SuperShuttle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150807-d13976830-Reviews-SuperShuttle-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",attractions,4.0,3.0
Great resort,"My wife and I had a great time at the Royal Sands. The property was beautiful and clean. The property was big, but not so big that you had to walk 30 minutes to get anything. The food was FANTASTIC. Best food I've had at any of the resorts in Mexico. Everyone was super friendly and helpful.

Some have written about seaweed on the beach. Yes there was a little bit, but it was definitely not even close to being a nuisance. They resorts clean the beaches every morning and we thought that the beaches were wonderful.

What I thought was a great touch was that after check-out on your last day, they let you stay and enjoy the resort until 4:00 still on your all-inclusive perks. The porters watch and secure your bags in the meanwhile.

Some tips and notes. 1) Plan time to just hang out at the pool, especially the swim-up bar. (Luis was great) 2) Don't forget your room key. You have to leave a $300 deposit at check-in that covers any tips you want to leave or items you want to buy at the shops. The room key links that to your account. 3) Bring suntan lotion 4) Leave some tips for the service. The workers don't make much so little tips help them a lot.

Also a big thanks not just to Luis but also to Mario our waiter. He was funny and very attentive to what we needed.

The only thing that I wish we could have done was upgrade our room, so maybe the resort could make sure to offer that option on check-in.

We had a beautiful experience and look forward to going back.",August 2019,The Royal Sands All Suites Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d153138-Reviews-The_Royal_Sands_All_Suites_Resort_Spa-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
La Destileria Tequila Shop,"We didn't eat at the restaurant but did the tequila sampling at the liquor shop. It was very educational. They know about how long different tequilas are ages and in what type of casks. The samples were free and was enough to get a good taste of the alcohol. We bought a top line extra añejo tequila for $100 which is not far off from a good sipping tequila in the US.

We enjoyed the tequila shop and would go back.",July 2019,La Destileria Cancun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150807-d1014127-Reviews-La_Destileria_Cancun-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great manicure and pedicure,"My wife got a manicure and pedicure while I
went to the gym there.

The manicurist that my wife had (Kevin) really took his time and made sure that my wife had exactly what she wanted and that she enjoyed the experience and felt pampered.

My experience at the gym was great. The equipment was all in top shape. They had several types of cardio machines ( ellipticals, 2 types of treadmills, rowing machines and steppers). They have some free weights. Water and work-out towels are provided.

Overall, we were both very happy and would go back again.",July 2019,Spa at The Royal Sands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150807-d292953-Reviews-Spa_at_The_Royal_Sands-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",attractions,5.0,5.0
It was just OK,"We had Captain's Cove as part of our all-inclusive package at the Royal Sands Resort. What was included was a buffet dinner, drinks, and a Caribbean show.

First, what we didn't like. 1) While the food was edible, it really wasn't great. There are better restaurants at the Royal Sands all-inclusive package. 2) The drinks really weren't that good. After our first drink ( wife had a margarita and I had a Piña colada) we stuck to water and soda. 3) No air conditioning. It got a bit hot.

Now the good. 1) it had a nice view of the lagoon. 2) The service was friendly. 3) They had TV's showing Latin music videos 4) The Caribbean Show (while nowhere near Vegas quality) was not bad. The dancers did put energy into their routines and at times the dance moves were quite impressive.

So, while we don't regret going, we probably try something else next time.",July 2019,Captain's Cove,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150807-d1014595-Reviews-Captain_s_Cove-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Upscale American style mall,"The mall was very attractive. There were many unoccupied spaces. The majority of the store were upscale shops common in malls un the US.

Nice walk.,"I mainly was south of the Isla Shopping Area. The sidewalks were in decent shape. There were a few restaurants and shops along the Avenida between the Malls and the resorts. Overall, not a lot to do or see, but a safe way to walk between destinations.

A caution, there are not many crosswalks, so you may need to plan well in advance before you cross the street.",July 2019,Avenida Kukulkan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150807-d2536680-Reviews-Avenida_Kukulkan-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",attractions,3.0,4.5
Great shopping mall,"This shopping area has something for everyone. Places that sold Mexican souvenirs, places to buy and sample alcohol, high end shops, low end shops, high end restaurants to McDonald's. Had a dolphin experience and an aquarium (I didn't have time to see). I saw nothing there that wouldn't be considered family friendly. It seemed very safe and secure (I saw various police in the area, but they weren't intrusive). Everyone in the shops were very friendly and helpful. The area was spotless, including the restrooms. Easy walking distance from most hotels.

The only caution is that there are a lot of people trying to get you to go to timeshare presentations. The longer you listen, the more they talk. If you don't want to sit through a timeshare presentation, just say ""no thanks"" and keep walking.

Wonderful evening,"My wife and I loved the food. We had fish, and it was wonderful. The service was great and attentive (thanks going out to Alvaro and Miguel). The restaurant was very clean. The live music was excellent, really made for a great night. We would definitely go back.

The live music is Tuesday and Thursday nights starting at 7 pm. They take reservations. If you are with one of the Royal Resorts all inclusive options, they have clearly marked which menu items are included and which ones have an extra charge. (Even the extra charges for some items were pretty small).",July 2019,Hacienda Sisal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150807-d1050119-Reviews-Hacienda_Sisal-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great shopping area,"My family loved this shopping area. My wife said that this was one of favorite shopping areas ever. I even enjoyed it. Nice variety of shops and everyone was beyond friendly and helpful. The prices were extremely reasonable. They had some very nice restaurants and snack shops with great ice cream. It is more of a bazaar feel in some of the smaller streets. This area is very close to a museum, several ancient agoras, and the temple of Hephaestus. There is also a great view of the Acropolis. Obviously, it is a crowded shopping area for tourists, so you have to use some common sense. That being said, we never felt any type of security risk and felt more secure here than in many American shopping malls. We will definitely go back here on our next trip to Greece.",September 2018,Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d265865-Reviews-Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
"Great crew, good boat","I had fun this week. This review is only about the MV Dolphin and not about Tubbataha.
The pluses: the rooms were not cramped, the. AC in the bedrooms worked very well, large dining room and upper deck, the crew was FANTASTIC (very attentive to needs, got the equipment to and from the dive dinghies, organized, super friendly), the food was delicious, the crew did their best to maximize the number of dives we got, dive safety was emphasized but not to the point of treating us like children. They had a dedicated rinse tank for cameras. Karaoke night was a lot of fun as well.

The negatives : the camera table is very small, the mat on the gear up area was really tough on the feet, the water drained a bit slow in the shower, and the gear up area was cramped. We got around the rough mat by just wearing our sandals. There were really only two of us with sizable cameras so we could make it fit. The cramped gear up area was managed by the crew organizing the groups and the time we were there to gear up. The only thing that I had to deal with was a slow shower drain, and I figured that I have to deal with that at my house sometimes as well. Honestly, I've been on many boats with much worse problems.

Overall, I felt that I got more than my money's worth on the MV Dolphin. If I dive Tubbataha again, I would use the MV Dolphin again.",April 2019,MV Dolphin Liveaboard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294255-d17380743-Reviews-MV_Dolphin_Liveaboard-Palawan_Island_Palawan_Province_Mimaropa.html,"Palawan Island, Philippines",attractions,4.0,2.0
Great Coral,"This was my experience diving the first week of April in 2019.

Water temperature at depth: 79°F; above 50 feet temps were 82-83°F; air temp was low 90s F. I was very comfortable in a 2 mm shorty, everyone else was in a 3 mm full or more.

Visibility anywhere from 30 to 60 feet.

Currents ranged from very slight to strong with one dive nearly ripping. Encountered moderately strong down current once.

I'll rate different aspects of the dives from 1 to 10, 1 being horrible and 10 being the best I've ever seen.

Big stuff: 4. A lot of gray reef sharks, my group saw a hammerhead, the other group saw a tiger shark, and we saw some marbled rays. No whale sharks, no mantas, no dolphins,

Schooling fish: 9. Huge schools of jacks, some schools of barracudas. The abundance was impressive.

Reef fish: 10. Angelfish, butterfly fish, foxface, damsels, anthias, blennies, clowns, plus more. In abundance and in every color imaginable. Like a rainbow swimming over a reef.

Coral: 10. Undeniably the best I've ever seen. Corals were plentiful, different types, and healthy. I didn't notice any bleaching.

Macro: 5. In all fairness, the currents half of the time were too strong to slow down and look for the small stuff. But we did find a ghost pipefish and numerous sea slugs and nudibranchs.

We did stop at a ranger station, where they had a few shirts and stickers. Bring pesos in smaller denominations.

Be aware that the boats can only use the mooring lines, and the number of moorings are limited. So if no mooring lines are available, you may spend several days in one area.

I dove on the M/V Dolphin. I would give them 9 out of 10 rating. The pluses: my room was spacious, a/c worked very well in the cabin,very good food, super friendly and helpful staff, very super organized dive deck (which was necessary because it was small), live entertainment night, staff move your equipment to and from the mother ship and dive boats, while I didn't use the rental gear I did see it and it looked new and in excellent condition, super safety conscious ( long, slow accents, safety stops never broken, dive masters reminding divers that we've done multiple deep dives over multiple days), and they maximized the amount of dives we got in.

The only negatives were a small camera table, the non-slip mat on the dive deck was rough on the feet (make sure you wear sandals) , a small gear up area, and the nitrox fills were a bit slow.

Bottom line, would I go back? Yes, maybe someday after I knock a few other destinations off my bucket list. Would I use the M/V Dolphin again? Yes",April 2019,Tubbataha Reef,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294257-d667333-Reviews-Tubbataha_Reef-Puerto_Princesa_Palawan_Island_Palawan_Province_Mimaropa.html,"Palawan Island, Philippines",attractions,4.0,5.0
Very nice street vendors,"I didn't see much of the Shrine, I spent nearly all of my time at the market next to the Shrine. They had nice souvenirs at good prices. This is one of a few really nice places

A few tips: 1) Bring cash in pesos. No one takes credit cards. 2) Be prepared to say no. Some can be a little pushy, but not obnoxiously so. Just say no thanks and move on. 3) Parking is across the street and costs a few pesos, so bring some change. 4) Check through the shops then go back to buy what you want. Some shops have similar items in different styles. So if you check everything out first, you make sure that you get exactly what you want.

If I get back to Cebu, this is one of two shopping areas I will definitely visit again.",April 2019,Magellan Shrine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298461-d1451698-Reviews-Magellan_Shrine-Lapu_Lapu_Mactan_Island_Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,"Mactan Island, Philippines",attractions,4.0,3.5

Pros: 1) 15 minutes from the airport, and they provide free airport shuttle 2) breakfast was included 3) within a couple minutes walk to restaurants, groceries, and some stores 4) super friendly and helpful staff. 5) they can help book tours

Cons: 1) rooms were small. 2) didn't have hot water in the shower 2 days 3) the pool was small and shallow

"As a museum and historical site, horrendous","First off, this is a Catholic church in use, and during my visit they were using the worship area. My comments are about it as a historical building and a museum. And as a historical building and a museum, this is undeniably the worst I have seen on any of the 5 continents I have visited, by far. The building was originally made from coral blocks mortared together with egg shells. They have replaced damaged parts with concrete blocks and modern mortar, with absolutely no consideration for the original building materials or building methods. Even worse, in areas, they have plastered or painted over the original stones. This would never, ever be allowed in Egypt, Greece, Rome, Cambodia, Central and South America or in the US. That's just before you walk in the door. The inside repairs looked like they were pieced together with whatever the workers had on hand. They used modern nails all over the place. Different types and colors of wood were patched into damaged areas. On one door they actually nailed a piece of modern flooring to it to replace a missing support piece.Latches were replaced with more modern closures. Where the hardware was original, the used modern nuts and bolts to hold it together. Areas were recently plastered and painted either to cover or replace the original walls. Where the original shell pieces that formed the window panels broke, they were replaced with shells that were nowhere close to the original color (that mistake was just zero attention to what is actually bigger than details).

Enough on the actual building, now for the museum. There were minimal signs to explain the pieces or their significance to the history of the area, or even their common usage for those not familiar with Catholicism. The ""restored "" documents were not restored using original ink or similar writing styluses, giving the documents the appearance that someone just used a modern pen to darken the original letters. The tapestries, cloths, and papers were put in regular glass cabinets under normal household light bulbs. Historical items of this nature should be displayed in sealed, climate controlled cases with special UV lights to remove moisture from the displayed items and to protect them from discoloration.

1 star for this ""historical building and museum"" is actually 2 stars too many. Absolutely atrocious restoration and museum efforts.

Bottom line, definitely skip it. Your time is better spent doing pretty much anything else.",April 2019,Baclayon Church,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294259-d548153-Reviews-Baclayon_Church-Bohol_Island_Bohol_Province_Visayas.html,"Bohol Island, Philippines",attractions,1.0,4.0
Unique and Beautiful Scenery,"To say average doesn't mean that it's bad. There are close to 1000 of these hills in this area and the observation deck gives you a good view of them. It is a pretty scene. I just wouldn't make a special day long trip to get here when there is so much more to do in the Philippines. However, as part of a day tour package that includes other stops, it is a very nice place to include.

Some tips: There's several hundred steps to get to the top observation deck, so bring comfortable shoes and be ready to climb. There is no provisions for people with disabilities or the elderly, so if you have mobility problems you probably won't want to try. However, behind the restaurant on the main drop off area is another observation area for another area of the Chocolate Hills. People with health or mobility issues may want to go for that observation area. There are several rest areas on the way to the top. Bring water, there is none available at the observation deck. If you didn't bring any, they sell some at the souvenir shops next to the restaurant.

Bottom line, I wouldn't make a special trip only for the Chocolate Hills, but I did enjoy it a lot and would recommend itas part of a day trip package.",April 2019,Chocolate Hills Natural Monument,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294259-d593829-Reviews-Chocolate_Hills_Natural_Monument-Bohol_Island_Bohol_Province_Visayas.html,"Bohol Island, Philippines",attractions,3.0,4.0
Great river cruise,"This was better than I expected. The food was very decent to good. The scenery was gorgeous. The female singer on boat #2 was incredibly talented.

Nice stop for a couple of minutes.,"This is a man made forest on the way to the Chocolate Hills. The scenery is beautiful and the trees are large, I just wouldn't make a special trip for it. But as a stop on the way to other areas, it is a nice peaceful break.

Tips: DON'T PLAY IN THE HIGHWAY. Sad that some haven't figured that cars driving down a curvy highway may not be able to avoid you ( or even see you) if you decide to lay down in the middle of the highway just to get a picture, but I saw it numerous times. People, getting hit by a car can hurt. Just don't do it. That being said, the road is winding, so if you are prone to get car sick, take something before you go. Also, when you stop, a wide angle lens will help get you some great shots.",April 2019,Mahogany Forest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1082590-d1124042-Reviews-Mahogany_Forest-Loboc_Bohol_Island_Bohol_Province_Visayas.html,"Bohol Island, Philippines",attractions,3.0,4.0
"Beautiful scenery, good food, great singer","This was much better than I expected. The area was well organized. There are a lot of boats at the dock but the river never seemed crowded. The food was much better than I expected, it was actually good, not great, but good. The river was gorgeous. The ride was very smooth. The female singer we had was spectacular. They also stopped for a show some local children put on. I've read negative comments about it, but all of the children I saw were smiling and really seemed to enjoy themselves and their show. They also have modern rest rooms at the dock.

Some tips. Bring a camera you definitely want pictures, but don't forget to put the camera down and just enjoy the scenery. I suggest that you get on boat number 2. There were 2 singers on boat#2, but the woman was outstanding. The souvenir shops here are ok, but you will definitely find better ones at other places.

Bottom line, I would do this again.",April 2019,Loboc River Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1082590-d1073515-Reviews-Loboc_River_Cruise-Loboc_Bohol_Island_Bohol_Province_Visayas.html,"Bohol Island, Philippines",attractions,5.0,3.5
Very nice art,Nice place to shop for local souvenirs. Super friendly people. They gave me a good discount on what I bought. Packed everything very well for taking on an airplane. They also take credit cards.,April 2019,Artevalman Handicraft Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608518-d7812793-Reviews-Artevalman_Handicraft_Market-Mandaue_Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,"Cebu Island, Philippines",attractions,5.0,5.0
Adorable creatures,"The tarsiers are just flat out adorably cute. They had found 5 on the day I was there. I also like the facility. They try hard to keep people from molesting the tarsiers and they don't interfere with their behavior. They go out in the morning to find them, then put a small barricade around them for their protection and keep at least one staff member there to help the visitors and protect the tarsiers. If they find four, we get to see 4. If there is only 1, the visitors only see one. Plus all of the staff members are super friendly. One even took a picture of a tarsier with me in the background.

Just some tips and things to remember. Quiet is mandatory. It is for the safety of the tarsiers. Also don't molest the tarsiers or get too close. Take some bug repellent. Bring some cash for souvenirs, they are cheap and tarsier themed. Also, when you are on the road take some toilet paper, as not all rest rooms have it, not sure about here, but just a general rule.",April 2019,Philippine Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3649283-d320849-Reviews-Philippine_Tarsier_and_Wildlife_Sanctuary-Corella_Bohol_Province_Visayas.html,"Corella, Philippines",attractions,5.0,4.0
Great fun,"Huge zipline. You are ziplining over the ocean for a full minute and a half. The view is gorgeous. You have to take a small and at times steep path to get there, so this is not an activity for people with health problems or limited mobility.

A few tips. 1) Bring some cash. You can buy a very inexpensive photo of yourself ziplining. 2) Bring toilet paper. None of the bathrooms have it. 3) Make sure that anything that you take with you can be secured. If you drop it off the zipline, don't plan on getting it back without scuba gear.

Cool experience,"This was more fun than I expected. We climbed through the inside of a huge rock to a great view at the top.

This is not an activity for someone in poor health or has mobility issues. We had to climb up rocks, squeeze thru tight openings, and climbed a 80 degree grade with the help of someone pulling us up with a rope. You can either zipline down from the top or go back down through the rock. I had already done another zipline, so I went back through the rock and enjoyed it.

You have to enjoy physical activities and adventure to enjoy this activity.

A few tips. 1) Bring good shoes. You cannot do this in flip-flops. 2) Stretch beforehand. 3) Listen to your guide. She gave us good pointers to get us around, over and through different areas 4) Bring toilet paper. None of the public toilets provide toilet paper. 5) Bring a bottle of water

This was a great addition to the Underground River trip. I recommend Ugong Rock",April 2019,Ugong Rock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294257-d2104146-Reviews-Ugong_Rock-Puerto_Princesa_Palawan_Island_Palawan_Province_Mimaropa.html,"Palawan Island, Philippines",attractions,5.0,4.5
Truly Beautiful,"To be honest, I kind of expected a tourist trap when I booked this, but I was thoroughly impressed. I've been through underwater rivers in other parts of the world and this one is truly spectacular. You take a 10 minute boat ride from a dock to the entrance area. The beach and forest around the Underground River is beautiful. The Underground River tour is roughly 45 minutes and you listen to a pre-recorded tour on a head set (although you may have to use a lot of imagination to see the images in the rock formations). This is a really beautiful area.

Some tips 1) You will be walking through some water, so wear appropriate footwear 2) the monkeys are cute, but they are also accomplished thieves. I saw one take off with a Gatorade bottle a woman dropped for only a second. 3) Go with a tour company. There is a mountain of paperwork involved with getting into the Underground River. You can't just walk up and get in. The Philippine government is serious about taking care of the area. Save yourself the hassle and let the tour company do it. 4) Take toilet paper with you. None of the bathrooms you can use have it, or if they do you have to pay for it. 5) Take a bottle of water 6) Keep your mouth shut inside the cave. Bats fly overhead and they can relieve themselves in flight.

I highly recommend this trip.",April 2019,Puerto Princesa Underground River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294257-d320343-Reviews-Puerto_Princesa_Underground_River-Puerto_Princesa_Palawan_Island_Palawan_Province_.html,"Palawan Island, Philippines",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Good, friendly bar","I had fun here. The buko rum is spectacular. They had several beers. The bartender (I think her name is Phem) was great. She knew the different beers and has a great personality. She was a blast.

As is the case with most small breweries I've visited, not all beers are available at all times. But Phem explained that right away and had good suggestions for what I might like.

Another great thing about this brewery is that it is a successful female ran business. I think one of the first female owned and operated in the Philippines.

I will definitely try to make it back again before I leave Puerto Princessa.",April 2019,Palaweno Brewery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294257-d7834864-Reviews-Palaweno_Brewery-Puerto_Princesa_Palawan_Island_Palawan_Province_Mimaropa.html,"Palawan Island, Philippines",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great hotel by the airport,"I was very impressed. They have a shuttle to and from the airport, but since it was only a 5 minute walk, I didn't use it. The suites are true suites, dining area with a sitting room and bathroom, and a separate bedroom and large bathroom. The pluses and minuses.
Pluses 1) 5 minute walk from the airport 2) Sound proof hotel. I never heard any airport noise 3) spacious and comfortable rooms 4) good breakfast 5) airport shuttle service on demand 6) very relaxing atmosphere. 7) friendly service 8) immaculately clean. 9) well equipped with soap, toothbrush and toothpaste and shaving supplies. 10) has a nice looking pool and gym.

The only negative was that some of the buffet food items weren't kept hot. But you can get fresh made omelets to skip this problem.

Be aware that they do check the room before you check out, so give yourself about 5 minutes for that. Since they don't require a cash or credit cards deposit when you check in, this seems reasonable to me, just give yourself an extra 5 minutes.

Bottom line, I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.",April 2019,Waterfront Airport Hotel and Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298461-d577834-Reviews-Waterfront_Airport_Hotel_and_Casino-Lapu_Lapu_Mactan_Island_Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,"Mactan Island, Philippines",hotels,5.0,4.0
Very good dinner,"The steak and seafood were fantastic. The side dishes were good and large enough to share. The service was very friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The waiter, Paul, even offered to go down the street to get us a special drink. If you want a certain type of seafood, you can let them know when you make your reservations and they will order it in.

Interesting,"Nice dormant volcano. There were a few volcanic vents along the way. I a couple of places you could dig a little to get to a hot layer of earth. Really good view of the Caldera and the west side of Santorini. Don't expect Volcano National Park of Hawaii size, but for Greece and Europe, it was a really good trip. Some pointers: wear good shoes (not sandals), it is a rocky hike. This is a bit of a trek uphill and not wheelchair accessible, so if you don't have good mobility or stamina, you might want to skip this one.",September 2018,Nea Kameni,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d481767-Reviews-Nea_Kameni-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Very good dive shop,"First of all, the only reason that I didn't give this shop 5 stars was because their boat wasn't working the day I dove with them. That has probably been fixed by now. If not for that problem, I would have given them 5 stars. I did 2 shore dives with them in the caldera and was at their shop in Perissa. THE SHOP IN PERISSA: well stocked shop, took credit cards, super easy and friendly. Arranged transportation to the caldera. Reliable pick up in a very decent van. The communication was superb. The shop really has its act together. THE SHOP AT THE CALDERA: cash only, well stocked with rental gear that was ready when I got there. The rental gear was newer and in good shape (nothing worn, inflator on bc didn't stick, mouth piece on regulator not cracked, fin straps and pockets not worn or cracked, 5 mil wetsuits in a lot of sizes) had storage cabinets for personal belongings and a bathroom, fresh water shower, beach chairs with umbrellas to relax on between dives, cookies and water available, and a sweet shop dog who is fluent in begging cookies. Also has a stamp for log book. Bring your own towel. THE DIVING: the boat wasn't working so I can't review that. Beach entry wasn't bad and the dive guides offered all the help they could, they were very safety conscious, they had two dive guides in the water on the first dive to make sure that the divers were ok, dive guide Will knew where everyone was during the dives, long, slow swimming safety stops and over an hour surface interval between dives.

Nice beach hotel.,"First off, you're not spending $2000 a night (not an exaggeration) like some of the hotels in Fira or Oia, so don't expect that level of hotel. That being said, this was a nice, economical hotel. Here's the pluses and minuses.

Pluses: 1) Maria. She worked the front desk and is one of the most pleasant people I've ever met. 2) the hotel is on the best beach I saw in Santorini. You have free use of the beach amenities) large rooms. My mother and father-in-law were traveling with their adult daughter and needed a room to accommodate three adults, and this room easily did that. 4) Easy access to everything in Perissa 5) Maria at the front desk can help set up tours. 6) price, there are hotels in Perissa that charge over $1000 per night, this hotel is not one of them. Very reasonably priced. 7) they have a mini refrigerator and kitchenette. 8) breakfast is included

Minuses 1) the rooms are quite old. 2)the beds are a bit hard 3) the a/c unit has a bit of a trick to get them to work.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.",September 2018,Joy Beach Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g657830-d5327280-Reviews-Joy_Beach_Hotel-Perivolos_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
It was only ok,"We were there in the afternoon, and we thought that it was ok, but not great.

The pluses: 1) It does have a great view of the Caldera. 2) The food they serve tastes good.

The negatives: 1) They only have 2 sweet wines. There are only two semi-sweet wines. And one of the sweet wines is actually a desert wine that you can get in other places. For a winery, this seems like an extremely limited selection. 2) the service wasn't great. The waiter was very slow getting to us, he was too busy cleaning off another table. It took a long time to get our food. 3) there was no explanation of the wines we were drinking. Other wineries explained the taste, processing and interesting facts about their wines. Here, they just gave us the wines and only told us their names.

The sweet wines were good ( I wouldn't say world class, but good). The winery was ok, but there are better in Santorini.

Everything perfect except for wine selections,"This is a great place to visit. The view of the sunset was perfect. The restaurant is clean. The service was friendly. The food was good. The descriptions of the wines were insightful.

I only gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons. 1) The food selection was very limited. 2) The wine selection was very limited. They only have two sweet wines and two semi-dry wines. I was hoping for a larger selection of sweet wines, especially from a winery.

Great shopping area.,"We all loved this shopping area. They had a lot of Greek leather shoes, belts, and bags. It has several art shops. Many good restaurants. A lot of t-shirt and souvenir stores. I suggest that you use one of the parking garages close by. The parking garages average a little more than 2 euros per hour, but finding parking on a street is nearly impossible.
