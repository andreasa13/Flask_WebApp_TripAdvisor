Great food & atmosphere,We were after a traditional Scottish pub and this didn't disappoint. A must visit if you are in the area. Loved the fact that the locals could take their dogs inside. This might sound odd to some but it added to the character.,May 2016,Moulin Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186566-d5902846-Reviews-Moulin_Inn-Pitlochry_Perth_and_Kinross_Scotland.html,"Pitlochry, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
Good location & value for money but.....,"If you like a comfortable bed don't sleep here. The bed was hard and lumpy and the walls are paper thin. Not at all what you want after flying from Australia. Despite this, the room was very clean & the staff on the front desk were all extremely helpful.",May 2016,"Point A Hotel, London Kings Cross St Pancras",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d3240599-Reviews-Point_A_Hotel_London_Kings_Cross_St_Pancras-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,2.0,4.0

Perfect stay!,"My husband & I were wanting a relaxing holiday at a beach side resort. We got what we wanted & more. The attention to detail & warm friendly staff were such a pleasure. The choice of pools, quality restaurants and bars made it a wonderful stay. The choice of outside restaurants only a few steps away were all great & we went to some more than once. We will be booking again & really looking forward to another relaxing visit.",October 2015,Katathani Phuket Beach Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g7847985-d540134-Reviews-Katathani_Phuket_Beach_Resort-Kata_Noi_Beach_Karon_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",hotels,5.0,4.5
