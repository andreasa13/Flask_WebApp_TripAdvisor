Hamid. AKA. THE OCEAN OF KNOWLEDGE,"I corresponded with Said several months before our trip. He arranged everything including ferry tickets, guide to meet us at ferry terminal on Tangiers side, excellent lunch at a beautiful restaurant. Hamid has been a guide for thirty years and seems to know everyone and has a personality that allows him to make friends almost immediately. He took us to all the points of interest and explained the history of everything as we traveled. At the end he took us back to the terminal and stayed till we embarked on return ferry. I can highly recommend Said Tours and Hamid.
If you are driving to port of tarifa , there is parking inside the port, limited however. If you get there early as we did then no problem. Get there early as there are a lot of people with baggage, etc, so line can get long. However it seems that they don’t leave till everyone gets on. So while the ride is about an hour, you will spend time going through ticketing and customs on Spain side then customs on Tangiers side.

Unless you really want to spend the day walking take taxi or bus. There is parking just down the street from McDonalds, underground, on Spain side..

BEAUTIFUL HOTEL IN AN EXCELLENT LOCATION,"First let me say that if you are driving into the hotel it can be a little confusing. The hotel is located along a pedestrian only area. When I was driving in I reach 100 feet from entrance but was afraid to enter because of the no go zone signs. There is a parking garage along side the hotel which is where I parked. I found out that you are allowed to enter past the signs if you are going to the hotel. So don’t let the signs stop you.

First Class,"About an hour from the Liberia airport, sitting on 2400 acres. Beautiful location, terrific people working there. Special thanks to Bergen, for his suggestions and help during our stay. Our room at the Tower 2 was excellent, ( adult section). Monkeys, lizards can be seen most days on the property. Plenty of food and lots of things to do. We did book a tour with Erick which was excellent but also used Adrian Arias with Costa Rica Best Choice, 506-8838-1612, also very good.",December 2017,"The Westin Reserva Conchal, an All-Inclusive Golf Resort & Spa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g309242-d2095544-Reviews-The_Westin_Reserva_Conchal_an_All_Inclusive_Golf_Resort_Spa-Playa_Conchal_Province_of_.html,"Playa Conchal, Costa Rica",hotels,5.0,4.5
Somethings change and others don't,"As a boy I spent my summers visiting my Grandad, just outside Nashville. In those days fields of corn and tobacco were everywhere to be seen. Visiting this past weekend I find that those fields are now filled with malls and strip centers. Things have certainly changed. What hasn't changed is the Loveless Café. Located some 20 miles from Nashville on Hwy 100 it has become part of Nashville history. Started in 1951 it is famous for biscuits and home style cooking. Thousands of biscuits are served every day. Upon entering the restaurant you will see walls covered with pictures of all the ""Famous"" people that have visited over the years. Be a part of Nashville history and get a good meal, visit if you can",October 2017,The Loveless Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55229-d435113-Reviews-The_Loveless_Cafe-Nashville_Davidson_County_Tennessee.html,"Nashville, Tennessee",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A MUST VISIT- BUT WITH A GUIDE,"Second time I have been here. This time I used Walks of Italy, skip the line and the underground tour. First you don't want to stand on long lines in July in Rome. Secondly you want a knowledgeable guide to take you and explain to you the history of this magnificent structure.. the tour lasted over three and half hours and included thr Roman forum and palatine hill.",July 2017,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
MUST SEE,Rome is such an amazing place . The Pantheon is one of the top five must visit spots in Rome in my opinion. How the engineers of the time could build the building two thousand years ago is nothing short of mind boggling. Raphael is buried there along with some other notables,July 2017,Pantheon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d197714-Reviews-Pantheon-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent,"We never go to the same restaurant twice while traveling. We have been to Target three times. Lunch and dinner every meal ordered has been very good. Soup, salads pizza, flat bread carrot cake all perfect. Close to the train station, Termini, well worth the a visit",July 2017,Target,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d967428-Reviews-Target-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.0
