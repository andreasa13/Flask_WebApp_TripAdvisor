Worth a visit with kids,After reading such amazing reviews decided to take kids there for lunch. We arrived and told to wait while seats were prepared. The ambience was dead and no action going on with half a dozen people already eating. We were seated and ordered alacarte steak prawn squid and scallops and price very reasonable. After 30 mins we were starting to think nothing was happening. Then the chef finally came and put on a great show and cooked some yummy food. The kids loved every minute of it and the staff went out of their way to celebrate one of my kids birthday with some ice cream and singing. Would have loved to rate this 5 stars if the welcoming was better. More attention and service from the beginning would have made all the difference.,January 2019,Shima Teppanyaki & Shabu Shabu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g469404-d12636123-Reviews-Shima_Teppanyaki_Shabu_Shabu-Seminyak_Kuta_District_Bali.html,"Seminyak, Indonesia",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Amazing every time ... never disappoints,The best breakfast I have eaten. Come here every time visiting Bali and love it every time. Service exceptional food super yummy and presented. Can’t recommend this place enough. If in Bali breakfast is a must. Go early !,January 2019,Sisterfields,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g469404-d6294065-Reviews-Sisterfields-Seminyak_Kuta_District_Bali.html,"Seminyak, Indonesia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fabulous location and decor,Came here with 4 kids for late dinner. Amazing service and comfy setting. Food portions a little small with loads of lettuce and salad (would prefer more calamari). Average value for money when compared to other restaurants in seminyak.,January 2019,The Junction House Seminyak,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g469404-d1545100-Reviews-The_Junction_House_Seminyak-Seminyak_Kuta_District_Bali.html,"Seminyak, Indonesia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Perfect location for walking everywhere,We had one night and wanted to maximize the time for seeing the acropolis and markets. This hotel was perfectly located just in the edge of the square in a quiet lane. We had a view of the acropolis at night which was pretty cool when you arrive. The staff were really friendly and helpful. They recommended a fabulous restaurant in the square that wasn’t one of the bigger looking ones and in a quiet off side street that was family run the food was amazing. The room was small and clean. Comfortable beds pillows and linen. I would stay there again but for the price not sure if there is something a little nicer around but for what we wanted it ticked all the boxes. Overall: amazing location excellent staff and clean comfy beds. Would come back.,September 2018,Arion Athens Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d550796-Reviews-Arion_Athens_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
You have to go .... be there by 830,I am not the tour type of person. I like to visit something wander around for a few hours take loads of pictures to say I’ve been there and head out before all the mania. We slept in a little so was hesitant about going in based on the reviews as my mum recently had knee surgery so didn’t want the mass crowds. We decided to walk up and see how it went. The walk to the ticket office is smooth and gorgeous views. I was pleasantly surprised at only 10 people in line at 845am and a breezy warm morning. We asked up to the acropolis very quickly and yes it was busy but manageable and by no means unbearable. We walked around and sat in a ledge for a few hours and thrilled we went it really is amazing to view the city and see the architecture of this icon. We went in havianas and were perfectly fine. The stones are a little slippery but mainly on the flat areas and not steps. We took bottles of water in our bags that you can buy on the way up as you leave the square and make sure you go to the bathroom there as well as nothing up top. Overall : so glad we did it and had a fabulous experience.,September 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great little cliff side restaurant,"We went here last night late so missed the sunset and had a good experience . The staff are very friendly and realized my daughter was hungry so bought her main quickly. She said it was the best linguine she ever had. We had the tomato balls based on reviews here and they didn’t disappoint they are delish you have to try the. We had the lobster linguine and scallop prawn kebabs and the kebabs were a hit. Lobster was not the best I have had and wouldn’t recommend if you want an amazing seafood dish.
Have given it 4 stars as a few things missed like empty wine glasses on table and didn’t ask if we wanted anymore and no offer of desserts when table cleared. Small things but make the final touches magical. Overall nice place good waiters and flavorsome food.",September 2018,Mezzo Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635864-d3431774-Reviews-Mezzo_Restaurant-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Well worth the visit for some physical fun!,"I read the mixed reviews and wasn’t sure how this would work out but figured it would be a couple of hours fun. We were Well impressed ... the course is put together extremely well and easily filled in a few hours. There are several levels and we had gutsy and confident 5 x 7-12 year olds who went on the blue course which was a challenging first choice and the guide suggested we went in the one lower but all of them handled the course perfectly. The team spend 15 mins training the kids how to clip on and off and manage the zip lines on their own before the set off. There was 5 ziplines and a giant drop along with a massive swing which did freak out the 7 yr old initially but he completed it. Once that was finished in about 45 mins we paid extra 30 kuna each and did the orange course which was a lot more physical and harder work. The guides were there to help if needed and happy we chose a cloudy afternoon as it was very hot. Overall: kids loved it and want to go back, a great way to spend your afternoon doing something fun and physical. Would recommend and go back again.

Amazing hotel,This place was a little more than I would normally spend but so so worth it. From the moment your door is opened for you as you enter it is like this natural oasis that oozes warmth friendliness and a personal touch like no other hotel I have ever experienced. Quick easy check in and upstairs to a simplistic clean and funky designed room. The bed is super comfy with fab sheets and pillows. There is also a big window seat where you can watch the busy streets below. All of the bathroom products are amazing I wanted to take them all home !! Hotel has a buzzy bar and lounge area which is great for chilling and the best chocolate bread pudding ever. Location is awesome right next to Central Park and 15 mins away from time square. The staff are so personal and really care about their customers. I would highly recommend this place I can’t wait to come back and would defiantly pay the extra money again because of the sensational experience.,April 2018,1 Hotel Central Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d6883205-Reviews-1_Hotel_Central_Park-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,5.0,4.5
A unique experience like nothing else.,You can literally sit in this crazy place for hours and watch a city go by with everything happening from a cowboy singing to a dressed up sparkly Statue of Liberty a must do at day time and night time to experience both.

Amazeballs,This is the coolest place. Super cheesy but forces you to have fun and shake your moves while eating breakfast.

Small with an exclusive & modern feel,"Arrived here with 3 kids and were personally taken to our room. There was a personalized chalk welcome board with a bottle of sparkling wine to greet us. We were all impressed with the layout, cleanliness and warm and friendly welcome. Camp is small and fairly quiet but not too far from the busy laguna resort. We rented bikes for a few hours @40 kuna and took a ride around the bays which was a lot of fun. It very busy and packed with people. If you are looking for a very chilled out stay with small clean and funky units then this is a fab choice while traveling around the coast.

Service that leaves an ever lasting impression,I have travelled the world and stayed in multiple luxurious hotels and resorts and this place is exceptional all due to the staff and their sensational service. I am a big believer that you like a place because of the way the people make you feel and you return because you like to come back to what feels familiar and that the people remember you. I was fortunate to meet Payal and Neil who defiantly treated us very well. My son was having surgery and they made really went out of their way to make him feel special and well looked after. The rooms are clean well layed out and the beds are the best hotel beds I have ever slept in ....trust me you will lay down and feel like you are on a cloud. the hotel is very centrally located and walking distance to everything. You wont be disappointed.

Great place with kids for a sundowner,"We came here on a Sunday day night with 5 kids. We had big platters of calamari and nachos with a few cocktails and enjoyed an amazing sunset. I booked a window seat and so glad I did. When we got there someone was sitting at the table and the staff quickly moved and rearranged. The front opens into a Bay Area where a load of local children were swimming so of course it didn't take long for our kids to join them. We had fish n chips and chicken with a sea food chowder and all eaten very quickly. Yummy, well priced and excellent friendly staff. A must visit restaurant when in grand baie.

TIP: Take towels and swimmers in a bag for kids in case they end up swimming.",April 2017,The Beach House Restaurant & Beach Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g488103-d1674515-Reviews-The_Beach_House_Restaurant_Beach_Bar-Grand_Baie.html,Mauritius,restaurants,4.0,4.0
Gorgeous day with kids,"We pulled into this beach by luck and spent the whole day here. It is absolutely gorgeous. A few different water sports and boat options. We rented a glass bottom boat and went out about 15 minutes 50usd the kids aged 5,7,8,10 and jumped in and went snorkelling for about 40 mins and then headed back. They threw bread into the water so lots of fish. A great afternoon and clean beach. We called into a bakery on the way and took a blanket and had a picnic. Highly recommend. TIP: if possible take something to sit on blanket / foldable chairs and plenty of sun cream.",March 2017,Mont Choisy Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304008-d7222303-Reviews-Mont_Choisy_Beach-Mont_Choisy.html,Mauritius,attractions,4.0,4.5
Very impressive,After 10 years of living in dubai I finally went the the burj. I went to the scape restaurant and the food was lovely. We shared a 3 course set menu. Setting was lovely. Service was a real disappointment for. 7 star Hotel. It was slow drinks turned up with entrees they forgot a side dish with the mains didn't come back to ask if we wanted anything else. No pepper salt on table. Asked for it and never bought it. Payment was slow and confusing with discount initially offered then mistake. I found the staff for a 7 star hotel not polished and warm enough with the small attention to detail things and giving you the attention One would expect for high prices in a luxurious hotel and it wasn't busy at all. Would not go back but it is a bucket list for dubai. Maybe we just got a Bad night with staff.,March 2017,Burj Al Arab,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d324445-Reviews-Burj_Al_Arab-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,3.0,4.5
Delightful dumplings,"We have just had dinner here with 3 kids. These dumplings are truly sensational. They are made fresh and piping hot, oozing with flavours. Even my fussy kids ate them. The owner wanders around and chats make recommendations and you get this cozy, relaxed and humble feeling about the place. The price is excellent value for money and the creme brulee OMG it is worth flying to the other side Of the world for ! Cold creme custard with this hot crunchy toffee it was gobbled up within seconds by the kids who haven't stopped talking about it the whole way home. Only downside is no wine or cocktails only juice and beer. A must if a fan of dumplings.",August 2016,Bro Resto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g311298-d10006281-Reviews-Bro_Resto-Canggu_North_Kuta_Bali.html,"Canggu, Indonesia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great place for the day,We came here with 4 kids and grandparents. Was a fun day away and change from the beach. Very Clean and well set up. The kids were off away all day without needing too much supervision. No ques and could see everything from the loungers. Food was good and had excellent music playing all day.

Fun afternoon for kids,Canguu is like this hidden gem and up and coming hippie /surfer heaven. The beach is safe and fun for kids. The afternoon is better when tide is out. Lots of really authentic and unique restaurants. Can easily park the car or get dropped in taxi and walk around. Lots it see and do. Amazing sunsets from beach bar with a Pina colada 2 for 1 at 5pm.

Like being in a rustic shantytown !,Came here last night with 4 kids and they loved it. So much to do and see. Loads of bunnies everywhere for patting and playing. My son got sick after we ordered and the staff were amazing with towels and water. We only had starters and a cocktail but super yummy. The corn fritters are amazing. It was like you are in some remote rice patty with wild frogs and old buildings and candles. The atmosphere is very cool. Highly recommend putting this one on your list in canguu ! Only point noting the mains were not kid friendly and a small selection quite authentic and different.

Love love love !!!!,Came here for breakfast this morning nice and early as had 4 kids. Was filling up when we left. We sat upstairs and we totally loved it. We were overlooking the small village of canguu and had acoustic music playing while waiting for food. The best coffee I have had in Bali so far. Food was so yummy. I have put up pics for the first time on tripadvisor to show as it was really a hit with the whole family. This has to be on your list for brekkie in canguu. I bet you will go back for another round if time permits.

Excellent food and value for money,We came here early as had 4 kids for dinner. We were the first to be upstairs so had excellent service and were very well looked after. As the restaurant got busier the service dropped slightly and empty plates started to load up on table and empty glasses and cutlery all over the place making it so cluttered. Slow with wine refilling and had to ask for a dessert menu. The food is absolutely amazing. I have eaten in many top restaurants around the world and this is really good. If it wasn't for The little attention to detail missing in the service this would have been an exceptional experience. I would go back here and highly recommend.,August 2016,CHANDI,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g469404-d1227829-Reviews-CHANDI-Seminyak_Kuta_District_Bali.html,"Seminyak, Indonesia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Fab food .... Shocking service !!!,We went there about 6pm when half empty ladies standing around everywhere looking miserable. We got taken to a table with 1 seat short and they left so I had to sort my own chair. Our meals orders were taken not a smile in sight or even basic greetings. Food came quickly and was tasty but had no plates for starter and had to ask for plates. No offer for replacement/refill of drinks so their loss. I would go as far as saying staff were rude and really spoiled what could have been a lovely dinner. Good food and setting fun to watch everyone on street.

Thank you tripadvisor,"I have just finished a day at USS with my 5 and 6 year old. I had studied all of the feedback on tripadvisor and so glad I did. Hot tips I would share are :

-Don't buy tickets until you arrive at airport as much cheaper and you can go any day as online you must go on date you book which is good with kids if plan goes pear shaped
- I didn't buy fast pass and glad I didn't as you can buy them all throughout the park if you need to
-go at 9am and have pancakes in a fab place just before the USS gates then get to gates for 9.30 no later
- I went left after Hollywood and started the Madagascar way then forever ever land then Jurassic world just in time for it opening at 11am. This route works perfectly and didn't wait anymore than 15 mins and most times first in the que
- we had lunch at 11.30 before the crowds and then headed out when everyone started to come in for lunch so again missed the ques
- the only one we missed was transformers with a 2 hour wait. So if this is a favorite I would recommend going there first and then headed back in the same route
- take lots of plastic ziplock bags for wet clothes and to protect dry ones
- don't leave for taxi after 4pm as it goes manic. We got there for 3.45 and it was perfect but wow in 15 mins massive long que. the taxi man said this when he dropped us off and really saved us. He said 5.30-6pm also quieter.
- read up on tripadvisor as it really saved me on several factors

Enjoy overall a fun day out for the little ones.",August 2016,Universal Studios Singapore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294264-d2439664-Reviews-Universal_Studios_Singapore-Sentosa_Island.html,"Sentosa Island, Singapore",attractions,4.0,4.5
Average service .... Food ok,Got here at 3.30pm after full day at USS and fairly full. Told a 30 mins wait so sat at the bar. Got set up to drink and eat then got a table straight away so moved. Waited to be served for 20 mins and not that busy . Had burger and Mac and cheese for kids. All good. Wouldn't recommend the banana smoothie it's like Icey and curdled looking. Iced tea with cloves is amazing and so refreshing.

Excellent Family Holiday,"We have just come back from 2 weeks in this villa. There was some confusion with the pick up on arrival and with 4 kids after travelling for 10 hours this was very tough however after severals calls this was resolved relatively quickly.
The villa is just like the pictures and is perfect if travelling with kids.
the staff were friendly and helpful although english was very limited.
The villa location is remote from the main town area but if you rent a car or motorbike this is not a problem.
Close by there are some great Thai resturants and 7/11 shops for groceries.
It says breakfast is included but this is basic cereal and fruits and pancakes so we bought our own food that the maids cooked for some variety.
I would recommend this place and come back in the future.",July 2014,Villa Akasha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1893002-d5600780-Reviews-Villa_Akasha-Choeng_Mon_Bophut_Ko_Samui_Surat_Thani_Province.html,"Choeng Mon, Thailand",hotels,4.0,4.5
