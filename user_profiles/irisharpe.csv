Wow food in a cozy restaurant,"This is the type of restaurant that could be dropped in San Fran and it would fit in perfectly. The small house with a couple of outdoor tables on the porch, a few more inside, the kitchen visible from all tables, the decor, the incredible food. We very much enjoyed the banter with the host and waitstaff. Very personable group. The four of us all had different soups, salads and entrees and we were all impressed with the presentations, flavors and portion sizes. This place is a gem. Highly recommend.",September 2020,Cooks' House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g42758-d1182837-Reviews-Cooks_House-Traverse_City_Grand_Traverse_County_Michigan.html,"Traverse City, Michigan",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great home base for ""Wining"" in Leelenau","My wife and I spent one night here in early September. We stayed in the Betelgeuse suite. Very large and well-appointed room with a comfortable king sized bed. The only drawback to the room was the rather skinny shower. Let's just say she fit alot better than I did in it! We were greeted warmly by the check-in person. Easy to get the bags up the the room and parking is right next to the building. We very much enjoyed the afternoon snack and free half carafe of wine apiece. The tasting room and restaurant were less than 100 yards from the steps of the Inn which made getting a few drinks and dinner easy as could be.
We walked a couple of the paths through the woods and vineyard and walked amongst the horses as well. It is a very pastoral, relaxing setting.
The breakfast was incredible. Homemade pumpkin creme brulee french toast with a fruit compote, chantilly cream and bacon. WOW!
Strongly recommend that if you can get a room here, do it as it is quite close to all the wineries you would want to visit on Leelenau and the setting, rooms and food are wonderful.",September 2020,The Inn at Black Star Farms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g42743-d258470-Reviews-The_Inn_at_Black_Star_Farms-Suttons_Bay_Leelanau_County_Michigan.html,"Suttons Bay, Michigan",hotels,4.0,5.0
Beautiful house and wonderful host,"We stayed one night in the Library and Wedding Suite. It is in the basement. Very mild musty smell. The room(s) themselves are massive. Very comfortable leather couch in the library area. Wine glasses and ice bucket available. New flat screen tv with too many movie choices to count. Bathroom was clean and all in good working order. The bed was comfortable. Temp in the room was spot on. Breakfast was a pleasant experience. Good quiche and yummy banana nut bread along with numerous other pastries and fresh fruit. We definitely recommend this place as a pleasant, low stress alternative to hotels in the area.",October 2019,Old Northside Bed and Breakfast Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g37209-d76305-Reviews-Old_Northside_Bed_and_Breakfast_Inn-Indianapolis_Indiana.html,"Indianapolis, Indiana",hotels,4.0,4.5
Lovely wine tour,"My wife and I were fortunate enough to have this 3 winery tour recommended to us by our concierge. Iliana picked us up at our hotel and took us on a tour of 3 wineries with an incredible amount of information shared throughout on the wines, vineyards, history of not just the wine production on the island but the island itself and people of the island.
We got the best tables at each winery (Gavalos, Gaia and Sigalas) and received tastings of at least 4 wines at each stop. Gaia was our favorite due to its setting and wines.
It was so wonderful to get a better understanding of each wine and the people behind each wine. This was so much better than going on our own and trying to understand the wines by reading about them. She shared so much of the backstory on each it actually made us appreciate the wines that much more.
We highly recommend a half day with Iliana if you want to really learn about Santorini and its wine culture.",October 2019,Santorini Wine Trails,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482942-d6936769-Reviews-Santorini_Wine_Trails-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great view and service. Decent food,"Dinner here with my wife. Incredible view of the caldera. Good wine list. Attentive waitstaff.
Food was hit and miss. Santorini salad and shrimp risotto were decent and octopus appetizer was quite good . They did not have the trofie with cuttlefish so I went with the squid with lentils. I just found the flavor lacking though the lentils were good texture wise. Tough to know if the good is the standard but with all the other choices available, we wouldn’t return here.",October 2019,Character Italian Restaurant & Lounge Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d3464422-Reviews-Character_Italian_Restaurant_Lounge_Bar-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Perfect lunch spot,"Upon arrival in Santorini, we had some time to kill as our room was not yet ready. Our concierge recommended Aktaion for lunch. Very quaint little place right on the path to Fira from Imerovigli. 6 tables outside and maybe 5 inside. We got a table outside to enjoy the weather and view. Nice wine list with mostly local Greek wines.
We had a Greek salad, octopus appetizer and loukoumades with a bottle of recommended Rose. All were wonderful. Nikos, our waiter, was on the ball and very friendly. We were glad we got to get here and recommend anyone else do as well.",October 2019,Aktaion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635607-d1787767-Reviews-Aktaion-Firostefani_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wow,"Wow as far as the view, wow as far as the service and wow as far as the food. We were about 20 minutes late for our 6:30 our reservation as we thought it was booked for 7. They still had our table on the rail for us. So nice.
They have a wonderful wine list with a great range of choices. We had a crab appetizer that was phenomenal and monkfish and amberjack for dinner. Both of which were among the best we have ever had.
Our waitress and assistants as well as the sommelier were very helpful and friendly. We recommend a dinner at La Maison if you have the chance.",October 2019,La Maison,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635864-d1775748-Reviews-La_Maison-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
As good as it gets,"My wife and I were blessed to spend 4 incredible days at the Vasilicos this month. Fiorela is the concierge who made all our plans beforehand including a winery tour, sunset cruise, dinner reservations and airport transfers. She was quick to respond to my emails with all the information we needed and recommendations that did not disappoint. Our private airport transfer was waiting for us even though our flight from Athens was over an hour delayed.
I booked Efta because of its privacy and availability of the private plunge pool. There are about 50 more steps to take compared to the other rooms but once you get there, it’s completely worth it. You are basically all alone with a full view of the caldera from the patio and pool. Nothing in front or below you other than the cliff. Just breathtaking. The king bed was very comfortable. Take advantage of the pillow menu before you arrive. Plenty of room in the room for the two of us. The safe and hairdryer work well. The window in the bathroom allows for a caldera view while showering.
We did the bread and breakfast option so breakfast on the patio every day was an experience. Fresh fruit, pastries, charcuterie, jams, yogurt, honey, coffee, juices and eggs to order brought down by Adi with his smiling face and lovely personality.
As mentioned we did a winery tour, sunset cruise and 2 dinners out (La Maison was our favorite). These are all covered in separate reviews. We walked into Fira a couple of times (15 minutes) as well as out to Skaros Rock (30 minutes). Bring good walking/hiking shoes if you plan to do the latter. The paths into the towns are mostly cobblestone, rather irregular with many slopes/steps so make sure your dinner shoe wear is appropriate.
We did a dinner at the hotel on our last night. It would have been on our patio but it was incredibly windy that whole day and evening so we moved it up to the reception area which worked out well. We were able to pick our appetizers and mains a couple of days beforehand. The shrimp saganaki and white grouper were very good but the stars were the octopus appetizer and the scallops. Absolutely incredible. Topped off by one of their winery’s wines and a chocolate volcano cake? It was perfect.
Checkout was a breeze and our early transfer back to the airport was waiting for us. It was so nice to have such a well handled 4 days by such kind, professional people. We can not recommend the Vasilicos high enough.",October 2019,The Vasilicos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d7732273-Reviews-The_Vasilicos-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Incredible in every way,"GB is a high end restaurant with high end prices that deserves to be noted as one of the best in Athens. Without the setting it would be wonderful but when you add the view of the Acropolis, it becomes an over the top experience.
The waitstaff and mature d’ ensure you will be treated as honored guests from your arrival forward. We experienced nothing but smiles and helpful insight from all of them.
The bar and wine list is extensive.
We had the Greek salad and calamari starters, mullet, sea bass and pork cheeks for mains and le Macao for dessert. Each and every dish was presented beautifully and was an experience of flavor.
We recommend GB as highly as possible.",October 2019,GB Roof Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1048185-Reviews-GB_Roof_Garden-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Cool little place,"Good setting though there is no view of “the sights” here. They’ve created a pleasant rooftop setting in the center of the tourist area that provides a respite from the hustle downstairs. The waitstaff was too notch. Wine selection was high quality. We had the seafood saganaki and octopus starters. Both were quite good. Our mains were the sea food pasta, sea bass and lamb. All were prepared well and we had no complaints. If you want a bit of a break from the hustle and bustle of the tourist scene and don’t mind not seeing the Acropolis for one meal, this is a great option.",October 2019,Balcony Restaurant & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10689208-Reviews-Balcony_Restaurant_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Incredible setting with great food,"First off, we stayed at the Herodion so this was an easy choice for us. I can’t imagine any roof top bar and restaurant have a better view of the Acropolis than Point a. Our table was right on the railing so we were able to watch the Parthenon change as the sun set.
The hostess, bartenders, waitresses and waiters were all professional, helpful and friendly.
The loukoumades and sea bass ceviche were great starters. We enjoyed all 3 mains (pork, cod and lamb) and the chocolate mousse dessert was good (and huge).

More tactile history,"The Agora is different from the Acropolis in that while many structures are less impressive, you can actually walk through and touch almost all of it. Only the Odeion and Temple of Hephaestus are roped off. The map and guide they give do help but you still may feel a bit like you’re not sure what you’re seeing unless you take the time to orient yourself. 2 hours is probably plenty of time here depending on your interest level.",October 2019,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
History in plain view,"The fact that this place is so well preserved after 2500 years is incredible to me. I recommend entering the east/south entrance as it was much less busy and allows an easy walk to the theatre of Dionysus and Odeion of Herodus Atticus without having to backtrack. You still enter the west gate with the crowd but you avoid the ticket buying crowd at the main gate. Once you get through the bottleneck at the west gate, the entire Acropolis opens up and there is plenty of space to explore all it has to offer. We entered around 10 am on a Sunday and while it took about 10 minutes to get into the west gate once we got there, we didn’t find the crowds overwhelming.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Perfect locale,"My wife and I spent 3 days in Athens and chose Herodion due to its location and price. We feel like we made a great choice. Our only hiccup was our transfer from the airport to the hotel was not at the airport when we arrived. We called the hotel after 15 minutes and they apologized and had a car there in 20 minutes. Room was not ready but we were fully expecting that given our arrival time. We took a short walk to Hadrian’s Arch and the Temple of Zeus. After a lunch at one of the many places between the hotel and those spots, we went back to the room and it was ready. Friendly front desk and bell staff were efficient.
Room was a standard king size on 3rd floor with all the necessary requirements. Good quality shower, bed was decent if not plush and all the facilities were in good working order. Safe worked well as did the hairdryer.
We were able to walk about 10 minutes to the Acropolis and the museum. The Agora was about 15-20 minutes as was the Plaka, national gardens and Panathenaic Stadium. We enjoyed the hot tubs on the 4th floor with views to the Acropolis (especially after walking the hills and steps of the area). They were clean and in good working order.
The lobby bar was a pleasant area for pre-dinner drinks each evening and their restaurant, Point a, was fantastic! Incredible setting so close to the Acropolis.
Taxis were only 2 minutes away at any time so our ride back to the airport was seamless.",October 2019,Herodion Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228864-Reviews-Herodion_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Lovely stay with lovely people,"Barb and Bill have a lovely home and setting for their B & B. They are such a welcoming and friendly couple. They made us feel right at home. We were in the Mackinac room. Very clean with a comfortable king bed as well as our own bathroom a few steps away. The breakfasts were varied and quite tasty!

Family Spring Break 2019,"Our family of 4 (daughters aged 14 and 11) stayed 6 nights at the Grand Moon Palace. We booked through the Palace Resorts website and made use of their app during our stay. I pre-booked our transportation with their group and that was handled smoothly. We were in the van within 5 minutes of clearing customs in Cancun.
We arrived at 12:30. The room was not ready (understandably) so we spent some time exploring, having lunch and just generally chilling out. A minor annoyance at check-in is a representative giving a short talk about the resort credits and offering a chance to earn more by attending a 90 minute breakfast and tour of the resort. We needed neither but he was persistent (and repeated about 20 times how he wasn’t selling time shares-which we knew he wasn’t but anyway) so we finally said sure, sign us up (knowing we weren’t going to go).
We stayed in building 94 overlooking the pond like structures slightly closer to the beach than the water park. There was no noise to speak of from the water park and I would even consider the porch area peaceful with only the occasional golf cart going by to break the sound of classical music and birds. The room was completely quiet. Everything was in working order, clean and up to date. Bathroom had double sinks, huge shower with good pressure and a separate (small) area for the toilet. Double lounger on the porch with 2 additional chairs was appreciated. Fridge had coke, Pepsi, water, diet dr. Pepper, sprite, corona, bud and bud light and tonic water. Mini bar had Bacardi, Jose, Stoli and a cheapish scotch. Only issue we had with the room was it wasn’t cleaned until about 6-7 pm daily (and was missed once). There is a button to push at the front door when you leave for the day to let them know it’s ready for cleaning, but that didn’t seem to matter.
We spent most of our time at the pool and beach by Cusco. Pool was clean, chairs were plentiful and the bartenders and wait staff are quick and friendly. Beware the fancy covered chairs-they are meant for Palace Elite members only. We would see several people shooed from them every day. My wife and I started betting on how long it would take for them to be noticed. The water is seaweedy but most know that about this area. The beach itself has some of the softest sand around.
Meals were a highlight here. We generally did breakfast at the grand buffet or Cusco buffet (myriad of food choices at both including omelettes to order). Great service at both places. If we had lunch it was at Los Tacos (awesome) or the Beach Club (also awesome). You could also grab a plate and hit Cusco’s lunch buffet and bring it out to your lounge if you desired.
We had dinner at Cusco (Peruvian mostly small and incredibly tasty plates), Jade (Asian with a twist that was excellent), Caribeno (decent selection of Caribbean inspired dishes), La Cantina (casual Mexican restaurant with incredible service and great food) and JC (poor imitation of an American steakhouse with low quality cuts and the blandest cocktail sauce in recorded history-they call it Indianapolis style shrimp cocktail. We’re from Indy and if they want to have some real sauce, we’d be happy to send them some St. Elmo’s sauce so they know what they need to do). All service was attentive although again JC was the weakest in that category.
The highlight of our meals was the romantic dinner I had arranged weeks before arrival at the Beach Club for my wife’s bday. The menu was escargot with cheese mousse and grapefruit, mixed greens with olive tampanade, tuna with avocado mousse and radish, 3 Cheese soup with grapes and flat crouton, filet with lobster tail and finally
creme brûlée and chocolate ice cream. All courses were incredible. Our waitress Saida was very sweet and kudos to chef Victor and head waiter Ricardo for making the night so wonderful. The sax player was a great touch as well.
Our only issue was our 14 year old has an allergy to tree nuts. She’s learned what to avoid but grabbed a blueberry smoothie one day at breakfast that had “cereals” in it. She did ok after a few hours so I caution anyone out there to stay on the lookout. If we had asked what the cereals were I’m sure they would have told us so that’s really on us. All of the a la carte restaurants did a great job of advising us if something she ordered was risky or not.",April 2019,The Grand At Moon Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d13138532-Reviews-The_Grand_At_Moon_Palace-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",hotels,4.0,5.0

Jacob was so very pleasant and informative. We had a beautiful sunny day at the bridges and were able to see an entire family of howler monkeys, tarantula, guan, bats, eyelash viper and a multitude of other flora and fauna. He was amazing at sighting the wildlife in the forest. They even made a special stop on the drive to lunch where they thought a sloth had been and lo and behold, it was there. Lunch was incredible and I dare say as good or better than the food at our resort. The waterfall tour was impressive. COLD water and such a sight to behold in the middle of the rainforest.

Pura Vida,"My wife and I just returned after celebrating our 15th anniversary at Nayara Springs. We could not have been more pleased with our week. Review by category (this is long):
Pre-arrival: I made reservations by the hotel website. We did the included breakfast and dinner rate. I arranged for land transfer from San Jose to Nayara ($182 each way for both of us). I also arranged for the romantic dinner on the date of our anniversary. My contact was Valery P. who was so very helpful in answering the multitude of questions I had. All she promised was done and the transfers were smooth and well-timed.
Arrival/Room: As stated, our ride to Nayara was well planned. It took about 2.5 hours. Mountainous and twisty most of the way. No stops but our driver offered to stop for a break if we needed it. Our room was not quite ready, so Manrique helped us get settled to the property and got us a free coffee drink from Mi Cafecto. The room was ready in about 20 minutes. Jeison took us to our room with Manrique. The villa was perfect. It is basically split into two areas. As you enter, one side is the bedroom with a king size bed looking out to the large deck with huge plunge pool, hammock and large bed with table and two chairs. That area is well covered by an overhang to the pool can be enjoyed even in the rain. The rest of the bedroom has a small desk and chair as well as an area with flat screen tv, coffee table, chair and couch. Bed is a 4 poster with sheer curtains that can be dropped for full coverage or tied up and out of the way. 4 large pillows provided (they do flatten out easily, so as someone who likes to be more propped up, I found myself wadding them up during the night. the opposite side of the villa contains the indoor 2 headed rain shower with large sinks (one with a seat for those that like to sit to get ready) on either side of that, two large closets with more than enough shelving to the side, a medium sized fridge and minibar with nespresso machine and snacks. The toilet is just off that area and is the only part of the peaked rook structure with its own separation by drop roof and door so it is completely enclosed while the rest of the room is open the the peaked roof above about 9-10 feet. The outdoor shower is directly outside the indoor shower and is accessed by 2 doors on either side of the indoor shower. This and the plunge pool were our favorite parts. It was so exhilarating to be outdoors but have the areas be so completely private.
Food/drink: We were in villa 17 which is about 100 feet from the main pool as well as Mis Amores open air restaurant that serves breakfast from 6:30 and only closes at 6:00 pm. We had breakfast there several days. This generally consisted of FRESH fruit, pastries and options for granola, french toast, eggs prepared to order or a black bean, egg and cheese dish. Good deal of a la carte choices. Brayan and William were awesome and by day 2, knew my wife needed the big french press for her coffee. We spent most of the days at this pool (Cielto Lindo). Great selection of drinks with top shelf alcohol. The seats and tables in the pool allowed for one to stay cool under the umbrellas but in the pool as well while reading, etc. The staff here were exceptional as well and we appreciated trainee Roy and Nereyda learning that my order was a Pirate Ship with a shot of rum back after only a day. Great selection of craft beers here as well. We did have breakfast at Altimira on 2 occasions and were quite impressed. This was buffet style with all manner of fruit, pastries, hot dishes, omelettes/eggs to order. If it had been closer to us (it is on the family side), we probably would have gone here more. We did all the restaurants but the wine bar. Asia Luna had wonderful sushi and bowls. Cool little spot as well. Altimira was good and was highlighted by a banana flambe dessert. Our favorite was Amor Loco. Great fresh fish options for both appetizers and main courses. Norlan, who was our waiter here, became like a friend who helped me with my admittedly pitiful Spanish. Tatiana made awesome cafe flambes. There is a live musician(s) here every night. There is outdoor (covered) or indoor seating available. The romantic dinner was prepared by Diego and we were looked after by Daniella. The food we chose beforehand (Valery gave me a menu to choose from weeks in advance of our stay). We made a point to choose different things for each of our 4 courses so we could try it all-no disappointments in any of the 8 dishes. It really is a romantic setting as it is only the couple in a small room overlooking the rainforest with only candles providing the lighting and only the waitress interacting with you. And finally, don't forget FREE GELATO everyday from 2-5 in Mi Cafecto! Diana here was so friendly every day.
Grounds: I marvel at how someone came up with the idea to build this place, how the plan was put down and how it was executed. We walked most places but do not feel like taking the golf cart is a cop out. The hills are steep and if it has rained, discretion is the better part of valor. We were fortunate enough to see both a howler monkey and one of the sloths during our stay. We made use of the yoga studio and gym. Both incredibly clean and well maintained. The flora here is breathtaking as well.
Excursions: We did the hanging bridges and Arenal waterfall combo private tour. It was well worth it. Our guide was incredibly informative (he majored in eco-tourism in college) and made great use of his scope to find, point out and take pictures of so much wildlife on the tour. The lunch provided was one of our best meals as well! There are about 500 steps down to the waterfall, so be prepared for that. We also recommend a visit to Down to Earth coffee to get a real idea of the coffee life in Costa Rica. It is run by a couple and is basically like a craft brewery or winery would be here in the states.
Our stay was the week of relaxation with some exploration that we really needed. I cannot recommend Nayara Springs highly enough. I hope all those mentioned here and those whose names I neglected to remember know how special they make their guests feel.",October 2018,Nayara Springs Relais & Châteaux,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g309226-d4367721-Reviews-Nayara_Springs_Relais_Chateaux-La_Fortuna_de_San_Carlos_Arenal_Volcano_National_Park_P.html,"La Fortuna de San Carlos, Costa Rica",hotels,5.0,5.0

The grounds are likewise wonderful. The view from the back deck to the Tetons was great for an early morning coffee and a late night beverage. The hot tub was a hit with our girls in the evening as well. The pictures are views from the deck toward the Tetons.
The best part about Teton View however, are your gracious, friendly, accommodating, informative and helpful (could use more adjectives here but you get the picture) hosts. Carol and Franz were so wonderful to us from the moment of arrival to the minute we departed. The breakfasts and snacks they provide are really incredible. You can feel how much they love what they do in how easy they make it look. Their recommendations for activities and restaurants were spot on. The ability to use all the books and maps they have on site made detail planning easy.
While we didn’t get to see the moose this time, our girls felt like Blanca was a more than worthy substitute! We recommend Teton View as highly as possible.",July 2018,Teton View Bed & Breakfast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60574-d83926-Reviews-Teton_View_Bed_Breakfast-Wilson_Jackson_Hole_Wyoming.html,"Wilson, Wyoming",hotels,5.0,5.0
Good Italian food in a wonderful setting,"Family of 4 ate here twice in 3 nights while visiting the area. Very much enjoyed the octopus appetizer, lasagna and rigatoni. Kiddo’s spaghetti and meatball was also a hit. Wine list was adequate and really well priced. Staff was friendly as well.",July 2018,Calico Restaurant and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60574-d397956-Reviews-Calico_Restaurant_and_Bar-Wilson_Jackson_Hole_Wyoming.html,"Wilson, Wyoming",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Decent food and beer. Cool setting.,Had dinner here one night during our visit to the area. We are a couple of hop heads so we were looking for someplace to get a good IPA and/or pale ale. We agree the IPA was decent but the hop content was lacking. The pale revealed almost no hop content to our palates unfortunately. Food was good. They make an effort to improve upon standard bar fare and are successful. The setting is cool with plenty of outdoor relaxation area while waiting for a table. Waitstaff was fine but not overly friendly.,July 2018,Snake River Brewing Co,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60491-d512828-Reviews-Snake_River_Brewing_Co-Jackson_Jackson_Hole_Wyoming.html,"Jackson, Wyoming",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Wonderful staff-building needs upgrades,"Family of 4 stayed 4 nights in a 2 room suite in mid-July. Entire staff from front desk to bell staff to bartender in the map room to restaurant staff were wonderful. Always a smiling face and always willing to meet any request.
The main floor of the hotel is beautiful and seems to have been refurbished rather recently. The rooms (only judging by ours) are in dire need of the same care. Outdated and worn furniture was the decor. Bathrooms had poor plumbing pressure. During our July visit, temps were in the high 80s each day. A small table top oscillating fan was provided but was woefully inadequate as the room temps didn’t drop under 80 until well into the early morning hours even with the windows wide open. I wouldn’t expect a/c as I doubt it’s necessary very often but more or larger fans (ceiling fans) would be a welcome addition to the rooms.
This spot is a good base for the Lamar Valley and of course the mammoth springs but I would look at the Old Faithful Inn or Canyon Village as they are more centrally located. Road construction on the way from mammoth to Norris really affected travel. That includes a complete closure of the road from 10 pm-7 am. Watch out for that if making dining reservations at OFI in the evening as your drive back could be a long detour in the dark (good way to spot wildlife though!)
The scenery was wonderful around the hotel. There seems to be a dozen strong elk herd that has colonized the grounds. Very fun to watch (from a distance).",July 2018,Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel & Cabins,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60999-d220054-Reviews-Mammoth_Hot_Springs_Hotel_Cabins-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming",hotels,3.0,3.5
Good food and great staff,"Our family of 4 stayed at Mammoth for 4 nights and ate breakfast here each morning and dinner 2 nights. To a person the staff here are lovely.
We enjoyed the choices at the breakfast buffet (2 types of scrambled eggs daily, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, French toast, pastries, fruit, yogurt, cereal, granola and oatmeal (on request). We also tried the chocolate chip pancakes and smoked trout with bagel off the regular menu and those were also good.
Dinner was also good (highlighted by the sweet potato soup) though the meatloaf was dry. No complaints from the kids menu users.",July 2018,Mammoth Hotel Dining Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60999-d519502-Reviews-Mammoth_Hotel_Dining_Room-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Best meal at Yellowstone,"Had a wonderful dinner here our last night in the park. Family of 4 all did the buffet (although the osso bucco almost got me). I recommend arriving early, taking in the beauty of the lobby, maybe enjoying a drink on the patio and watching Old Faithful go off before dinner if the timing works.
The check in and waitstaff were friendly, engaging and ready to answer questions. The buffet had a slew of choices. These included chips with black bean dip, red pepper gouda bisque, salad with all the toppings and dressings possible, bbq chicken, trout, prime rib, baked beans, mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, rice pilaf, green bean almondine, roasted baby carrots, a fruit crumble and chocolate chip bread pudding. I’m sure I’ve missed a few. Decent wine and beer list as well. We would most definitely recommend this for at least a one time experience.",July 2018,Old Faithful Inn Dining Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60999-d518895-Reviews-Old_Faithful_Inn_Dining_Room-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming",restaurants,5.0,3.5
New hotel seemingly not finished,"Family of 4 here for 2 nights. Stayed in a suite with kitchenette. Bedding, shower, sink, fridge and tv all in good working order/comfortable.
Staff are great. All we encountered were smiling and seemingly happy to help with any questions.
The issues with this hotel judging by our room is that the contractor(s) and after construction inspectors didn’t complete some jobs. Just in our room, 2 of 4 doors could not be opened/closed properly without a great deal of force, the laminate flooring in the kitchenette area was not secured and could be slid out of place by several inches, a sliding door could not be kept on its tracks, the shower head was off center and the shower rod sagged. These didn’t affect out stay but made me wonder what else was completed inadequately in the rest of the hotel.
The pool area and workout area were clean and the hot tub worked well. Breakfast was typical and the area was clean.
All in all, great staff, good sleep but maybe opened too early?",July 2018,Residence Inn by Marriott Denver Airport at Gateway Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29144-d601511-Reviews-Residence_Inn_by_Marriott_Denver_Airport_at_Gateway_Park-Aurora_Colorado.html,"Aurora, Colorado",hotels,3.0,4.5
Overnight for ND women’s hoops,"Our family, including 10 and 13 year old daughters stayed in a suite with sofa bed one night this past week. Exceptional bell, valet and front desk staff. All very friendly and eager to help. Room was clean and everything in proper working order. New, large TVs in both rooms. King size bed was quite comfortable. Bathroom was large and clean as well. We ate dinner pre-game at Rohr’s. Quite a good selection for adults and kiddos. Food was really good. Waitstaff was good (though they forgot our app-not a huge deal). Adults had drinks later and service was a bit spotty but there was a pre-wedding gathering that was good size monopolizing much of the waitstaff’s time, which was understandable. Checkout was a breeze.

3 Day Family Weekend,"Family (2 daughters aged 13 and 11) spent another wonderful weekend at the Ritz Carlton. We used mobile check in which made it incredibly easy. Arrived at 12:30 not expecting the room to be ready, but since I had put in 1:00 as expected arrival, it was. Simply picked up the keys and we were good to go. We did valet the car (included in the package rate) and both drop off and pick up were smoothly done. Room was exactly as advertised. 2 room suite on the 30th floor with views to the north to the lake and Hancock building. Everything functioned properly and the room was immaculate (and kept that way throughout our stay by the staff). We included the club lounge on the 15th floor in our package as well. That was our best perk of this trip. Breakfast was really good-plenty of hot and cold choices including bacon, oatmeal, sausage, croissant sandwiches, potatoes, cereals, fruit, smoked salmon with capers, multiple pastries, juices, coffees, teas and milk. It was never crowded. We also made use of it for dinner once (they advertise hors d'oeuvres but to be honest, there was plenty for dinner if you want it to be and the kiddos like it as well) and cocktail hour in the evenings. Great beer and wine choices as well as quality spirits and liqueurs. All is included in the package rate.
Of course the proximity to Michigan Avenue (and Ghirardelli's) is a main drawing point for us.
A special shout out to Pierre, the concierge at the Club Lounge. He is everything one should be as far as service and hospitality go. He even had the staff make a special dessert for our 13 year old as part of this stay was to celebrate her birthday. He was so personable and helpful as well.

3 night with family in Nashville,"We spent a Thursday-Sunday in Nashville for a fall break. Stayed in the Magnolia/Garden area. Room was 2 queens with an atrium view (5th floor). We chose not to have room serviced to earn more Marriott points. The room was clean and linens were well maintained. TV was quite large for the room. Shower was clean with good water pressure. Small bathroom but an extra sink outside the main bathroom that had a mirror helped. Mini-fridge was properly cold. Beds were comfortable as were pillows. Little balcony was a nice touch with space for 2 chairs and small table.
We ate at Solario (pretty decent Mexican food for a hotel and a HUGE tequila list), Fuse (typical sports bar food wise but over 75 TVs), cascades for breakfast daily had above average buffet food and very friendly servers. Our favorite was The Library where we had after dinner drinks. Very cool vibe with pleasant bartenders.
Valet was quick and drivers were friendly.
Did online app check in which worked as it should have.
Easy walking distance to Grand Ole Opry and the mall.
Overall this made a comfortable base of operations and we enjoyed the impressive atrium(s) and the pleasant staff. A special shout out to David who was our breakfast waiter at Cascades.

"As a history buff, I was hoping for a bit more","Visit started with a long line for tickets that we (and according to the staff, they) were not expecting. Should have bought online as we could have walked right in (take heed). The handheld audio devices worked well. I would advise lingering at each numbered site to listen when on the grounds as some are very close together and if you keep walking, you'll pass by other posts and possibly miss something.
We watched the duel and the 2 young men did a decent job of explaining duels including details I had never realized.
The house tour felt rushed, unfortunately (possibly due to how busy they were). The gardens were lovely. We definitely enjoyed how much of Rachel's story they included on the tour.

Base for 3 days in Dublin,"Travel party of 3 (my 3rd time in Ireland, my wife's second and my 19 year old son's first) really enjoyed Brooks. We drove but found the hotel and car park with only a little difficulty. Front desk and valets were friendly and helpful. Room was clean. We had a queen bed with a twin bed and had plenty of room for the 3 of us. Bathroom and its amenities were great. Only complaint was the shower curtain liked to join you as you cleaned yourself. Included breakfast of buffet and hot breakfast was very good with great selections. The hotel is right in the middle of Dublin and makes sightseeing very easy. We did a Hop-on Hop-off with the green bus team and it worked out very well.

Wanted to stay longer,"We were a travel party of 3 (myself, wife and 19 year old son). Self drive tour of Ireland with 2 days/nights in Cork. Would have loved to have stayed longer and part of that reason was the way we were welcomed and treated at Hayfield Manor. Not once were we made to feel anything less than special by the staff.
Room was large with high quality linens and finishings. King sized bed with a twin bed as well and still more than enough room for the 3 of us. Huge bathroom with bath slippers and thick bathrobes. Wifi was spot on. Sleep quality was great as the beds were very comfortable.
Hotel itself has a good size indoor pool, sauna, steam room and outdoor jacuzzi. All were clean and in good working order. The grounds were spectacular with some of the largest hydrangeas we saw on our whole trip.
Breakfast was included and was a combo of buffet for fruit, juices and many pastries with a choice of multiple hot breakfasts as well. Food was very good. We did dinner at Orchids and it was also very, very good. Bar service was attentive. Prices were what you should expect at a high end hotel.

Nice home base for a non-Disney vacation,"For the first time in 10 years, we did not spend SB on Disney property. Wanted a change of pace. Booked a SeaWorld/Discovery Cove package on the SW website and this is one of their hotels. The place is massive but given the friendliness of all the staff, you feel like you are being welcomed home. You will share the hotel with plenty of conventioneers but the size of the place makes it easy to do so.
Our check-in was smooth due to the help of Isabella. Alexis was our concierge contact and made navigating SeaWorld easy (get the meal plan if you plan on eating there for more than 1 meal and definitely get the free Quick Queues at the hotel-only Mako is omitted but the QQ that includes it at the park is $19.99).
Tradewinds has typical breakfast buffet fare but the omelettes to order and the made to order pancakes and waffles were a hit with our crew. The pool is quite large and we never had to fight for chairs no matter the time of day. Responsive pool waitstaff and poolside restaurant waitstaff. Pretty decent food there as well. The sports bar had higher quality food than I expected-grouper sandwich was tasty and huge.
Room was clean, well appointed and we had no issues. Note the room service menu is a tiny pamphlet not a huge folder, so we didn't notice if for a few days. Workout facility is massive and has high quality machines.
Valet staff is quick and polite-always ready to provide directions. $32 per night for valet, $22 for self park. SW is right across the street. Discovery Cove is a mile away. Aquatica about a mile and a half. Took an hour to drive to Cape Canaveral.

Breakfast is served as soon as you check in. Then you pick out a beach chair(s)-they have towels there. They recommend the animal friendly sunscreen (tip, reapply often and it goes on thick!). Pick a vest or wetsuit for the day as you need them anytime you're in the water with animals. The dolphin swim experience is good. The trainers are very much excited for you to have a good time and to educate you about the dolphins and what they are doing with and for the dolphins. The reef is a good experience, especially for children (or adults) who have never snorkeled. Actually a good variety of fish, including rays, to view. No limit on how long or how often you can snorkel. Water ranges from 2 feet to about 12 feet deep. The snacks, drinks (including alcohol) through the day that are included is nice. Lunch is typical resort fare but done well. Don't think you get to swim with otters-they are on the other side of a glass barrier in the ""lazy river"" area but were more interested in napping the few times we checked on them.
