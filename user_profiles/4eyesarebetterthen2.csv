Good Pizza,My husband and I with my friend who lives in St. Augustine went to Borrillo's in November 2018. We have been there several times in the past. They make their own pizza dough on site. A variety menu for all. The prices are average. It is not a fancy place but if you want good pizza this is the place to go. And the locals go there too such as my friend. It is located on the main street in St Augustine. The staff are friendly.

Something For Everyone,We have been dealing with Kay's since 2006 in the Caribbean. Our last visit was November 2018.

You do not get pressured to buy something like some other jewelry stores do. Their prices are good and you get treated well.

Something for Everyone,"In May, my husband and I were Krakow, Poland. We visited The Cloth Hall. Everything that is for sale has been made in Poland. The craftmenship is wonderful on all of the products. Great place to pick up a gift for someone or yourself. Outside in the Town Square, there cafes set up for eating or drinking. I was impressed with the beauty of the flowers that surround these cafes. It was a nice touch. On one of the side streets leading to the square is a bakery. The display case almost sits of the sidewalk and is lined with a variety of delicious looking donuts. There are a number of places to shop, get coffee or sit and enjoy the day in the Town Square. I recommend the area and would visit again when in Krakow.",May 2018,Sukiennice (Cloth Hall),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274772-d276743-Reviews-Sukiennice_Cloth_Hall-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",attractions,5.0,4.0

Never Again Would Stay,"My husband and I did a land tour and one of the hotels we stayed in was Plaza Alto Hotel in Prague. I requested a shower and traded with the coach driver with the approval of the desk clerk. Our room was sub standard. Night table next to bed was missing. We went to the desk. As I approached the desk, the women desk clerk looked at me and said ""you are the women who had to have a shower"" in a loud and nasty voice. Then the male clerk started shouting in a loud and nasty voice ""you got a shower what more do you want""? I asked nicely if I could have a night table for my side of the bed. You could see that at one time there was a table from the indentations in the carpet. The male desk clerk kept yelling. I told him this is no was to treat guests. As I walked away the female clerk yelled ""you can't have a table from the lobby"". We have traveled for many years and have stayed in many hotels and have never been treated like this. It has never occurred to me to ask for a lobby table or receive one. I did not tell them that our TV did not work or the toilet seat was falling off. I waited for the night clerk to come on duty and told him about the toilet seat. He said someone would be there in the morning to fix it. It was never fixed and we were there for 2 days. In the morning our coach group and other guests were having breakfast in the dining room. When one of our fellow tour guests asked the busboy if he would clean off a table since there was no other place to sit. His response was to yell""OK, OK, OK"". This was disruptive to the other guests trying to eat their breakfast. These people need a course in How To Treat Hotel Guests. We do not recommend this hotel to anyone and we will never stay there again.",May 2018,Plaza Prague Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d276512-Reviews-Plaza_Prague_Hotel-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,1.0,4.0

Very Nice Place to Stay in Ireland,"February, 2016 we took a guided tour of Ireland. The 1st hotel we stayed in was the Newpark Hotel in Kilkenny. The room was very nice with a view of the gardens through large to floor windows. The bathroom was state of the art. The room, bath and whole hotel was decorated well. Large lobby with a fireplace. The staff were very friendly and could not help you enough. The breakfast buffet was everything that you would want. Diningroom service was very good and tables had white tablecloths. I don't know if there is a charge for breakfast because it was included in our tour. I recommend this hotel to everyone. Only one night stay but would go back for a longer time. We did not get to see the town because it was dark when we took the short walk to dinner. There is a shopping mall in town. Very enjoyable one night stay.

Not nice,We stayed here on the way back from a cruise. The hotel website said there were outlets near by. This is the main reason we booked this hotel. When checking in the desk clerk said the outlets had been closed for 20 yrs. Reading the room booklet also advertised outlets near. Desk clerk said that book was new. There is nothing to do or see in this town. Couple fast food places and a Cracker Barrel. The bathroom door in our room opened into the room and in front of the room door. Door was on a spring so you could not keep it open. Desk clerk said to put the ottoman in door way to hold open. When bathroom door was open you could not get into the room from the hallway. The whole hotel inside and out was painted sickly beige and drab brown. Depressing looking. The hotel was old. Breakfast average. Would NEVER stay again.Toilet when flushed sounded like a Industrial waste management plant. It was so loud. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

Never Again,We stayed here 1 night on our way to board a cruise ship. Have never been there before and will never again. There are no towel racks in the bathrooms so we used the pinch hangers in the closet. Desk clerk said none of the rooms have them.

It was kind of fun to see the planes up close. The room was average. Our air conditioner broke twice and was fixed. They have gated parking for those who want to leave their cars there while traveling. I believe there is a charge for this. The bathroom sink was outside of the room that housed the toilet and tub. The sink was not user friendly due to having almost no space to put your things. Our toilet seat was falling off but the maintenance man was gone for the night. So i fixed it myself.

Outlets near Interstate 95,"The Carolina Outlets are near Interstate 95, many hotels and restaurants in Smithfield, NC. The outlets have many stores with a range of prices I believe for everyone. If you shop outlets you should know what the price is at your home stores to know if you are getting a good deal at the outlets or at home stores. In my opinion outlets do not have the great discount prices they used to. So you should be a wise shopper. Yes, there are many good buys and sometimes there are additional discounts taken off ""The Outlet Prices"".

The desk clerk was a very friendly lady. The room was very nice. We had breakfast there the next morning...which was very good. It is a buffet. You can pick out your main dish (eggs, pancakes,french toast etc and will be fixed hot for you. The desk clerk in the morning was also a nice person. The staff are friendly and willing to help you in any way they can. We liked the hotel and the staff so much that we have booked 2 more stays there for an upcoming trip. Free shuttle to and from the airport and parking. I forgot to mention that the hotel also offers lunch and dinner for a fee. The hotel was very clean and we would recommend it to everyone.",December 2014,Hilton Garden Inn Dulles North,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g30246-d1163341-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Dulles_North-Ashburn_Loudoun_County_Virginia.html,"Ashburn, Virginia",hotels,5.0,4.0
Won't Stay Again,"We stayed here on our way to Florida for a cruise. The staff was friendly, the location was good (near Interstate 95). The room was terrible....the carpet needed to be replaced...was dirty...would not walk on it without shoes on. There were stains every where on the carpet and a BIG water stain in the corner of the carpet where something had leaked. This was the 2nd Days Inn we stayed in on our way to Florida. We had never stayed at a Days Inn before and will never stay again!!!",November 2014,Days Inn & Suites by Wyndham Savannah North I-95,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35195-d622778-Reviews-Days_Inn_Suites_by_Wyndham_Savannah_North_I_95-Port_Wentworth_Georgia.html,"Port Wentworth, Georgia",hotels,1.0,4.0
Good Place To Stay,"My husband and I have stayed at the Sleep Inn and Suites Smithfield 8 times now. Our last visit was December, 2013. We will revisit there again in February. The hotel has a good location. Near eating places and the Carolina Outlets. This Sleep Inn has always been very clean and the staff are friendly and will help you in any way they can. Renovations have just been completed. While we were there the lobby was getting a new floor. We can't wait to get back and see nice it will look. The beds are comfortable and the breakfast area has a good selection of foods. We would recommend this hotel to everyone. Two different times friends were with us and they felt the same way we do. Sleep Inn needs to up date the pictures of the rooms on their web site. I guess they are waiting for the lobby flooring to be completed. The new renovations are very attractive.
