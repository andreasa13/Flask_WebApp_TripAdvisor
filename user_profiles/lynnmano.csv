Nothing much to see,We went to the Butterfly Park which is located within the same area to Poring Hot Spring. It was just a small area and nothing much to see. It looks like it is not well maintained. Not many butterflies can be found. Even if you don’t visit the place you will not lose much.

Nice and simple hotel,"Room is simply furnished. It’s clean. Comfortable bed. Check-in was fast. There is coffee and tea making facilities, a hair dryer. The room does not have a good soundproof.

Good Experience,We had to walk about 550m before we reached the first canopy walk station. It was quite a challenge to climb up the trail especially for some of us who have knee problem. The canopy walk was a good experience for us to overcome our fear of heights. There were 5 parts of the canopy walk with different length. The last walk was the longest. The view was amazing with many tall trees.,September 2020,Poring Treetop Canopy Walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298307-d3207861-Reviews-Poring_Treetop_Canopy_Walk-Kota_Kinabalu_Kota_Kinabalu_District_West_Coast_Divisi.html,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",attractions,5.0,4.0

Disappointed with Manager of the Day on 18/9/20,"We checked in twice at this hotel. During our first time checked in, we were given a nice & good smelling room. It was room 910 located on the 9th floor. Room was beautiful, carpeted & clean. We checked out the next day since we put a night at a hotel in Kundasang. Upon return from Kundasang, we checked in again at Hyatt. This time we were given room 1018 on the 10th floor. We were disappointed with the room given to us since it was smaller than our earlier room despite the same price paid, smell bad (old wood), looks rundown with no carpet. We complained to the reception and asked for a room change. The manager in charge of the day promised to call us once he identified a room for us. We patiently waited for his call for almost 45 minutes but he did not call us. Hence, we decided to call the reception to ask the status of our request. From his voice, it was clear that he could have forgotten about our request. We were really disappointed with the service of the manager. We were later given another room ie room 1112. This time the room was almost similar to our room 910 but without carpet. You can expect many different layout/design of room in Hyatt. Apart from the room design, the room is clean, have all the necessary facilities required like iron, hairdryer, bathrobe, slipper, safe box, fridge, tv, coffee tea making facilities. Staff at the dining area offered excellent service. Just don’t ask for room 1018.",September 2020,Hyatt Regency Kinabalu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298307-d305925-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Kinabalu-Kota_Kinabalu_Kota_Kinabalu_District_West_Coast_Division_Sabah.html,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",hotels,4.0,4.0

Excellent Service!!!,"We booked few tours from this company. We booked the 2D1N tour to Kinabalu Park and Canopy Walk and Snorkeling from the boat. Our tour guide Luq was very kind and understanding. She made our tours a memorable one. She always make sure that we are comfortable and follow our own pace. The climb to the canopy walk was a challenge to most of us since we have problems with our knee and feet. There were times we almost gave up from climbing the trail to the canopy walk, but Luq was always giving us words of encouragement. She would wait and make sure that everyone reached the other side of the canopy walk safely. We were lucky to have Luq as our tourguide. Our driver Eddie was also very careful when driving ensuring our safety. He didn’t rush to reach the respective destinations. We felt comfortable and safe with his driving. I strongly recommend to use the service of Amazing Borneo Tours if you want to have a memorable holiday in Sabah. They have excellent tour guide and staff. Customer satisfaction is their priority.

The old city of Chiang Mai wasn’t that big, so a half day tour would be sufficient to cover some places of interest. Our tour guide arrived early at the hotel. First stop was the silver temple. Built by the silversmith living in the village. It’s beautiful. We went to few small temples before we stopped at the market. Nothing interesting to look at in the market since most of the vegetables or fruits sold in the market were the same like what we have in our country.

Iron & iron board is based on request. Bathroom comes with shower and round bathtub. Air-cond works well. The only thing I don’t like about the room is it’s bed and pillow. The bed is a little hard, whilst the pillow was not comfortable. I had neck pain the following day. The breakfast was good. It has quite a good selection of food. There are also some local dish. The hotel has good ambience. In the evening, the staff will burn the mosquito coil. There are many restaurants and cafes nearby. There are no halal restaurants near the hotel. Most of the halal restaurants are located near the night market area. Opposite the hotel is a 7-eleven shop. Just a few steps away is a laundry shop. It’s also not far from the night market. If you are lazy to walk, you can take the tuk-tuk which cost about THB80 after bargain. Otherwise, they will ask for THB100.

Good experience,"Booked a private mangrove tour. It was a 2 hour tour. We boarded our boat at the Tanjung Rhu jetty. Along the river, we stopped at few places. We stopped at the eagle area to watch the eagles. Next, we stopped to look at some monkeys. Be careful with your belongings as some of the monkeys can be quite aggressive. One of the monkeys got into our boat and took away my daughter’s bottle of water. The view along the river is beautiful. We also stopped at the crocodile cave, bat cave and fish farm. Be careful when walking inside the bat cave. Some areas the ceiling is really low and you need to crawl or bend down to go to the other side. We did not enter another bat cave since it was close for renovation. We stopped at the fish farm to look at how some fish are reared and had our lunch there. There were boys who gave some information about the fish reared at the farm. It was informative and interesting. The food served was delicious and tasty. Fish tasted really fresh. After lunch, we headed back to the shore. We went back through Andaman Sea. Wow... the view is really beautiful.

Room was clean during check-in, but housekeeping did not do a good job on the following days (we stayed for 3 nights). There were lots of hairs on the floor like the room was not swept. The body wash gel was not replenished. Bed was comfortable but not the pillows. The floor in the shower area can be slippery when wet, so please be careful when using the shower.

Visited 2 monasteries out of 13 monasteries which are still in use. It’s amazing to see how the monasteries were built on the hilltop. Though the group visited 2 monasteries but I went in to visit only 1 monastery which is home for the nuns. In order to enter the monastery, you need to wear decent clothing. For the ladies, please don’t wear tight clothing or shorts. The ladies are required to wear long skirt. Since, I don’t have long skirt, hence, I wrapped myself with my pashmina . Some put on their skirt on top of their jeans . I didn’t visit the other monastery since we had to climb many steps to go up the monastery. Those with knee problems are not advisable to go up the monastery. Hence, I just waited for my group at the ground floor. The scenery around the monasteries were beautiful. I can imagine that the view would be more beautiful during sunset. We left for Athens in the afternoon. The journey to Athens took us about 5 hours. Indeed it was a long and tiring journey. However, it was manageable since the driver stopped after 2 hours into the journey for toilet and coffee breaks. We enjoyed our visit to Kalambaka for its beautiful scenery.",October 2019,Meteora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1070999-d523805-Reviews-Meteora-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",attractions,3.0,5.0
Clean & Comfortable Plane,"Booked the flight since there was a promotion on flight ticket. Price was reasonably cheap compare to other budget flights like AirAsia and Firefly. Online booking was easy, so does the online check-in. My flight was scheduled at 9.15 pm and it departed on time. The take-off and landing was excellent- bravo to the pilot. Legroom and seat was comfortable. I can stretch my legs. There was also entertainment on board although the journey was only 50 minutes. The choices of entertainment were varied- I felt entertained throughout the journey. The plane was also very clean and smelled nice. The only complaint I have is the cabin crew. The ladies don’t look attractive, no makeup, they don’t smile, always look serious, not friendly, poor customer service, when they ask you to switch off the phone, it’s like a school teacher scolded a student; not in a reminding and friendly way. Don’t feel the warmth in them. They are just very cold. Otherwise, everything about the flight and plane is very good. I would fly with Malindo again and hopefully by then they have improved on their customer service.",November 2019,Malindo Air,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729203-Reviews-Malindo-Air,World,flights,4.0,3.0
Comfortable flight,"Decided to board the flight since it offered the cheapest flight ticket. Bought the ticket many months ahead of the trip, hence, ticket was reasonably cheap. Flight did not depart on time, it was delayed. Despite the flight from Athens to Santorini was delayed we managed to arrive on time in Santorini. The pilot must have been a ‘seasoned’ person flying from Athens to Santorini. The landing was good. The seat has good legroom, I could stretch my legs comfortably. For someone with average height like me (160 cm), do not have problem with the legroom. The aircond works well, not too cold. The seat was also comfortable. The flight was smooth with only minor turbulence in the middle of the journey.",October 2019,Volotea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d10533097-Reviews-Volotea,World,flights,4.0,3.0

Prior to entering the Taj Mahal compound, we had to go through security check. Bags were checked by the security officer. It’s advisable to visit the place early in the morning since by noon the number of people visited the Taj Mahal ballooned. We arrived early in the morning, even during the time we arrived, there were already many people. From the place we were dropped off, we took the train to the Taj Mahal’s compound.

Beautiful Palace,"Visited the place towards the end of April. It was scorching hot and we brave the heat to visit the place. We opted for the jeep to go up the fort. Another option that one could consider is to ride the elephant to go up the fort. It wasn’t that far from the parking area to the fort, roughly around 10 minutes. Along the way we saw the locals selling their traditional food. The road was dusty, perhaps because it was hot and dry. However, the experience along the way up to the fort was really precious to me. I saw how tough life is in India, staying in a crowded housing area (feeling thankful, back home life is not that difficult) people selling local things or souvenirs chasing tourists begging them to buy their products which can be a nuisance to the tourists, something I don’t see happening in my country. Try to avoid those sellers, if you buy from one seller, the rest of the sellers will come and pester you to buy from them. It was an uneasy experience for us. We could not enjoy our visit in peace. We entered the fort and were amazed at how beautiful Amber Fort is. The carvings on the building was beautiful. The place was huge. In the fort there was a garden area, also an area in the middle of the fort where the ladies during the old time got together. If you need to rest and have a drink, there’s also the cafeteria. The toilet... quite clean but water was limited. Water in the tap was like trickling when I turned on the tap. We enjoyed our visit to the fort.

However, the toilet smells really bad like a sewerage system. We were told that it was an old hotel and was renovated. I guess that was the reason why the toilet smells bad. The wifi in our room didn’t work well. Signal was really weak. Food selection at the hotel was good. There were varieties of food to choose for breakfast and dinner. Mostly Indian specialty which was tasty. I love the tea masala. It’s a spicy tea. During dinner we were entertained with local traditional dance. Service by the hotel was excellent.

Snow Activities,"To go up to the snow activities area, we had to take the cable car. There were activities like ski, snow mobile and sledge. For those who just want to laze around, there were quite a number of shops where one can sit down for coffee and food. The price for the activities is not fixed, one can bargain the price. But be careful with the boys who operated the snow mobile. They would stop at a certain spot and ask for tips and compare the amount with their friends. In the beginning when we negotiated the price, we had the impression that the price covered everything. Never expected that they would stop at a certain spot to ask for tips. Anyway, from our experience, in India everything is about tips. It’s not an uncommon scene for people to ask for tips.
