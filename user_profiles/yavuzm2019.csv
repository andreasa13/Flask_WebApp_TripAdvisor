Very crowded,"This was my third visit to Acropolis. But, this time unfortunately encountered the holiday of OHI feast and the weather was very warm. Although the entrance was free of charge, there was a long queue at the entrance. The young members of our family stayed there for entrance. I and my wife wanted to use the elevator for elderly people and disables. The attendant told us that we have to walk about 200 meters uphill outside. After climbing about 500 meters, someone on the road told us that we have to walk another 500 meters! That was nonsense! Then, we decided to get back and rest in a tavern on the way. As the attendants also informed us, a wide elevator was under construction to solve this nonconformity.
