Great Fun,"Learning to throw hatchets was great fun! Cory is engaging and helpful, and by the time we left we even threw an actual, full-sized axe, which was great. We expected an hour to be too long, but we actually went over the limit by accident. Luckily nobody minded. Both my wife and I had a blast. We would definitely go back to Lumberjaxe!",November 2020,LumberJaxe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29209-d17853972-Reviews-LumberJaxe-Athens_Georgia.html,"Athens, Georgia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Homemade pasta! Good prices!,"Homemade pasta! Our friends took us here and we loved it! The lady who runs the place makes everything from scratch, and when it’s gone, it’s gone, so it’s best to arrive early. The spinach ravioli with normale sauce (tomato) is to die for. Our bellies were full for the equivalent of about $3 a plate.",January 2020,Spaghetteria Luli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g318866-d14999785-Reviews-Spaghetteria_Luli-Durres_Durres_County.html,"Durres, Albania",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Tasty Albanian Food,"We enjoyed the very personable waiter. He was happy to recommend vegetarian options for us. Be attentive when he tells you the daily specials, because there are about 20! This was traditional Albanian food at prices that seemed reasonable to us.

Must Visit,"This place is a must see! What else is there to say? Go visit! We spent a few hours wandering around and learning about the amazing history here.

Tasty and Affordable,"Good service, nice prices, and tasty pizza! Each pizza is served in large slices (then cut into three smaller pieces), and there are interesting toppings to choose from such as salmon and apple. We met a Greek couple who live nearby.

Freshly Made and Tasty,"We had a vegetable baked potato and a veggie breakfast, plus a cappuccino and egg tarts. The food was clearly fresh and good quality.

Relaxing Area,"My wife and I go to OCT Loft both with and without our kids along, since it’s not far from our home. It’s a neat little area to walk through. Compared with much of Shenzhen, it’s lower key and fairly quiet. The restaurants tend to be good, and the atmosphere is nice in general, with a good bit of greenery and tasteful lighting (albeit a tad under illuminated at night). It’s worth visiting if you’re seeking a calmer side of the city.",June 2018,OCT Loft Creative Culture Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297415-d7371131-Reviews-OCT_Loft_Creative_Culture_Park-Shenzhen_Guangdong.html,"Shenzhen, China",attractions,4.0,4.5
Spend a Couple Hours Minimum,"At first I thought this would only take a half hour to get the gist of, but we ended up watching the changing of the guard, strolling around the pond, and also seeing the throne room, which was all nice. Then we moved through the historic village on the premises and really liked that. We didn’t go inside the cultural center or the gallery on the grounds. We ended up spending two hours, and could have stayed longer. Well worth the entry fee of around $3.",October 2018,Gyeongbokgung Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294197-d324888-Reviews-Gyeongbokgung_Palace-Seoul.html,"Seoul, South Korea",attractions,5.0,4.5

"Pleasant, Clean, Crowded","We wandered around OCT Bay more or less aimlessly. There is a water show with fountains and such that you could pay to enter, but we skipped it. The area is basically a fancy dining and shopping zone, but it's pretty, and for the most part well-maintained (rotten, broken boards in the boardwalk outside Starbucks notwithstanding). There is some neat architecture, including a funky UFO shaped building, and the tidy little alley ways and bridges are nice. This makes for a pleasant place to stroll, maybe stopping for a fruit juice here or there, getting a bite to eat, or just perusing some of the shops. There is an IMAX theater, too, so there's plenty to do. Good place for a date.",November 2017,OCT HARBOUR,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297415-d8113653-Reviews-OCT_HARBOUR-Shenzhen_Guangdong.html,"Shenzhen, China",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great Park,"Lianhuashan Park is really nice. There is a topiary display near the main entrance which our kids thought was cool, and there is a lake which has paddle boats for rent, too. Of course there is a lot of open green space. As is the case with anywhere in big city China, there are also tons of people, which can be a bit annoying. There's a hill to climb with a buddha statue on the top and nice views, and the park is just a short walk to the civic center, which is scenic in itself. Great for a picnic, relaxation, or whatever else you'd normally do in a park.",January 2018,Shenzhen Lianhuashan Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297415-d2051282-Reviews-Shenzhen_Lianhuashan_Park-Shenzhen_Guangdong.html,"Shenzhen, China",attractions,5.0,4.5
Reasonably interesting,"As is the case with other tours like this, it's a good way to get acquainted with the major points of interest. There's an English option on the headset, so everything was understandable.

Pretty Ordinary,"The room was clean and the bathroom pretty nice, but there was a bit of discoloration in the paint here and there (slight water damage?), some exposed wiring hanging from the ceiling, and generally quite a lot of noise from outside and the hallway.

The electricity always worked (except for when it flickered off for a second from time to time), the wifi was convenient (if a bit slow, but why complain about that?), and 3 of 4 mornings we had hot water.

Staff was friendly and very helpful when it came to booking excursions, giving advice, and so forth. They were also good with kids.

The breakfast was decent, and the view from the rooftop was good.",April 2015,Avataar Kathmandu Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293890-d7104800-Reviews-Avataar_Kathmandu_Hotel-Kathmandu_Kathmandu_Valley_Bagmati_Zone_Central_Region.html,"Kathmandu, Nepal",hotels,3.0,4.5

Nice Respite from Chaos,"Pay 200 rupees each, get a single-entry ticket for as long as you like, and escape the chaos outside the garden walls. The Garden of Dreams is peaceful, relaxing, and has a restaurant or two on the grounds. A relaxed stroll around the place probably takes 40 minutes or so.

Great Experience,"First, the so-called Monkey Temple where, I was told the monkeys are sacred, has lots of monkeys running around and that's pretty neat. Second, the views from the hilltop over surrounding Kathmandu are good. Third, the Temple itself is fascinating, with its proliferation of prayer wheels and flags, stupas, and interesting customs.

Pricey but Fun,"At around 120 AED for a 15 minute session, it's not cheap to go ripping around the race track. But it's worth it--the go karts are the sort used for competitive racing, and they're great fun. If you can afford to go often, it's a great way to learn your way around a race track--proper racing lines, etc.",December 2014,AL AIN RACEWAY INTERNATIONAL KART CIRCUIT,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298061-d6223411-Reviews-AL_AIN_RACEWAY_INTERNATIONAL_KART_CIRCUIT-Al_Ain_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice Enough,"A trip to the zoo is affordable, at 20 dirhams per adult, and a nice way to spend an afternoon. There are falcon shows and such. I'd say it's a pretty average zoo, but the price of admission is low. Food is also available quite cheaply at the restaurant inside.

"Drive Up, Drive Down","It's neat to drive the winding, German-built road that spans from the Green Mubazzarah up to the top of the 1,200 meter-high mountain, but ultimately the views tend to be restricted by visibility that's often low, and when it's clear, there isn't actually all that much to see from the top anyway. Desert is pretty boring to look at. It's well worth exploring once, or even twice, but that's about it. So if you're debating, go for it. If you don't expect something mind-blowing, you'll enjoy yourself. Stop along the way at the various overlooks and take your time.",January 2015,Jebel Hafeet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298061-d1453101-Reviews-Jebel_Hafeet-Al_Ain_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates",attractions,3.0,4.5
Really Nice,"We had a regular room and found it clean and comfortable. The air conditioning worked well, the satellite TV had several English channels to choose from, and the bed was comfortable and large. The free WiFi worked well in the dining area.

The grounds are well kept, which make all the difference in whether or not a hotel in the area has a good beach or not. This one does. In terms of the facility itself, the place isn't beautiful, but neither is it unappealing.

The dining options are limited to one restaurant, but it offers a choice of menu and buffet options, and we always found the food tasty and satisfying.

As for the gym, it's tiny and not well-appointed, but it at least offered me a way to keep in shape a little bit.

Each staff member we interacted with was pleasant and helpful. I'd recommend Pigeon Island Beach Resort.",July 2013,Pigeon Island Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2424710-d1830094-Reviews-Pigeon_Island_Resort-Nilaveli_Eastern_Province.html,"Nilaveli, Sri Lanka",hotels,4.0,3.5
A Bit Crowded,"Snorkeling at Pigeon Island was wonderful. I had to be careful of the many small jellyfish, but there was a splendid array of colorful fish and coral.

I got quite seriously sunburned, though, and I'd recommend that anyone wear much more sunscreen than seems necessary.

One slight downside is that this island is a major tourist attraction, and there quite a lot of people crowded onto it.",July 2013,Pigeon Island National Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2424710-d3393891-Reviews-Pigeon_Island_National_Park-Nilaveli_Eastern_Province.html,"Nilaveli, Sri Lanka",attractions,4.0,4.0
Good Take Away,"The restaurant doesn't have a great atmosphere, in terms of a pleasant ambience, but we just got take away anyhow.

The cheese kottu was really good. If you try one unique dish to Sri Lanka, kottu should be it. I've never had anything else like it, and it's fun to watch the cook prepare it for you inside his little kitchen compartment by the street.

The locals recommend this place, and they know what they're talking about.",July 2013,Kandyan Muslim Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g304138-d2703089-Reviews-Kandyan_Muslim_Hotel-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Gorgeous,"What a place to enjoy a few hours of meandering among beautiful flora and fauna (we saw giant fruit bats, monkeys, and a water monitor). The park was a bit of a respite from the noise and dinginess of Kandy. We had lunch at the restaurant near the fig tree, and found the food to be good, if not great.",July 2013,Royal Botanical Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1194819-d523519-Reviews-Royal_Botanical_Gardens-Peradeniya_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html,"Peradeniya, Sri Lanka",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worthwhile,"The temple is worth a visit. We saw it after visiting three other temples in one day. Avoid the services of a guide, however, as the one we had was bored and matter-of-fact, as well as none too interesting, and he insisted on a ""tip"" afterward, the price of which he named.

Oh, and we were told that if we were carrying a backpack, we'd have to check it (we weren't), and that's supposed to be expensive.",July 2013,Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304138-d317476-Reviews-Temple_of_the_Sacred_Tooth_Relic-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",attractions,3.0,4.0
Kind of Interesting,"I enjoyed the tour of this now-defunct manufacturing facility, even if it wasn't anything amazing. It gives you an idea how things worked and how tea is made, which I didn't know much about prior to our visit. More interesting, though, is a drive along the road outside to explore the tea plantation itself and see pickers in action.",July 2013,Ceylon Tea Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304138-d3136530-Reviews-Ceylon_Tea_Museum-Kandy_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",attractions,3.0,4.0
Lovely Stay,"Suzy and Bhatiya were excellent hosts who went out of their way to ensure that we had a pleasant stay in their bed and breakfast. They helped us make arrangements to travel and sightsee, and offered much useful advice along the way, as well as making us very comfortable in their lodging.

While the Manor is victim to the same humidity that afflicts buildings everywhere in the area (there was no air conditioning, and our room was a bit musty and damp), we soon adjusted and the rooms and property are well-kept and clean. Suzy is an amazing cook, too, so spend a little extra money and get a meal or two. She mostly uses produce from her own garden (including rice).

We thoroughly enjoyed evenings out on the porch drinking tea, relaxing, and socializing. Wifi is free and usually worked well (but the internet itself didn't always work, much like the electricity, which was out once for a while, due to a tree falling on a line somewhere).

Even though the Manor is a bit outside of Kandy, the seclusion has its own charm, and it's a pretty remarkable experience to be practically in the jungle.",July 2013,The Kandyan Manor- Home Stay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g8557471-d1995037-Reviews-The_Kandyan_Manor_Home_Stay-Katugastota_Kandy_District_Central_Province.html,"Katugastota, Sri Lanka",hotels,4.0,4.5

Classy,"The Beach Rotana doesn't occupy a particularly beautiful property, although its little stretch of beach isn't bad in itself. It does offer classy surroundings, helpful and friendly staff, the most splendid breakfast buffet I've ever experienced, and it's connected to a shopping mall, too, meaning you can get your fill of what Abu Dhabi has to offer quite easily.

A value winner.,"The Hilton has dated rooms, but they are clean and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The grounds are nice. The location, next to an unfinished mall, is pretty good, being rather central to other things like the beach and corniche. What really makes this place a food value, though, is the free shuttle to the Hilton Resort.

Lots of Food for the Money,"If you like Arabian food, Al Mallah is a good bet. The food is cheap and the quality is good. It's up to par with traditional food in the area. They have good hummus and falafel. Four of us ate for 65 AED and we had leftovers. The service is not the typical fawning-all-over-you type of the pricier Western establishments, but the waiters are happy to help after you get their attention.",February 2013,Al Mallah Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298061-d2734458-Reviews-Al_Mallah_Restaurant-Al_Ain_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Mild Curries,"Indian Curry offers a good value in the malls, but the standalone location near the Golf Club has a nicer atmosphere and seems to offer better quality food. This is a great place to take friends in the evening and sit outside in the park. The service is good and there is an array of tasty choices available. The butter naan is good, as is the cauliflower. If you don't like your Indian food too spicy, skip the rice and go for a mild curry.",January 2013,Indian Curry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298061-d3918056-Reviews-Indian_Curry-Al_Ain_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,4.0,4.0
