modern & eye catching,"I believe this is a good example of how modern museum should look like. It's quite big, huge windows inside (hence the ambience is bright), exhibits well laid out on few floors.",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
a must & the face of the past,"The less said the better, hence it's a must if you're in Athens. It's best to appear very early with tickets bought already online (best choice is to buy combined tickets, 30 eur each, on their official page tap.gr -- they allow the entrance to the Acropolis itself and other archaeological sites, like Hadrian's library).",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
modern & nicely located,"I warmly advise to stay there if you look for a well kept apartment in Athens. It's very modern, comfortable beds, cleaned daily - and Despina, the manager, is really helpful and eager to arrange anything you'd need (i.e. a transfer from Venizelos airport - it's paid with cash directly to a driver, costs 35 euro, which is less than a taxi taken from the airport to the center).",October 2019,Athina Street Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15324836-Reviews-Athina_Street_Apartments-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Nice and calm,"Looking for an average, calm place in the southern Crete, Kakkos Bay will be a good choice. The hotel itself is quite pretty, not too fancy, but modern in comparison to many other Greek hotels, the designer(s) mixed Cretan style with a pinch of modern one in a pleasant way.

The staff is polite, helpful and speaks fluent English (and also German). We were surprised, though, once it turned out there is a daily climate tax you ought to pay (3 EUR per room & day -- not much, but still surprising).

The ambience is really lovely. The well kept garden, very nice beach (the sunbeds and umbrellas completely free).

Do not expect any night life or so called 'animations' -- it is not this kind of place, even though it offers all inclusive etc. And thanks god! ;)

There was rather poor variety of food, but we couldn't complain on the days we actually ate in a hotel's restaurant. All was fresh and tasty.

I will consider coming back to this hotel for sure.",September 2018,Kakkos Bay Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1188753-d662764-Reviews-Kakkos_Bay_Hotel-Ferma_Ierapetra_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Something different,"Such a great place! If you are fed up with all the 'Greek souvenirs' that were actually produced in China, have a look at Zalo. It will be easy -- going out of The Archaeological Museum just look right, have 1 minute long walk and here it is, the nicest small souvenir shop in Irakleio.

All the things you will be able to find there are something different. More classy, chosen with taste, and just pretty. Yes, they are not cheap, as these items are made in Greece, but it is worth it. Find out yourself :).",September 2018,Zalo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189417-d10332532-Reviews-Zalo-Heraklion_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Perfect calmness,"If you do look for less crowded places, not so noisy, without loud music... go to the south easter Crete. This specific beach will offer you its best - the wall made of white clay you can use for the skin to beautify it; turquoise and clean water; clean sand, no dirt, some underwater rocks and sealife to observe while diving.

The place, when you drive from Ierapetra, is not so easily accessible - you have to drive up and down the plateau, but first, it is worth it, and second, the road is in good condition and the views are... stunning.

The beach is nudists friendly.",September 2018,Agrilos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1526211-d12728113-Reviews-Agrilos_Beach-Xerocambos_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Siga siga...,"On our way back from Itanos we wanted to eat something and decided to give this lovely, rustic place a chance. I have mixed feelings. Surely the ambience is calm and perfect to have a rest. The food was ok - not an outstanding one, not bad either. But! We waited for the waiter (the owner?) too long; then, we waited for the bill also too long... waited and waited. The owner apparently was more interested in chatting with his folks at the table located close to the toilets. I know that Crete is an island and life is a bit slower here, it is ok. On the other hand, when you run a restaurant or a tavern, it is good idea to pay attention to guests...",September 2018,Metohi Vai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2161232-d2707116-Reviews-Metohi_Vai-Vai_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Buy the tickets online and let the cathedral possess you,"The cathedral itself is just a stunning place. Worth your time, especially if you happen to be an architecture lover. I would say it is a must see in Seville.

But! Leave the idea of buying tickets offline, at the cathedral, otherwise you will wait in neverending queue... Buy the tickets online (you are expected to have them printed) and enjoy this magnificent building without waiting :).",May 2018,Catedral de Sevilla,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187443-d191137-Reviews-Catedral_de_Sevilla-Seville_Province_of_Seville_Andalucia.html,"Seville, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5
Is it a garbage of the island?,"The place itself is lovely. It could be Rhodes' kind of Cretan Elafonisi or Balos, almost. Two seas meet each other there, the ambience is beautiful, but... tons of garbage are also present there :(. It was heartbreaking to see it - and disgusting to walk on the sand barefoot.

It is a long drive from the north of the island, but we spent over there only one hour due to this dirt.

As a place for kitesurfers it is probably good one, for it is windy and spacious.",August 2017,Prasonisi Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2268307-d2242042-Reviews-Prasonisi_Beach-Kattavia_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
off the beaten track,"Whenever I talk to a person that also visited Rhodes once or twice (or at all), I learn that he or she didn't visit Kamiros nor heard of it. It makes me a bit sad that such places, located maybe a bit more off the beaten 'tourist' track, are often ignored. On the other hand, maybe it's not this bad?

I recommend to see the ruins of ancient city of Kamiros warmly. We reached the place by the end of the day -- it was not this hot anymore, the sun was slowly preparing to hide, and we were lucky to be the only visitors there. You won't find anything this fancy over there, it's not Athens' Acropolis, but still - any ancient world lover should visit Kamiros. Just to enjoy the place itself and its calmness & long gone majesty.

There's a small place to sit and drink a coffee too, if needed.",August 2017,Ancient Kamiros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g8294925-d254500-Reviews-Ancient_Kamiros-Kalavarda_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"stop by, if you do love Greek cuisines","Choose this tavern if you adore Greek traditional cuisine. You must not allow yourself to be misled by the locations of Molos, for it's located just by the road - it is worth your visit.

Nice staff, delicious food, what else should be said?
(Ok, the neighbourhood of the road is not pleasant, but it's the only downside -- replaced easily with the sea view!).

We visited Molos many times, wandering around the island and relaxing on nearby Glystra beach.",August 2017,Taverna Molos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g776010-d10358649-Reviews-Taverna_Molos-Lardos_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Big, pretty noisy","I didn't feel this well, staying at this hotel - but I must confess it was my fault. This is a huge one, I would say typical Greek hotel focusing on all inclusive service. It definitely needs some renovation, but I cannot say something was wrong. The staff was kind, the room cleaned every day; we also rented a car at the hotel for the whole stay (and they gave us a really good price).

The beach by the hotel is nice too, if you do not mind that it is going to be crowded and loud.

The hotel itself is located in a 'suburban' area of Faliraki, so it takes some time to get to the center of the town.",August 2017,Pegasos Deluxe Beach Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635612-d1900124-Reviews-Pegasos_Deluxe_Beach_Hotel-Faliraki_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Simple, but so good!","We visited Avgoustis many times. The very first impression, when you will get there, may be just so-so - it is not a fancy place. I think they do not care for this, and for a good reason. What they do care about is delicious food. Wide variety of Greek dishes, seafood of course, nice desserts, calm and rather small place by the sea with a great view... if you look for it, Avgoustis will won your heart. And the staff is always very kind.",August 2017,Avgoustis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g775851-d4290771-Reviews-Avgoustis-Tsilivi_Planos_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Small, but pretty and calm place","We were just wandering around the island and saw this adorable place just passing by in the car. If you do look for not so big and rather calm beach, Glystra is worth it! Every day we decided to devote to this blissful area was more than nice -- the beach itself is very clean and kept tidy by the staff; it's also a good place for those ones that are into diving or snorkeling (and the underwater life is, I'd say, a rich one).
I warmly advice to visit this beach, if you want some laziness and, more or less, silence (no loud, irritating radio music!). There's good tavern within in the neighbourhood too, called Molos. It's worth to stop by there for something tasty as well -- there is surely wide variety of Greek specialties.",August 2017,Glystra Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g227884-d3506571-Reviews-Glystra_Beach-Lindos_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
