As well as the beef and chicken shawarma plates with a small fattoush salad for my parents. We all enjoyed our meals very much. They serve large portions and the items are decently priced. I typically don’t order chicken shawarma because of the taste, but the shawarma they serve here tastes very good, clean and fresh compared to the other places you buy shawarma from.

Good Food for Take Out,"I have ordered twice from here, both times I ordered the dinner wrap combo which comes with a gyro on a pita, fries, salad and pop. The first time I order with the chicken(gyro style with cut up meat) and the second time I ordered with the chicken souvlaki on a stick. I preferred it better with the souvlaki and I found it tasted better. The fries they have are very good as they add a hint of spice to the fries. Salad was good, but could use more flavour in the dressing. My husband also ordered the gyro(beef) dinner which came with rice, potatoes and salad. He enjoyed his meal as well.

Very Good Food,"I had made a reservation for a group of 6 (3 couples). The establishment interior is smaller compared to typical restaurants. To start we ordered the calamari and breaded shrimp, both tasted average.

For the main course we ordered the steak Josephine, filet mignon, Cuban lobster, surf and turf, and peppercorn chicken. Our meals also came with a salad, potatoes and greens. The sides you receive are very huge portions (try not to fill up on appetizers for this reason). The caeser salad was very delicious! Everyone also enjoyed their main course very much.

To start I had the fried calamari, I then ordered from the Prefixe lunch menu which comes with 3 courses total (app, main course and dessert). I ordered the caesar salad, Chicken Piccata, and New York Cheesecake. Everything tasted very good. My family members ordered the Filet Mignon, Salmon and scallop risotto.

It was very tasty but a little spicy because of the piri piri sauce and jalapeño peppers. For my main course, I had the grilled Zucchini flatbread which was a vegan dish. My friends had the pasta and poutine. Overall, we enjoyed the restaurant ambience and the food. The staff working there, were very courteous.

There is seating for both the patio and indoors at the moment, during COVID. As an appetizer we ordered the calamari which tasted very good and fresh. As a main course, I ended up ordering the Margarita Pizza, and caeser salad. My other family members ordered the sushi bowl, fish and chips, boa burger and steak frites.

I ended up ordering the dry seasoning chicken fingers with caeser salad as a side. My husband ordered the Memphis sirloin which came with vegetables and a baked potato.

I ended up ordering the BBQ chicken sandwich, which came with a side of fries. I have tried this sandwich at a different location and thought, if I ordered the same at this location it would taste similar, but I was wrong, it just tasted average to me although it was made from a real chicken breast which is a plus.

Group of 12,"This was my first time axe throwing. We arrived as a group 12 people. As an introduction, we had an amazing coach named Matt. He was great at instructing the rules of the game as well as teaching each person how to properly throw an axe. I would definitely recommend a coach if it is your first time axe throwing. As a brief summary - to start, the game is 1 vs. 1 (two teams) depending on how big your party is. We had two lanes in total. Each person takes their turn throwing an axe, amongst your team. Your objective is to hit the axe, as close to a bullseye as possible to gather more points to beat the other team. The top 4 players with the most points have a face off, from there the top two players move on to the final round. Then, the top two players have a “big axe” battle for top player. Overall, I would most likely try this again although I find it could be a little on the pricey side for the total amount of time you get to play as a larger party. If more lanes were open for us, it would have been more enjoyable.",March 2020,BATL | The Backyard Axe Throwing League,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154990-d13149635-Reviews-BATL_The_Backyard_Axe_Throwing_League-Hamilton_Ontario.html,"Hamilton, Canada",attractions,4.0,5.0

My husband ordered the brisket sandwich wrapped up with a side of potatoes. After trying the potatoes and fries as sides. I would recommend the fries over the potatoes. If the potatoes had a little more flavour, I think they would have beat the fries. Overall the food tasted good and fresh. The only downside was, the location of where we were seated, was very close to the cash area where the food was being grilled.

Authentic Poutine,"I am from out of town and wanted to experience an authentic tasting poutine in Quebec. I came for lunch. Upon reviewing the menu, there is an optional sheet given to you, to fill out if you wanted to create a custom poutine with the ingredients of your choice. I ended up ordering a menu item called poutineville (without the beef). This poutine was very unique compared to other poutines I have had, because instead of fries you receive mashed potatoes with your traditional gravy and cheese of course. Their house wine gravy had a nice flavour. Overall poutine tasted good and very cheesy.",November 2019,Poutineville,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155033-d8401589-Reviews-Poutineville-Quebec_City_Quebec.html,"Quebec City, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Brunch,"Haven’t been to Golden Griddle in a few years but decided to come in for a brunch.

Home fries portion was very small, was still hungry afterwards.",October 2019,Golden Griddle Family Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154990-d4873478-Reviews-Golden_Griddle_Family_Restaurant-Hamilton_Ontario.html,"Hamilton, Canada",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Reservation for Large Group,"First time being at this location, came for lunch with my co-workers. We grabbed many share platters(appetizers). I ended up trying the hummus and calamari apps which both tasted really good. As a main, I had the rotisserie chicken which ended up being half a chicken! It came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The chicken was nicely seasoned and tasted very moist, overall the food tasted great. I most likely will return.

Party of 12,"Booked a reservation for a party of 12. All our first time eating at this establishment. We ordered a multiple of the Lebanese Cavapi, Lunch in Beirut, Before Sunset, with sides of friend cauliflower, halloumi cheese, and Persian tea as a beverage. Overall everything tasted amazing. The price per plate is expensive but worth it for the big portion amount you receive. The fried cauliflower is a must to try, very delicious. Customer service was very good, especially if the staff is aware it is your first time eating there.

They currently don’t have their liquor license but are obtaining it shortly in November. The interior is a smaller scale restaurant but our waiter mentioned they are expanding the size to a larger place next door to them (or combining the two spaces).",October 2019,Maro's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155002-d4852845-Reviews-Maro_s-Oakville_Ontario.html,"Oakville, Canada",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Dinner,"Came here with a group of four. We ordered a vegetable soup, steak dish, chicken dish and chicken pizza. Popcorn is complimentary appetizer. Overall, everyone enjoyed their meal and thought it tasted great but for myself I would give this restaurant a 3/5 because the chicken tasted average. Also, the prices are expensive.

Amazing,"I booked a guided tour in advance and I would recommend the same. Make sure to book for the by pass line summit access, which takes you to the second level as well as the top level after the tour. There are four elevators in total which fit up to about 45 people. On the second level, there is a cafe and souvenir shop. On the very top level there is a champagne bar, as well as wax figurines of the Eiffel Tower architect, Thomas Edison and another lady. Overall, the view is amazing from the second floor but on the top floor the view is even better.",October 2019,Eiffel Tower,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188151-Reviews-Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good,"Overall food tasted good. Make sure to keep your receipt if you would like to use the washroom, you have to punch in your order code to access the washroom.

3 Night stay,"A small scale hotel, surrounded by many cafes, and restaurants about 5-10mins walking distance. The main floor lobby is very modernly designed. There is an option of buffet breakfast although this wasn’t included with my stay. The room was kept very clean each day. Free Nespresso coffee was provided in your room, as well as a free bottle of water per day. Staff was very friendly and courteous. You are required to pay a small city taxes fee per night. We stayed in a superior room and standard room, I would recommend a luxury room for more space.",October 2019,Fred Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d529916-Reviews-Fred_Hotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,4.0,4.5
Avoid this place,"I ended up ordering the chicken caeser salad and my husband ordered the steak and fries. Before my meal was prepared I asked for my chicken to be well done, which the waiter mentioned the chicken is always well done. When I received my order, my chicken was very cold and not well done. It felt like the chicken was not prepared fresh but have been kept refrigerated(not sure if that’s normal in France for chicken to served cold in a salad). My husband on the other hand had no issues and enjoyed his food. The restaurant pricing is also expensive because of the location. At the end of our meal when we had to pay our waiter gave us our bill then brought a calculator to us and typed in an amount for his service taxes, and mentioned that his amount was for his tip. After we payed we felt scammed, other restaurants do not do this.",October 2019,Le Bailli de Suffren,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d2009305-Reviews-Le_Bailli_de_Suffren-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,2.0,2.0
