Excellent Hotel,"We were pleased to have selected this hotel for our stay in Barcelona. The personnel were very friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable (firm memory foam type). The bathroom was very large and had a spacious shower. A special thanks to Jessica, Raluca, Alesia, Usomane and for their extra help with recommendations, information and other assistance. The Hotel is in an excellent location for visiting Barcelona. Away f the night club noise but close enough to everything to easily get to everything on the subway. There’s a station right across the street too.",November 2019,Hotel Concordia Barcelona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d309580-Reviews-Hotel_Concordia_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.0
Very good tapas.,"Very good tapas. We stopped here before going to a Flamenco show a couple blocks away. The tapas were very good. The place plays old blues music which we thought was pretty cool too. The prices are a little bit higher than we have been able to find at other places but not too much. We had two 30 cl beers, two small bites and two shared tapas and one order of tomato bread for $30 euros. I recommend this place if you are in the area.",November 2019,Vivo Tapas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d10901576-Reviews-Vivo_Tapas-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great breakfast and lunch place,"We had breakfast here twice and dinner once. Everything we had was delicious. There’s a really good variety of choices for breakfast and enough for lunch or dinner on the menu. If you’re looking for something like an American style breakfast you will like this place. Oh yeah, and they play hits from the 70’s and 80’s from the States all the time. Service was quick and the price was reasonable. We definitely recommend this place.",November 2019,La Desayuneria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d8626726-Reviews-La_Desayuneria-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Must see,This is the one place that you must see in Barcelona if you do nothing else. Make sure and buy your tickets online ahead of time as you will not be able to walk up the day you want to and buy tickets. We are here during the off season and we had to buy our tickets for 3 days in advance. This Basilica is unlike any other you will ever see. Make sure you at least get the audio guide too. It gives you an excellent history of the development of the church and the reason for all of the different architectural features. Definitely recommend this place.,November 2019,Basilica of the Sagrada Familia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190166-Reviews-Basilica_of_the_Sagrada_Familia-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Breakfast,"We stumbled upon this place using Google Maps. It didn’t pop up at first but by zooming in we found it. We went here twice for breakfast it was so good. I had the scrambled eggs with spinach, mushrooms, cheese and bacon. It came with toast made from an awesome rustic bread. We also had their yogurt and fruit bowl. Great coffee selection and fresh squeezed orange juice.

Beautiful Fountain,"You must see this in person to see the size and details of the sculpturing. It is truly a unique fountain. If you want to see it lit up, go before sunrise.

Good Hotel to Base out of and see Rome,This hotel is very good for location near the main sites in Rome. We were able to walk to everything from here. The Vatican takes a subway ride as would some further sites but we were there to see the ancient Roman sites. The bed was reasonably comfortable. The shower was very small but functional. The room was somewhat small also but we were able to fit in it okay. The breakfast was good and the staff were all friendly. I recommend this hotel for basing a visit to Rome.,October 2019,Hotel Sonya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d232838-Reviews-Hotel_Sonya-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0
Two Nights - Budget Hotel,This hotel was convenience for location. The bed was reasonably comfortable. There’s a safe and a shower. The hotel is right next to the train tracks and within easy walking distance of the main station. Breakfast was very good. The room really needs to be redone. It was very tired. Lots of marks on the wall. We stayed for the convenience of getting to and from Pompeii and the airport. There’s a dedicated bus service at the train station that takes you to the airport. Probably would stay in or near Pompeii if we were to be going back to Pompeii.,October 2019,ibis Styles Napoli Garibaldi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187785-d248870-Reviews-Ibis_Styles_Napoli_Garibaldi-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",hotels,3.0,4.0
History all Around You,"What an incredible place. If you like history at all this is a must visit place. The Acropolis has so many different aspects of Ancient Greek life covered. I’m very big on history and the amount of information you can get from here is excellent and very interesting. I recommend that you get some type of guide for your time here so you can understand the significance of everything you are looking at. If you don’t you will miss out. We actually used a downloadable app from Rick Steve’s that has free audio guides with maps for your phone. It was really very good. Still we were nearby some of the local guides at times and we overheard bits of information about the Acropolis that I’m sure you would only get from them. In any case, get a guide for the site. Highly recommend.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
What an Incredible Find of a Hotel,"We stayed four wonderful nights in this hotel and wished we had been there longer. The place is a real gem of a find for a very good price. The room was really large and had a really comfortable king size bed, a kitchenette with a Nespresso machine, hotpot, cookware, dishes, cooktop, refrigerator and a pullout couch. The bathroom had a large walk-in shower with plenty of hot water and water pressure. Just an awesome hotel suite. What really set the hotel apart from any of the other hotels we have stayed at was the service. A special thanks to Vicky for her help with the entire setup of how things worked with the entrance, the HVAC unit, the television, breakfast options and for helping us out with setting up a couples massage in our room. She also helped us out with places to find restaurants and gave us excellent directions for getting to the Acropolis. Vicky really went out of her way to make sure that we were doing great during our stay. The hotel is easy walking distance to the Acropolis too. We definitely recommend this hotel and will be back if we are in Athens.",October 2019,NLH Fix - Neighborhood Lifestyle Hotels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d11913451-Reviews-NLH_Fix_Neighborhood_Lifestyle_Hotels-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Good Greek Food,We ate dinner at this restaurant once during our one week stay in Kamari. We only ate once at any of the restaurants in town as it was off season and we wanted to give a little business to as many people as we could. We had enough food from here to be able to take some back to our hotel and heat up for a second dinner. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. The gyro was a bit different from what you would get at a stand in the States but really good. It was a huge dinner with lots of grilled chicken. The ground lamb and beef kebabs were delicious too. I recommend this place for dinner.,October 2019,Meli & Thymari,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g658914-d4290735-Reviews-Meli_Thymari-Kamari_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fantastic all Suite Hotel,"We stayed here for 6 nights towards the end of October and we were really impressed. The suite came with a small kitchenette with a two burner cooktop, a small refrigerator, cookware and dishes. The bed was very comfortable, a really big deal to us. The living space was also comfortable. The unit had its own small hot tub with a privacy wall, it’s own patio with privacy curtains,table with chairs and loungers. We were there in the off season, 3rd week of October, and about 25% of the local businesses were closed. This is the perfect time to just relax. The beach is a 3-4 minute walk and the sun is still warm. The night clubs were closed in Kamari I think because we didn’t hear anything at night as far as club music. A great place for a relaxing time. I highly recommend this place.",October 2019,Tamarix del Mar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g658914-d276924-Reviews-Tamarix_del_Mar-Kamari_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5

A special thanks to Carmen at the front desk for her help with printing our boarding passes and other travel documents.

Walk Through History,"We did a tour on our own using the Rick Steves Audio Europe app. It was a free download and came with a PDF map. I wish I would have found it earlier in our trip. It covers a lot of places we’ve visited. The tour took us about 3 1/2 hours to do but we didn’t rush between the places. It covered a lot of the archeological site. We went to see the amphitheater too, which wasn’t a part of the audio tour.

Awesome Hotel,"This hotel is a really incredible place to stay in Vienna. Comfortable beds, beautiful decor, great breakfast and a fantastic staff. I can’t say enough good things about the staff we encountered during our stay. A special thanks to Clemens for all of his assistance and advice. And although we didn’t get the name of the woman at the desk on our second morning, a thank you to her as well for looking out for us when we encountered a shady guy just outside the entrance of the hotel. On checkout we had left a few items in our room, a pair of golf rain pants, a pair of socks and some over the counter medicine; the hotel emailed me to let me know that their cleaning staff had found them within 15 minutes of our departure.

Very Nice Family run Hotel,"Solid 3 star hotel. We stayed here for a week in early September. The hotel is nicely kept and very updated. The room had an en-suite bathroom and toilet. Everything seems like it is new. The bed was pretty comfortable. The hotel does have an elevator. The neighborhood is decent. The only negative we encountered was the staff couldn’t seem to ever get the cups, tea, coffee and sugar restocked. I had to stop by the desk and request it every night after returning from sightseeing. They also didn’t supply any creamer. I had to go to the store and purchase it. Paul at the front desk was always very pleasant and would quickly assist us with anything. There was one woman at the desk who felt she needed to tell me that sugar was not good for you the first time I asked her for coffee and sugar. I would definitely recommend staying here to family and friends.",September 2019,Hotel de Flore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d529908-Reviews-Hotel_de_Flore-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,4.0,4.5

Great food and beer,"We stopped in for lunch during the Fringe Festival. We hadn’t heard anything about the place, just looked at a menu outside and thought we would find something we wanted.

Good Food Extremely Poor Waitress,"We went in for dinner tonight, 16 September. We ordered the sausage with purée potatoes and applesauce. Not what was delivered. We received the sausage with fries and salad. We were hungry and assumed that it was a little early for dinner and they just didn’t have the other sides ready. The dinner was still good. That’s it for the positive.

The waitress that took our order did that and took payment and that was about all. She stopped by our table with a small container with mayonnaise and ketchup and said, “Oh, need mustard”. After the dinner was delivered, by a different waitress, I got our waitresses attention and asked for mustard. She went inside and came back out and ignored us. We figured out why when I got the attention of the only waiter and asked for mustard. He immediately went to get some mustard. We saw him go inside and come back out and go next door. He was obviously looking. He then went around the building and came back with a gallon ziplock bag filled with mustard packets, took that inside and came back to our table with a new container with mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard packets. This all took quite a while so instead of eating a cold sausage we went ahead and had already finished it without any mustard. We thanked him and he then took the container to another couple that were “being waited on” by our waitress. She wasn’t doing anything to get them any mustard either.
I would probably have not written up this restaurant to the extent you’re reading but our waitress brought us a bill for the original order. That dish was $3 Euros more than what they delivered. We left no additional tip.
This restaurant badly needs to bring on more staff like the waiter and dump the waitress. Yes, personal issue. This instance had just too many issues to not let everyone else know what happened.",September 2019,Rheinzeit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187371-d2319947-Reviews-Rheinzeit-Cologne_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html,"Cologne, Germany",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Nice Hotel,"We stayed here for a week during the Fringe Festival and Royal Tattoo. The hotel is very nice. It is kept very clean and maintained. The staff were all very friendly with one exception and that encounter while relatively meaningless is still in my memory. It was with a woman working in the restaurant. I never got her name. I was getting a cup of coffee and noted that almost every cup had dried food residue on it so I had to move to the 2nd tray below to find a clean cup. This person asked what I was doing and I said that the cups on the top trays were still dirty with dried on food particles. I made the comment that the dishwasher hadn’t done their job correctly. To which she replied in a very defensive tone, “it must be that the dishwasher machine must not have worked correctly and the person washing dishes was doing a good job”. I didn’t really care, I just wanted a clean cup. Still, I was a dishwasher when I was younger and it was obvious that the person washing dishes hadn’t checked the dishes and figured out that the filter needed emptying out. The only reason it sticks in my mind is that she re-stacked the dirty cups and left them for others to use.

On to other things. The housekeeper was always pleasant and did a great job. The beds, while talked about in the literature were a bit too hard for our liking. We did get a reasonably decent night sleep but woke a bit sore. They could use a 1 or 2 inch memory foam topper.",August 2019,Premier Inn Edinburgh Park (Airport) Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186525-d2545476-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Edinburgh_Park_Airport_Hotel-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5

Avoid this place,"This review is for the location inside of the food court in the Honolulu terminal building. We stopped in for lunch right at changeover from breakfast to lunch. Every tray was full.... of cold food. I couldn’t believe it. They just shut down breakfast 13 minutes before I got to the counter (10:13). Everything should have been hot on the steam table. We ordered the orange chicken, broccoli beef and chow main. Everything was cold. I don’t mean cool, it was actually cold. On top of the health risk from serving food way below the temperature needed for food safety, the flavor was not that good. I don’t know what these would taste like hot but they were not good cold. I actually have never said this but, I recommend you go to the Burger King.",September 2018,Chow Mein Express,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60982-d5603616-Reviews-Chow_Mein_Express-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",restaurants,1.0,3.0
Above Average Hotel,I spent one night in a standard king room. The room came with a refrigerator. The bed was comfortable. The shower worked good without hot and cold changes. It was relatively clean and maintained. The only real negative was that the shampoo and shower gel were in dispensers attached to the wall as was the soap at the sink. There’s a sign on the counter telling you that lotion is available upon request.

Disappointing,"While the hotel is not in terrible condition you can tell it lost some of its shine. We were ""upgraded"" to a pyramid suite. A nice size room that still had some of its better days in the 90's. The furniture was old and uncomfortable to sit on. The bed was actually good. The room was kept clean by housekeeping. The food we ate on site was prepared well. We ate at the Original Chicken Tender Company (grilled chicken cobb salad) and LA Subs (Turkey and Ham Sub) in the food court. Both very good. The sub is made from high quality meats that are sliced on the deli slicer as needed for each sandwich. We also ate twice at the Pyramid Cafe. Once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both time the meals were really good. We also ate at the Public House for dinner one night. The food was okay but was really an upscale bar kitchen.
So now the disappointing part. The hotel charges $16 a day for valet parking. They also charge for self parking. You can get those parking fees waived if you are willing to lose a lot more than that amount per day. There was no place to get a snack or drink for a reasonable price anywhere in the hotel. If you don't care for Starbucks coffee get ready to take a long walk or get in your car and get off the strip. They are also adding on a $25 a day Resort fee along with another $3.35 a day in ""Resort Fee Taxes"". It would be one thing to act like a resort and charge fees for it. But, for what, wi-fi and gym access. I won't be going back until they stop these add on fees. These are not resorts, they're casinos.

Great staff,The hotel seems to be undergoing remodeling. The lobby was under renovations when we were there. It seemed like the room had undergone some remodeling but the furniture was still pretty tired looking. The bathroom had been renovated but still needs a little attention to detail. I encountered at least six staff members and everyone went out of their way to make sure they helped me in any way they could. The bed was reasonably comfortable which is very important to me. The place was also clean. I expect that the hotel will turn out very nice when fully completed. We got in late and left early so didn't get to use any of the hotel amenities.

I will try to stay here on all future trips to the Tacoma - Puyallup area.",December 2016,Best Western Premier Plaza Hotel & Conference Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g58693-d72609-Reviews-Best_Western_Premier_Plaza_Hotel_Conference_Center-Puyallup_Washington.html,"Puyallup, Washington",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent Visit to PV During Rainy Season,"First let me say, don't let rainy season keep you away. The rain only came down during daylight hours once during our 8 night stay and then only an hour or so before sunset. Most days, no rain but stay near the Marina or further north. It looked like downtown and south of town got rain every night and some afternoons. Top item of my hotel reviews, like always, the bed. Very comfortable. You could tell the bed was a bit older but still comfortable and a great night's sleep. After multiple trips all over Mexico I can tell you that a comfortable bed can be difficult to come by but this one was a good one. Nicely furnished room with a love seat that is a sleeper and small table and two chairs, lots of space. The housekeeper did a great job on keeping things cleaned up too. Of course leaving a daily tip always helps. The balcony was a little small but big enough to sit and watch the sunset from in comfort. The bathroom was clean and well maintained with separate toilet room, There was a very large closet space for your clothing and the entry hall was wide enough to store our golf clubs with them totally out of the way. For info on dining in the hotel and the nearby Marina look up my reviews on the Champions Sports Bar, the Lobby Bar, Deli Los Mangos, La Estancia, Victor's Place - Cafe Tacuba and La Terraza Di Roma. Also, check out the review on the Venu Sunshine Spa to get more info on their incredible massages and even more incredible pricing. I will also be reviewing the Marina Vallarta golf course, the Flamingo golf course and a zip line tour.",September 2016,Marriott Puerto Vallarta Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150793-d152980-Reviews-Marriott_Puerto_Vallarta_Resort_Spa-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
Breakfast was okay,We only ate here for breakfast on our last day. This restaurant wasn't open until the last 4 days of our stay. I believe it only opened at all because there was a large influx of Mexican nationals that checked in for the Independence Day celebration on September 15th. The breakfast was okay. Nothing special. We didn't get the buffet but ordered off of the menu because we really didn't want to tempt ourselves to overeat and then get on the flights home.,September 2016,La Estancia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150793-d1033015-Reviews-La_Estancia-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Nice Sports Bar with a lot of TV's,The food here is pretty good for a sports bar but the prices are a bit higher than a lot of places in the area outside of the hotel. Only ate here a couple of times. To keep costs down we went during the week and during happy hour between 1 PM and 5 PM. It worked perfect for us when we went. We don't care to eat too late at night.,September 2016,Champions Sports Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150793-d2657288-Reviews-Champions_Sports_Bar-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Very Good Italian Food, Choice of over water dining or inside with A/C.",We only went here for dinner once during our stay. The food was very good and the portions were large enough to challenge getting finished. Service was very good and the price was high for Mexico but relatively moderate compared to the States.,September 2016,La Terrazza Di Roma,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150793-d1032572-Reviews-La_Terrazza_Di_Roma-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Pleasant walk along uncrowded walkway.,We visited the boardwalk on Independence day and had the cab drop us off about midway. Have patience I am told as most days the trip is really slow getting here. Beautiful day for the walk. You will have the usual people trying to sell you a tour or get you to go on a time share presentation but they were generally friendly and no one pushed after we told them we were not interested. We even got a free margarita coupon from one of them after telling him we didn't want to do the timeshare presentation. We walked to the Central Mercado to go through the stalls and picked up a couple of items while we were there. Since it was off season and independence day we got some really good prices. Very uncrowded day. :-),September 2016,Malecón Boardwalk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150793-d2440853-Reviews-Malecon_Boardwalk-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",attractions,4.0,4.5
Amazing! You have to go have at least one meal here.,"This place is the best find for meals during our stay. A $65 peso full breakfast that includes eggs, bacon or ham, potatoes, refried beans, toast, juice and coffee. That was right at $3.61 US when we were there. When you go in for dinner the owner, Victor, will bring over a shot of Mujeriego for everyone at the table. That is an agave based liquor that is around 60 proof. We we lucky enough to have Victor give us an entire bottle to take with us on our very first visit. His marketing along with the great food, excellent service from the staff and very reasonable prices kept us coming back. I believe we ate 3 dinners and two breakfasts here. Everything we ate was delicious. At the end of your dinner meal you are usually given a glass of a cream liquor to top off the meal. Like the title says, you have to go here at least once to try it. I am positive you will be back.",September 2016,Victor's Place Cafe Tacuba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150793-d1434779-Reviews-Victor_s_Place_Cafe_Tacuba-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice walk,Plenty of things on the boardwalk around the marina. There are some unfilled spaces but plenty with shops and restaurants. When you eat outside you can look over the boats and watch them going and coming.,September 2016,Marina Vallarta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150793-d152496-Reviews-Marina_Vallarta-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",attractions,4.0,4.5
Very nice course,This is a very nice course. Pretty well maintained but stay in the fairways. That will keep you away from the crocodiles and out of the rough both. Three holes open out to the ocean too which brings on a nice breeze. As this course is really close to the ocean you can catch a small breeze on many of the holes. It is not cheap to play though. We picked up the Hot Deals on Golf Now for $75 a person. I think normal price is $145. If it weren't for Hot Deals though we would have left our clubs at home on this trip.,September 2016,Marina Vallarta Club de Golf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150793-d558781-Reviews-Marina_Vallarta_Club_de_Golf-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",attractions,5.0,4.0
Incredible Massage,We went here twice during our stay. If we would have had enough time we would have gone again. We got an off season special of a 60 minute massage for two for $60 US. Both of our massage therapists was the best we have ever had. That is really saying something as we usually get at least one massage a month. If you like to have a massage don't miss any opportunity to go here while in PV. It is definitely worth it.,September 2016,Venus Sunshine Massage and Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150793-d1078933-Reviews-Venus_Sunshine_Massage_and_Spa-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fun zipline tour and tequila taqsting for us.,"Plenty of long lines on this tour and plenty of lines. Be aware that there is a decent amount of hiking up hill to get to the zip lines. you have to climb up to get to many of the starting points. Some are pretty substantial if you are not in moderately decent shape. IF you are then no problem and you are going to have a blast. Remember to bring some $ to tip the guides. There is a barrel that you can drop your tip in at the end so you don't have to worry about havin enough smaller bills to split it up. When you finish head in to the tequila tasting area. Tip well and taste them all at least once. If you are hot, and you likely will be, bring a towel and jump in the creek/river. The water will feel very cooling and refreshing. If you are okay with a relaxing meal in the hills, hang out for the next transport and have a meal next to the river along with a couple of margaritas.",September 2016,Los Veranos Canopy Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150793-d589635-Reviews-Los_Veranos_Canopy_Tour-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",attractions,4.0,5.0
Awesome Beach,"Coki Beach is not that large and finding a place to park can be a real challenge but it is a great beach. The sand is bright white and it gently slopes out for a ways into the ocean. The view is nice and the water is warm. Along the back of the beach there are quite a few places you can get something to eat or drink. Most of the places seemed to have people walking the beach bringing drinks to people right out on their towels and chairs. There is also rental chairs, floats, noodles and umbrellas that you can get from the vendors. Forgot sunscreen, you can get that too. Want a souvenir, they have them too. If you can't stand the smell of or don't want your kids exposed to pot, you won't want to go here. It wasn't being smoked by everyone everywhere but there were a few people smoking it while we were there. It wasn't so much as to spoil our time at the beach.",January 2016,Coki Point Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g12012628-d184550-Reviews-Coki_Point_Beach-Smith_Bay_East_End_St_Thomas_U_S_Virgin_Islands.html,St. Thomas,attractions,4.0,4.0
BBQ on the boardwalk,"They had a trailer set up on the water side of Veterans Way along the waterfront in Charlotte Amalie. We got into St. Thomas late and saw it on the way to the Bluebeards Castle. We had the chicken, rice and cole slaw. The price was really reasonable and the portions large. The two of us split the meal. The food was really good. We especially liked the rice. It was prepared in a way we had never had before. Another big plus was the price. I think it was something like $7.",January 2016,Texas Pit BBQ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147404-d2399965-Reviews-Texas_Pit_BBQ-St_Thomas_U_S_Virgin_Islands.html,St. Thomas,restaurants,4.0,4.5
Nice place to stay in Charlotte Amalie,"We spent 3 nights at Bluebeard's Castle Resort. While it isn't a four star resort, it is a very good place in a convenient location of St. Thomas. The room was pretty clean but could have used some attention to detail. The bed was comfortable which always rates high with me. There was a kitchenette area that had we been staying longer would have been very convenient. For our stay we only used it for morning coffee. The pool area was very nice but could have used a little more shade. We took advantage of the breakfast at the pool areas two out of three days. Very reasonable price and very good tasting.standard American breakfast. We also had a dinner at the open air bar just above the pool one night. Good food again.",January 2016,Bluebeards Castle Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147405-d149006-Reviews-Bluebeards_Castle_Resort-Charlotte_Amalie_St_Thomas_U_S_Virgin_Islands.html,St. Thomas,hotels,4.0,4.0
Drove up in our rental car.,Awesome views and you really can't beat their bushwacker. There are other locations around the island that sell them but none compare. We had to limit ourselves to one as you can fel the effects already. :-) The views from the deck are the other reason to go here.

Awesome appetizer,"We went in for dinner, got there during the 2 for 1 Happy Hour. Perfect timing. We then decided to have an appetizer before dinner and with our first drink. The appetizer was so good we ordered another and a second drink. We were full and that was it for dinner. The appetizer we had is called Bang Bang Shrimp. Not overly hot but very very tasty.

Interesting place to visit,The history of the locks is presented very well. The layout keeps people flowing and gets you through in a couple of hours. Watching a ship go through is something to see if you;ve never seen locks in action. It's not too exciting if you've seen them somewhere else though. Unfortunately none of the snack bar or restaurant were open.,January 2015,Miraflores Visitor Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294480-d547531-Reviews-Miraflores_Visitor_Center-Panama_City_Panama_Province.html,"Panama City, Panama",attractions,4.0,4.5
