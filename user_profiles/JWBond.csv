Not worth 4*** - Bad breakfast and poor bar,"We spent a night here in one of the superior rooms in 10th floor.

Hotel staff is very friendly and tries to fulfill the needs best they can.

Rooms are clean and big enough. Shower and bath is fine and bright.
Double bed were two separate mattress on moving beds with a big gap inbetween. And very soft.
Nothing special compared to other lower star hotels.

The breakfast was bad. Due to COVID they served it in a box in the room.
Scrambled egg was very dry. Juice warm.
Two rare toasts. Some cheese and ham. And some Marmelade and honey.
Instant coffee powder provided to make a coffee by our own.
We expected much more for a 4* hotel.

The rooftop bar with pool has a nice view around the city. Some furniture is old and needs some replacement...
They only serve food till 11 PM.
Afterwards it’s very limited - eg you can’t even get a coffee then.
We asked for a dry rose wine - got the most expensive recommended which was very sweet.
For lunch we tried a salad which was sour.
Too poor for the high (premium) price.

The location is not too close to any sightseeing spots...

For us not worth the money and not worth 4 stars *",July 2020,President Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d250590-Reviews-President_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,2.0,3.5
„Define your own“ Small delicious restaurant / cafe with ocean view terrace,"Stopped there for breakfast as the one in our hotel was not good.

There is a nice quiet terrace in the backyard with beautiful ocean view <3
We also got a visit from little birds.

All dishes can be defined individually.
Eg for Omlette and creppe you can individually define all ingredients.
The smoothie can be based on milk, orange juice,...
Taste is great!
Good coffee ☕️

Staff is friendly.

Price is fair!",July 2020,Biscotto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g285708-d6850104-Reviews-Biscotto-Monemvasia_Monemvasia_Municipality_Laconia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Monemvasia, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great view, bad breakfast","We spent one night there to explore the area.

The rooms are clean and (most) oder a nice sea view <3

The bed was old and in some parts stepped down and cracked when one was moving...
The bath was clean. The water taste salty...

Hotel staff is very friendly.

The breakfast is too expensive for what is served. One egg, one bread, one croissant, one slice of cheese and ham, cake and coffee for 7€ is kinda expensive. Better travel over to the island and have some breakfast there with sea view.",July 2020,Petrino Guesthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g285708-d1588221-Reviews-Petrino_Guesthouse-Monemvasia_Monemvasia_Municipality_Laconia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Monemvasia, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
Huge area to learn about the history of Olympic Games,"We spent a few hours here to see the archeological site.

The area is huge and you need 1-2 hours to see everything.
Mind that there is no roof. So it gets hot in the sun

We found it really interesting and enthousiastic to see all these old bricks and stones from earlier times. It really gives you a feeling of how it might have been in that times.

There’s a combo ticket including both museums.",July 2020,Archaeological Site of Olympia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189487-d243256-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Olympia-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Great value for money, centrally located","We spent two nights here shortly after the Corona lockdown.

Rooms are small but clean. Each have their own bathroom.
Modern air condition. Nice balcony
Check-in is flexible.

Small shared kitchen available, enough to make a delicious breakfast

You can reach all sightseeing spots in walking distance.

We only found the bed a bit uncomfortable...",July 2020,Anesi Rooms To Rent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189487-d7063660-Reviews-Anesi_Rooms_To_Rent-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Delicious authentic food,"We spent two evenings here.

Food gets delivered quickly and is tasty. We especially love the Tzatziki and Moussaka.
Feels like traditional recipes used

Wine also available. For our taste a little sweet, but that’s individual preference.

Prices are fair.",July 2020,Anesis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189487-d4054068-Reviews-Anesis-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Local (Sea)food with great view,"We spontaneously visited the restaurant shortly after the Corona lockdown.

Local fish was shown and explained by the chef itself.
Another dish was a big chicken breast steak.
Everything tasted fresh and delicious

They serve good red wine

The view across the beach is amazing.

Prices are fair / cheap.",July 2020,To Kyma,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1028977-d6714330-Reviews-To_Kyma-Katakolo_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Katakolo, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Adventure drive trough a forest of pine trees,"We drove from north (Kalogria) to a beautiful beach on the south (Paralia Kounoupeli). Took appx 2 hours.

Beautiful scenery with fresh looking pine trees next to the sea.

The streets are very rude so a country-enabled car (we had a Mini Countryman) and slow / careful driving is recommended.

We were able to see a group of cows resting next to the street.
Several points to start a hike available.",July 2020,Viotopos Dasous Strofilias,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1071010-d10798209-Reviews-Viotopos_Dasous_Strofilias-Kalogria_Achaea_Region_West_Greece.html,"Kalogria, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great view from the city and the castle‘s history - not worth a extra drive,"We visited the castle as we spent some time in Patras.

It is accessible by foot but you have to take several steps if you want to see everything.
This means that the view from the top is amazing but takes some breath.

You can see the whole city and country from the top by an amazing view

So worth seeing it if you are around but not worth a separate drive.",July 2020,Castle of Patras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189488-d8588754-Reviews-Castle_of_Patras-Patras_Achaea_Region_West_Greece.html,"Patras, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Average medium cost (business) hotel,"Spent a night there to explore the city of Patras. Directly after Corona shutdown.

Hotel Staff is very friendly and helpful. Eg they called me as we forgot a trouser there.

Rooms as big enough and quiet, equipped with everything needed (hair dryer, ironing, safe, mini-bar, ..).
Beds are comfortable

Bathroom is clean but has some minor damages.

Parking garage is tight but easy to find.

Outstanding hospitality with good cost/benefit value,"We spent two nights in the Little Planet shortly after the Corona lockdown.
Beside us one other couple spent time here.

The hotel staff (family-owned) gave us a warm-hearted welcome and was an always available and happy to speak with contact point. That’s how a hotel must be managed

The restaurant (breakfast and dinner option) has an amazing view about the landscape.

Breakfast was served based on our needs on the table. Adding something was always possible. Local products had been used. Delicious

Our room was clean and huge enough for a couple.
The balcony is equipped with chairs and a table - pleasure to spend time there.
Lift to the floors available.
The bathroom was old but clean and big enough!

Swimming pool is available with deep weather depth. Always clean and well organized.

Amazing wine tour and tasing by passionate ecologist,"We held the Nemea Wine Tour hosted by Stefano and Nany in July 2020 shortly after the Corona-Lockdown.
It was one of our main highlights of our tour around the Peloponnese

Stefano and Nancy are absolutely experienced and enthusiastic wine lovers.
As educated ecologist they have an enormous background about all types of wine and it’s production, history and development.

Pickup from our hotel was arranged by them flexible.

In Nemea Region they showed us three wineries where we were able to taste the wines we were interested in / fit to our requirements!
The tours in their production sites and wine cellars had been very informative!
In the second winery we got a delicious lunch with Greek traditional dishes - very tasty

Aside of interesting facts about the region, Greek tradition, Greek wine history they showed us one local archeological site and their own wine yard where we were able to see the difference in the diverse wine grapes.

The day passed by quickly and full of new impressions.
We also received a small present in the end

We will do another tour if we come back ones. Strongly recommend!!!",July 2020,Nemea Wine Tour and Tasting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g1647621-d20320822-Nemea_Wine_Tour_and_Tasting-Nemea_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nemea, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
