grim and gloomy,"Visited here on a Friday afternoon ,,
Ticket desk abandoned , no staff to be found , so had to use the awful ticket machine , that just would not behave . Was on the point of giving up when it finally allowed me some tickets , but not at the seats I selected .
The whole experience not improved by how dark it was in there , a cinema darkened to see the screen I understand but this was the entrance area for crying out load . I could have done with a torch .
And grim? Did I mention the toilets. There is a form in the toilet saying when it was last inspected.
I think on this occasion the criteria used was “is it a sh*thole? “ TICK.",January 2020,Odeon Cinema,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186403-d6558672-Reviews-Odeon_Cinema-Coventry_West_Midlands_England.html,"Coventry, United Kingdom",attractions,1.0,3.0
Alls well,"Stayed here one night on a secret escapes deal , having previously visited for a bar snack and drink whilst passing through .
It was January so it was very quiet with partner and I being the only guests staying , that said in the evening the restaurant was about 40% full .
Quality food and Ale served by presentable and friendly staff , what’s is not to like .
A quality gastro pub type affair and far better than my locally starred restaurant , you felt like you had had a substantial meal , perfect for a cold winters night .
Stayed in room 1 , inside the pub , No complaints whatsoever .",January 2020,The Five Alls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1047001-d2000977-Reviews-The_Five_Alls-Lechlade_Cotswolds_England.html,"Lechlade, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5

4 * Tourist standard,"1st meal on the edge of Plaka , cheap draught beer but this does seem to vary in price at the weekend ( it goes up of course ) . Simple Greek food that we found wholly edible .

Our GO TO place,"Our restaurant of choice in Athens as we ate here maybe 4 times in a week .
You are offered bottled water on seating , which we declined and they brought a jug of tap water instead , this was not wanted as we brink BEER and lots of it .
Its many years since I have been in Greece and the beer situation has improved greatly .
It used to be just Amstel and Heineken , German influence on the brewing industry apparently but now there are some excellent Hellenic lagers to be had , its not beer as a Brit would know it but a great deal better than it was.
The Bottled Alpha would be my choice .
On seating you are given a plate of Tomato , garlic , oil and herbs , the only way to eat this is with a truly fresh pitta bread , you can see these being made in the window and to be honest its simply delicious , a starter in itself .
The salads are large enough to share and the mains are a generous portion .
The deserts , traditional dairy based and delicious ( Crème caramel and Kazandibi stand out ).
The staff , young , multilingual and app equipped , hence the fast service .
I have nothing but praise for the place .",October 2019,Barbadimos Syntagma,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12641648-Reviews-Barbadimos_Syntagma-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5

On the plot,"Stayed here for a week whilst visiting Athens and to be honest the UFH ( Urban frame hotel ) was perfect for our needs , right on the plot at the edge of the Plaka district giving you a less that 10 mins walk to the Acropolis .
You are just over 5 mins from the central square of Syntagma square where you can get either a tube or bus to/ from the airport
The rooms bright , scrupulously clean and airy . The 24 hour reception very helpful and informative .
The breakfast simple but it contains the essentials of OJ and Coffee , maybe could do with a spot of Granola to go with that excellent yoghurt , but I am being picky .

Highly recommended .",October 2019,Urban Frame Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d17519544-Reviews-Urban_Frame_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5

Well worth finding,"Stopped here for lunch with my better half and was quite impressed .
Inside it is very cosy , with a woodburner in the corner for inclement weather .
Fish based menu , which is overstating the obvious that looked and smelt very good with my partner and I going for the seafood chowder which was rich with plump mussels and chunks of haddock in a creamy sauce wit new potatoes and peas shoots . Quite delicious .
It did say it came with homemade bread , not so certain about that . As a home sourdough baker for the last 8 years I would have said that was a chopped up bloomer of commercial origin .
Better to describe it as crusty and on the days you do get to make it yourselves , your customers are in for an extra treat .
The fish shack also benefits from good staff and tasty beer , happy to give it another go when I can",August 2019,The Fish Shack,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1480277-d10468820-Reviews-The_Fish_Shack-Amble_Northumberland_England.html,"Amble, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
There are far better places to eat in warkworth,"Popped in for lunch as a couple , starters of pate and brie came with a perfunctory salad , straight out of the bag with little finesse .
Mains of fishcake , salmon and sea bass apparently and liver and bacon were delivered without any love at all . My main was far to salty to eat and I left at least 70% of it .

1st Class Delivery,"We stayed here for 2 night in August and were both very impressed . Your hosts are very amenable and will do their upmost to help with any issues that you might have .
The building , as the name suggest is old and decorated in a quite charming fashion. Our room , at the top of the house being both bright and comfortable and the breakfast / dinning area has been appointed with an eye to the instagramers out there. Very photogenic.
Top marks for the food quality with special marks for the excellent Craster Kippers , whose wonderful almost peaty smokiness is a national treasure and the ingredients of the “full Northumbrian” .
Also top marks to the bistro evening meal , if you are in Warkworth of a Friday or Saturday evening we highly recommend it . I hope to place a separate review for the bistro at a future date.

Unsurprisingly a fish based menu,"Stopped here as part of a package that included an allowance for dinning . Excellent service due to their very good staff . Nice starter and excellent mussels . I think the acid

"Fair , but could be a bit loud","Ate here on a Friday afternoon and to be honest the food was okay to good , nothing to really shout about but nothing inedible either. Starters okay , Liver parfait really quite generous . As for mains, I did enjoy the belly pork with it pot of gravy .
The venue is something of a cavernous barn , all hard surfaces and though there were several families in there it was just one close to me with an extremely loud 2 or 3 year old who could have done with calming down , that caused issue .

Helpful excellent staff , wonderful room ( for the hotel grade ) , both clean and comfortable.

"Disappointing , try elsewhere","grabbed some food here one evening in November 2018 and frankly we both wished we had not .
We both had the polvo to start . This octopus salad was a little unloved , some seasoning a little more oil and maybe a squeeze of lemon could have infused a bit of life into the dish .

Could be great,"Stopped here for a few night whilst in the area and was initially impressed by the building and room . Very characterful and charming and we stayed in room 15 , which is in the stable block. The room was both pleasant and clean with only the shower cubicle area showing its age . Not bad just , like us all a little more tired than we used to be .
The only draw back we suffered from was you are not too far from smokers corner so even on a Monday night , retiring early was not too successful . Not the smell of smoke but the inane chatter of the smokers meant we did not get any peace until well after 11pm. I think this was mostly down to one guest who would wander around chatting all too loudly into his phone. He did this in the morning as well .
A more discrete and separate smoking shelter would be useful , can I suggest the middle of the river?
Breakfast was okay but we both found the Eggs Benedict a little sharp on the palate.
I tend to use lemon juice as the souring agent for the hollandaise and think the chef may have used white wine vinegar instead , which is valid but I think there may have been more vinegar used with the poached eggs and the overall effect was a little too much. No such issues with the full English which was as it should be .
We also used the restaurant in the evenings ( excellent bar and dinning room presentation supported by superb staff ) .
One evenings Flank/bavette steak was right on the money but the lamb assiette I found disappointing . I read that there may be a new chef on site so a few settling errors are bound to occur but all in all not bad .",October 2018,The Mytton & Mermaid Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1018303-d2224920-Reviews-The_Mytton_Mermaid_Hotel-Atcham_Shrewsbury_Shropshire_England.html,"Atcham, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Whether it be the fillet steak , Tuna steak , a dish that was something akin to a Pork escalope cordon bleu , its Chicken equivalent or the “stuffed burger “ , which I think was some kind of Pljeskavica, nothing was served up that was less than excellent .

Friendly service from the waitress but do spare her blushes , it must get cold in that uniform. Reasonable food and very cheap beer with a couple of draughts brewed specifically for JBB and a menu showing 34 types of draught beer
When in the Ukraine drink Ukrainian beer and if you go for the cheapest that’s about £1.05 a pint but go for the special ,its worth it",June 2018,Just Beer Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294474-d12144522-Reviews-Just_Beer_Bar-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Its Staff are its stars,"Stayed here recently and was well impressed by the experience .
Though the hotel may look a little dated in that old intourist way the staff are bang on the money being helpful and informative giving you good information about the city . Location very much a plus point too",June 2018,Premier Hotel Rus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294474-d305214-Reviews-Premier_Hotel_Rus-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",hotels,4.0,4.0
Good but could be more welcoming,"Ate here recently and was impressed by the range and quality of food if not by the warmth of my welcome. You are opposite the football stadium and I do not know if this coloured things in some way
Ate several classic eastern European dishes but was disappointed they only had German beer on my visit .",June 2018,Petrus-b Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294474-d10195962-Reviews-Petrus_b_Restaurant-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Kiev favourite,"Ate here a few time recently in Kiev as the place was recommended by my hotels reception staff .
Easy to find with a quirky layout and interesting brik a brac . I skipped on the “lard menu” as I just don’t know what I am doing with that but excellent borscht for a starter was superb .
I wished I had more time to work through the entire menu , Not cheap by Ukrainian standards but more that reasonable by ours. Recommended .",June 2018,Pervak,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294474-d1537342-Reviews-Pervak-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Its all about the borscht,"Ate here one lunchtime and we went for the classics , Ukrainian borscht , Pielmienie and cheesecake.
The place is bright, clean with welcoming staff and provided a satisfying lunch.
As the title really , its all about the borscht Ukrainian style , which I much prefer to the more vivid red variety . I am not saying this is the best I have ever tasted , but for the UK it did the trick heady as it was with dill.
I love the way it changes from consommé clarity to a vivid pink as the beetroot and sour cream combine . Sublime and a classic dish and I shall visit again.",May 2018,Slowianka Polish & Ukrainian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186403-d12949641-Reviews-Slowianka_Polish_Ukrainian_Restaurant-Coventry_West_Midlands_England.html,"Coventry, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Bull Bay Vista,"Stayed here recently on 2 night travelzoo deal . Stayed in the excellent room 3 which benefits to windows on 2 aspects so you get a stunning view in a bright and airy room.
Hotel located about a mile out of Amlwch itself but is easily found and is a small but tidy family ran affair which provided an excellent platform to exploring Anglesey for the first time and was very good value . Something that you can not often say in the UK.",March 2018,Trecastell Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g552017-d656180-Reviews-Trecastell_Hotel-Amlwch_Anglesey_North_Wales_Wales.html,"Anglesey, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
A superior chipper for sure,"Ate here a few times whilst in “oh so pretty Beaumaris “ recently and received competently cooked food and superior service. Admittedly both times were well with service hours and we ate upstairs in the bistro rather than the “chipper” itself Over the course of the 2 occasion we tried the Menai Mussels , white bait , seafood chowder and Cod . All very much on the money . Its not a Magpie , but then again few places are but we experienced none of the negatives that are listed by others ,.
Worth a go .",March 2018,Neptune Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g552018-d731026-Reviews-Neptune_Bistro-Beaumaris_Anglesey_North_Wales_Wales.html,"Anglesey, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Nothing looney tunes about this place,"Looking for a light lunch around Newark as we had plans for the evening and spotted this place
My wife and I both had the pork burrito which was excellent , fully loaded but we mistakenly had the mildly spiced version , a bit of salsa would have pushed it to another level .
The Latino behind the counter was welcoming and deserves to do well .
Sombreros on the wall that you can wear to get into the spirit of the place
I think if I worked in Newark this would become an addictive treat",January 2018,Holy Moly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2543934-d12164473-Reviews-Holy_Moly-Newark_on_Trent_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Newark-on-Trent, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
London gin bar prices and poor ale,"Tried this one Friday afternoon as it looked quite smart but found it a little bit more style over content

In need of a spruce up,Popped in for a pint as its style and location do make it hard to miss . My £3 pint was not that bad and one of the cheaper ones to be had around here to be honest . The place itself feels in need of a deep steam clean and a lick of paint,January 2018,Castle Barge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2543934-d2692603-Reviews-Castle_Barge-Newark_on_Trent_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Newark-on-Trent, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Ok ish,"Nice venue in a good location but possibly a bit light academically , this not being a pun on the co located tudor school
Pleasant enough but a bit more junior school focused than one might like , with plenty of touch screens to keep the iPAD generation happy
The TE Lawrence exhibition did contain at least one mistake that I spotted , the calibre of which , ( big clue ) , I will leave for other to spot

"Photogenic , but most castle ruins are","Worth a half hour of your time to take a walk around . Also worth crossing over the other side of the river for a few shots from that aspect .
Generally pretty and you can see why is a favourite for photographs when the recently betrothed emerge from the nearby registry office",January 2018,Newark Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2543934-d3208935-Reviews-Newark_Castle-Newark_on_Trent_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Newark-on-Trent, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5
Not the worst spoons,"Visited here for a few pints overs the weekend and though generally better than my local spoons as staff were quick to serve and I actually saw dirty plates and glasses collected, it could have been better . The thing that really let then down was the collection of lab rats/ crash test dummies stood in the door way smoking , and I do mean in the door way , within the plot line of the building.
The odd bucket of water needs to be thrown over them to encourage them away from the building for this nasty habit , otherwise a purpose built shelter for them in nearby Lincoln would suit",January 2018,The Sir John Arderne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2543934-d3838744-Reviews-The_Sir_John_Arderne-Newark_on_Trent_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Newark-on-Trent, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Boutique Hotel set up,"Stayed here for a couple of night at end of Jan2018 in the delightful room 8 which was both spacious and well decorated although off some highly vertiginous stairs
The Inn has a marvellous boutique feel with an eclectic style of decor and small car park which suited me fine
Breakfast is extensive ( two sides of A4 for the menu ) and they had black sheep on draught , so what could be better?
Answer? A little more organisation maybe . They were going through staff changes when we arrived and it did reflect in a few glitches . My wife made the booking and on arrival I asked for my card to be used . Unfortunately this did not happen and her card was still debited , Minor detail and I am sure things will stabilise

All in all , nice place and nice people",January 2018,Beaumond Cross Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2543934-d2283015-Reviews-Beaumond_Cross_Inn-Newark_on_Trent_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Newark-on-Trent, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Good food and Good People but if using a sat nav to find , read on","Stayed here for two night recently and was impressed by the standards. Stayed in the corvus room which is lovely with a bath & shower combination on suite.
We ate here on both evenings and was impressed by both portion size ( Northern ) and costs
One night, a carvery with more veg than you could wave a stick and on the other a fish pie as big as my head again with a surfeit of veg. it did defeat me
The only problem I had , was finding the place . Apparently it has been reregistered for a post code as my car nav , in a car less than a month old puts the given post code not in byers green but in sperrymoor , 3 miles away Best to use DL16 7NX for a pub on the same street , that worked for me.",November 2017,Thomas Wright House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g12352470-d10809608-Reviews-Thomas_Wright_House-Byers_Green_County_Durham_England.html,"Byers Green, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,5.0
