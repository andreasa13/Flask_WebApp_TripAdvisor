Second chances,"I visited this Greek restaurant a number of months ago and there was a little issue with some meat that was partially burnt. To be fair though there was no fuss and the manager immediately offered an alternative & when we said we didn't want anything different he deducted it from the bill. The waitress was lovely as well but we left a little disappointed. Though we decided to order a takeaway last week to give them another go. WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED! Wonderful food and the same man who offered me an alternative in the restaurant was the gentleman who delivered the food. Lovely man! Food was so nice and excellently prepared and packaged that we ordered again only days later! Wow the meat platter! Insane portions and very very tasty. We are so glad we gave this restaurant a second chance!

Absolutely awful,"When did Pizza Express become a frozen food cafe? Absolutely awful. The starters included Calamari of which was without a shadow of a doubt straight from a well known frozen food specialists supermarket!

The mains got a whole lot worse. Cold Bolognese meat, pasta tasteless and sides again from Iceland. We ordered a pizza and thought they can't get that wrong... we were wrong. Under cooked, tasteless and some what watery. No wonder Pizza Express is on the way out... CLOSE IMMEDIATELY!

Always magnificent,"I will make this review very simple... BEST BURGERS IN LONDON.... BEST I'VE EVER EATEN!

Lol slightly dramatic maybe but me and my girlfriend have been to this particular branch a number of times and it is always spectacular. The burgers are just fabulous and the starters and milkshakes are WOW!

Service was excellent and I will recommend to anyone",September 2019,Gourmet Burger Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d781876-Reviews-Gourmet_Burger_Kitchen-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Not as it was?,"I have been to this restaurant many many times & it more often than not hits the spot. I will not say this visit was hugely different to those experiences but even pre Covid 19 this restaurant has been decreasing in value and quality in my last handful of visits. The price has shot up which again I could maybe understand due to the current climate though if the quality of the food & service becoming some what patchy, then there is no justification for a £5-£6 increase in price per head. I will undoubtedly return one day but it probably won't be for a while. Though again with the way things are at present it wouldn't be fair to mark anything below average at this time.",August 2020,El Vaquero Whetstone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1940711-Reviews-El_Vaquero_Whetstone-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"The course was fun, the area is not safe!",The staff were welcoming & we had fun on the course. Unfortunately the area is not safe & the car park is not secure. I had something from my car stolen and had to have my motor towed home. Very upsetting and I would never revisit or recommend as this £10 day has now turned out to be much more costly. Walthamstow is not safe and this attraction offers no security what so ever.

Slightly disappointed,On arrival finding the hotel was not that simple mostly due to the fact that the hotel flag had been blown into a position where you couldn't see it. Staff did not seem to rushed to sort this out. Even though staff were welcoming it did seem a little false & as most staff seemed quite young it gave a feeling that the place lacked experienced despite trying to appear 5 star and luxury. I can't fault the size of the room & the Thai restaurant was quite nice. I doubt I would return as for the money I paid I was rather disappointed.,February 2020,The Crazy Bear Hotel - Beaconsfield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g499483-d1449624-Reviews-The_Crazy_Bear_Hotel_Beaconsfield-Beaconsfield_Buckinghamshire_England.html,"Beaconsfield, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,3.5
Tay Tar Tasty,"Me & Mini went for another visit to another restaurant on a random Wednesday & we were so happy we did! Greeted well & felt very excited to sample the foods!

We went for the set menu B though I must say the menu itself had our mouths watering. I was thinking at that point if the food is good we'd definitely return!

The starters was nice, I did think maybe it could have been slightly larger but they may be because I'm a bit of a pig! Starters came in 3s for which for a couple may cause a fight over the last spring roll!

The mains were delightful. The duck dish was my favourite but the chicken and lamb dishes were also beautiful. The Pad Thai was the best I've ever had.

The desert was also spledid. They also changed the vanilla ice cream to coconut without fuss.

The overall experience was excellent. Great service, magnificent food & we'll definitely return.",December 2019,Tay Tar Thai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g672161-d10187209-Reviews-Tay_Tar_Thai-Borehamwood_Hertfordshire_England.html,"Borehamwood, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Reserving Judgement,"Driving through Southgate, Greens looked very nice from the outside if not a little dark. I must say it did look like it was closed until we got closer. Inside the decor was very nice but the restaurant is rather small, meaning a number of the tables were very small (later this did prove an issue).

Was greeted nicely by the manager but I got the impression that if you wish to eat here you may be wise to book in advance as only a few tables were available to those who hadn't booked (it was a Saturday evening though, so fair enough).

The waitresses who served us (2 different girls) were both very nice. I did feel though the restaurant is trying to be a bit like a fine dining restaurant but it is very far away from this level, even though the prices are quite expensive for what you get.

Silly little things like not giving us steak knives or condiments until we asked, I mean it's not a big deal but it's little things that sometimes make for a better experience. We ordered the sharing platter for our mains (The Nobleman) & I personally was a little disappointed. Probably more so because I'm not sure it was value for the money it cost.

The meal consisted of the following; Sirloin Steak, Half Rack Ribs, Chicken Wings, Mac & Cheese, Onion Rings, Slaw & thick cut chips (steak fries). The steak was ok. A bit fatty but cooked nicely. The ribs & wings were plastered in BBQ sauce & for us that made them very sweet. Not the worst, but I have had better. The onion rings were certainly not to our tastes as the were essentially a ring of thick greasy batter. The slaw was fine & the mac and cheese unfortunately had blue cheese in it (this is obviously just a personal dislike of ours, I'm sure many others would love this as even I have to admit it was ok). Also wasn't told we could change the thick cut fries for skinny ones, which was a shame but again not a massive issue.

Back to the table sizes... the dish we were served was so big we couldn't get two plates on the table to put the food on. Also both our drinks were on the same side of the table (see picture) because of the lack of space. Just found this a little strange.

The biggest issue for us was that it took 50 minutes for the food to arrive. I personally have a rule that if I'm not served within an hour I leave & they came close! Two other tables that arrived after us were served food before us which I found strange & the other pet annoyance of mine is that staff were eating while customers were waiting.

Of course this is all just personal opinion & speaking with other customers on the night others enjoyed their food & said they would return. I would probably give them another go as the whole experience was ok. The home made sticky toffee pudding for afters certainly left us feeling a lot more happy with the whole experience as that was delicious.

So yes we reserve our judgement and I think 3 stars with a ""give it another chance"" attitude is a fair reflection on Greens.",November 2019,Green's Steakhouse & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d5256808-Reviews-Green_s_Steakhouse_Grill-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Wonderful hotel,"We stayed for 7 nights at the lovely establishment and enjoyed every day of our holiday. When booked it was under 5 star hotels on the booking app I used. I definitely have to say this is Greek 5 star (not meant in a derogatory way) as the room could have been bigger and a bit more modern but this certainly does not take away the fact the hotel & all it's staff were absolutely magnificent. Made some good friends here and would certainly recommend.

Situated in the heart of Athens you may be left a little disappointed with the views from the rooms as it is very much a central city block. But the way Athens is I'm not sure it would be much better anywhere else as Athens is in a serious need of renovating and investment from their government.

But back to the hotel itself I can not fault it. The breakfast was excellent and every morning there are great options and you are greeted with a smile everytime and the service is again wonderful.

Maybe the best way to describe the whole experience is 5* service in a 4* hotel. But I would take it that way round any day rather than the other way round.",November 2019,Pallas Athena Grecotel Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d530568-Reviews-Pallas_Athena_Grecotel_Boutique_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5

Arriva bus ride in Athens!!!,"Firstly I have to say the staff were nice or ok. No issue there. The price seemed reasonable until we actually finished (over 3 hours ‍️).

The tour provides you with headphones (basic but didn't expect better). The quality of the commentary was not great and a number of times didn't necessarily match up with what you were seeing. I started to feel like I was on the 107 bus from Borehamwood to Barnet in Hertfordshire, England.

You really don't get to see much from the bus, well not properly anyway. Yes you can get off and experience Athens, but you seriously should consider using public transport instead of this tour bus. Traffic so horrendous you end up feeling bored & we personally felt sick (not saying you would of course, that was just our experience.

The metro is far better, cheaper, faster & gets you to all the places you need to see.

Would definitely not recommend.

One final mention. The Piraeus line... absolutely rubbish. Get the metro instead as this is seriously . Complete waste of time & money.

Nice pictures but maybe deceiving,Came in November so unsure if it's the same in summer. Looks like this place has been abandoned.

Thank God Pasha didn't serve us!,"Me & my better half went out to try a new restaurant on a random Saturday on borehamwood high street. Pasha had just opened & we saw the menu & thought... yum!

Enjoyable stay,"Me & my partner booked late on the morning of our stay. Was surprised to see a reasonable price and we added the breakfast to the booking. On arrival the only downside was that you have to pay for parking but that was not too expensive & wasn't a deal breaker. Nice warm welcome from the staff & the room was nice.
