Hmm,"Honestly not my kind of museum ... Is a bit boring they have to find a way to entertain the public and kids as well they fall asleep on the chairs which are placed on the edge like saying ""bored? Come here and take a nap"" ... I don't recommend if you're not a lover of the historical stuff and old plates.",July 2018,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Nice,This is historically as well as the museum from the same city but here I found exactly what I needed peace beautiful landscape and lovely architecture. I'm still thinking we're as humans so smart from those years we could do something so amazing. Unfortunately .... For gods. But as experience is the best in Greece .,July 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Lovely,"Well is a lovely place where the food is amazing, why am I saying this? Because it happened here to order the same thing with my girlfriend and unfortunately I didn't realize is a salad so I received a salad and I haven't eaten salad for one year and a half but was so full of flavour and tasty. And we had feta cheese with honey I think is my favourite starter ever, as a desert I ordered a chocolate cake which was so sweet and you could realize is home made from the taste. The staff here is unbelievable helpful, whatever questions we had and requests they managed to make our evening one of the best in Athen. The waiter Vasilis he was the one recommending that lovely cake, and Stefanos he made for us a romantic table.

Seriously everything is amazing you have to try once ... You know what don't believe me ! Go there and you'll see with your own eyes.",July 2018,Elaea Mezedadiko,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10587843-Reviews-Elaea_Mezedadiko-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
