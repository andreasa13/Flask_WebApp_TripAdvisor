Staff very nice,"We stayed here for 5 nights in a pool room near adult pool. Unfortunately pool did not close to 10pm and had loud kids and some adults on the Monday night.
For the price $45 night it was fine. The food was all really nice except for the pizza. The breakfast was average with lots of hot food choices as clientele was mainly Indian and Asian. A bit of a wait for egg station and they could do with a number system as people pushed in and staff were unable to keep track of who was in line next (busy cooking) would have liked fresh pineapple and a fresh pancake station like other hotel.

They said they would not honour booking. By this time my friend was in tears and went up to room. Lots of arguing and they said they will work it out in am . Spoke to manager who wanted to move us to other hotel in cheaper room as they had given us a sweet room - however still wanted $20 AUD night. We had to leave and went to hari piorko which had good clean basic room, better location -near New Delhi metro and the staff very friendly. Street full of good market shopping. Has dampened our holiday and very scary for two females by themselves",January 2016,Hotel Ajanta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304551-d306951-Reviews-Hotel_Ajanta-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,"New Delhi, India",hotels,1.0,4.0
"Amazing room, bathroom and food","This hotel has it all, the room is gorgeous, the bathroom has a proper shower and it is all spotless. We stayed at the hotel across the road - chitrakartha and it was noisy, the room was average and the shower was in with the toilet so the room remained wet after showering. The food at The Pearl palace was very cheap 2 lassies , 2 waffles with ice cream and one lasagna, one pizza 1000 rupees. Wifi great , staff very attentive",January 2016,Hotel Pearl Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d550832-Reviews-Hotel_Pearl_Palace-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jaipur, India",hotels,5.0,4.5
A bit noisy,"This hotel was ok , room clean, shower in with toilet, so floor wet in bathroom all nice after you shower. Noise from outside and within the hotel woke us up on several occasions during the night. We went across the road to The Pearl palace the next night which cost a bit more , but was so much nicer. Wish we could have stayed both nights at The Pearl palace",January 2016,Hotel Chitrakatha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d1771101-Reviews-Hotel_Chitrakatha-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jaipur, India",hotels,3.0,4.5
"Excellent , cheap food","The food was the tastiest so far in India, we had the Thalia which was 230 and was amazing value. It was 6 little bowls of different vegetarian food and 4 pieces roti.

Lovely grounds,"This hotel has the cleanest grounds and garden I have seen. Owner is very friendly and they have the extras like coffee, great towels, perfect sheets. Restaurant food very nice and priced well. 2 drinks and meal $10.00. The area is near the Mandore gardens who have a wonderful Hindu temple. There are lots of family's in area going to pray and we walked around at 7pm with no problems. The people in the temple explained everything to us and we're so kind not asking for money , just happy to talk with us. The grounds are so peaceful and nice and I really enjoyed even though I am not that interested in gardens. Great for family's with toys and swings there",December 2015,Mandore Guest House - a leafy resort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297668-d519617-Reviews-Mandore_Guest_House_a_leafy_resort-Jodhpur_Jodhpur_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jodhpur, India",hotels,5.0,4.5
10 rupees entry,This place made our trip to Jaisalmer. The son of the owner took us through each room and explained all the items to us and about the different cultures and history of India. He was a very funny man and made the story's so interesting and we had an hour of continual laughs with him. They do a puppet show at 7pm however we did not stay to see it. We nearly skipped this place due to a lack of time but are so glad we didn't.,December 2015,Jaisalmer Folklore Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297667-d3913123-Reviews-Jaisalmer_Folklore_Museum-Jaisalmer_Jaisalmer_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jaisalmer, India",attractions,5.0,4.0
"Ok, beautiful to see","Had food and coffee at restaurant near entry of fort something Italy , was wonderful. The fort has a few shops and a museum entry 500 rupees and 100 for camera including audio. Audio was good but did not find museum that exciting. Should have just visited and taken some photos in the fort which is free to enter",December 2015,Jaisalmer Fort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297667-d324658-Reviews-Jaisalmer_Fort-Jaisalmer_Jaisalmer_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jaisalmer, India",attractions,3.0,4.5
