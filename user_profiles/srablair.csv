First meal out since lifting of lockdown 3,"We had a great meal here tonight, our first since lifting of lockdown and we were worried we might be cold at the outside tables, but we needn't have worried there were heaters and also some blankets were brought out later for those that needed them.

Food and service was excellent and a good choice of dishes. We loved the 3 cheese flatbread, the calimari and the Queenie scallops were delicious. I had chicken burger with garlic mayo and blue cheese and my husband had the pulled pork with sweet potato fries.

Beers and gin and tonic went down a treat with it all.

We really enjoyed it and were really pleased we chose to book here to celebrate the relaxation of the lockdown restrictions.

We will definitely be back here soon.",April 2021,Fifty FÃ¸ur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190773-d12540246-Reviews-Fifty_Four-Lytham_St_Anne_s_Lancashire_England.html,"Lytham St Anne's, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Post lockdown (3),"We visited as soon as possible after the lockdown was lifted. Our second visit and loved it here just as much as we had the first time ( which was following lockdown 1!).

Lots of room to spread out. Timed entry times meant that visits are staggered social distancing not a problem.

Castle and surrounds are really interesting. We had kept our guidebook from the last visit and still found new things to learn. I would advise to buy the guidebook. All the English Heritage guidebooks are brilliant little potted histories and lovely to read up after your visit too.

Woodland walk around the castle was lovely. We had taken binoculars to look at the birdlife around as well.

We had tea and biscuits at the outdoors take away kiosk which was a nice way to end the visit. All the volunteers were very friendly and helpful and glad to see us back. Very good to be back. Everything felt very safe. Good toilet facilities.",April 2021,Beeston Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2693018-d216436-Reviews-Beeston_Castle-Beeston_Cheshire_England.html,"Beeston, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
Great way to spend some time,"We were on a long day in Havana and had some time to do the Classic Car tour we had 4 in our car but most others were just couples. We took a lovely drive from the fortress along the promenade, then to John Lennon park before Revolution square and then drive past Capitole and Granma. Excellent value if you have 4 people but still worthwhile as a 2.",January 2021,Havana Vintage Car Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147271-d7763813-Reviews-Havana_Vintage_Car_Tours-Havana_Ciudad_de_la_Habana_Province_Cuba.html,Cuba,attractions,5.0,5.0
Great New Years Eve celebrations,"We enjoyed a great 2 week stay here from 28th December incorporating new years eve.

We noticed there is an SMC medical centre set up on 1st floor to deal with health problems but can arrange covid tests ahead of return flights if required.

 

There is some wifi in the public areas accessible with username and password which could be patchy and slow, but ok if you persevere.

Some of the processes seemed a little strange but we put this dowm to it being Cuba! We would advise considering taking towel for pool / beach use in case of delays getting a blue pool towel.

Also speak to customer services in the foyer to arrange bookings in the speciality restaurants on arrival.

Take Dollars preferably in small denominations for tipping..everyone is really keen to get hold of foreign currency at the moment, although pesos are still good and Cuban Convertibles still valid for 6 months from now.    There is a currency exchange office on 2nd floor along from reception.

Take colouring pencils for any children you might meet as people struggle to get hold of these.

The hotel was using only part of the hotel due to the pandemic, but the 3 speciality restaurants were open at least at the start of our trip. ( lovely Tepanyaki, an Italian and a Cuban).

Good choice of dishes at the buffet, Including traditional Cuban dishes, and served by the chefs to remove contact with serving spoons etc.

The buffet was great for breakfasts lunch and dinner with a good choice of dishes and very good table service for drinks.

Tables well distanced and hand gel used at all entrances.

A special celebration dinner was laid on for New year's eve which we really enjoyed. Plentiful lobster and prawns as well as other dishes which we really enjoyed. Good entertainment throughout which included a regular pianist , singers, bands and conjurer, especially over the new year period. There was a stunning performance of water ballet in the swimming pool at new year ( acrobatics, ballet, synchronised swimming), which was very special.

Disco plays nightly too but didn't go on too late so getting to sleep wasn't too difficult even at the front rooms of the hotel, which overlook the performance areas and patio. Very friendly and hard working staff who really worked to makes things special and enjoyable for us all.

2 large main pools which were great, one swim up bar. Also the hotel has a very nice sloping beach with safe access to the sea and good supply of sunbeds around the pool, garden, and beach areas.

Maid service was great. We had a lovely lady servicing our room who had a great line in towel art which made our stay very special.

The buffet was moved to the 11th floor at the end of the stay ( very few other guests towards the end due to widespread lockdowns), so we were able to enjoy the cracking view from the top floor. This is only available to those in premium rooms usually.

It was a tricky time for the country as they also had a currency change at new year to contend with as well as the pandemic, ( systems had difficulty coping in the first few days which meant we had a few days without pool towels ( used room towels as emergency measure). Perhaps think about taking your own towels as a contingency if sufficient weight allowance.

There are lifts in the hotel. Often these became quite busy,  (and sometimes some were out of action), so we tended to use the stairs. Consider a low room if mobility is a problem.

Hop on and off bus is regular and convenient and a good way to see Varadero. ",January 2021,Iberostar Selection Bella Vista Varadero,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147275-d12130400-Reviews-Iberostar_Selection_Bella_Vista_Varadero-Varadero_Matanzas_Province_Cuba.html,Cuba,hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent stay,"We have enjoyed our week here very much.  Very welcoming and efficient staff from the start with a great welcome at reception.  Meet and greet at meal times was very friendly and we had our temperature taken each time and washed our hands ready for dinner. Fabulous hotel with excellent anti covid processes.

Every chair and table is wiped down with disinfectant after each guest. Mask policy rigourously applied, hand wash at each buffet station and in each lift.

Our room was lovely, very spacious, lots of hot water for showering,  comfortable bed. Wi-Fi throughout all areas.  Room was cleaned every day which was a nice surprise as many hotels only offer room cleaning on request these days. All surfaces well polished and pristine. Style is classic and comfortable with large contemporary built in wardrobes and safe, with Queen Anne style armchairs in the small sitting area and a flat screen TV.

The buffet selection at break fast and dinner is excellent with something different available at each meal. 2 soups each night and excellent selection of salads. Hot dishes varied and nicely cooked and presented.

Good selection of local drinks and cocktails.  Our all inclusive package also included soft drinks water and beer in the mini bar in the room.

Some entertainment each night in the bar which was very good, usually a singer with keyboards and an excellent saxophonist.  Easy listening,  but very mellow and enjoyable entertainment before/ after dinner.

The buffet restaurant is large and spacious with tables spaced to enable social distancing. Loads of hand wash stations.

We were really impressed with the violinist who played during the Sunday break fast service. What a lovely way to begin a Sunday morning.

Cava available with break fast every day should you wish!

Waiting staff at all meals and in the bar were all lovely,  friendly and efficient, ( e.g. great at helping us find an outside table where they could, and bringing drinks if they saw us running short etc).

The a la carte restaurant was only open Friday/Saturday during our stay. Would Definately recommend trying this if you can, it was excellent. Great menu, nicely served in a modern and stylish bistro type restaurant.  Shared tapas to start, crispy prawn and sauteed mushroom  starters, lobster risotto for me and duck for my husband with a shared carafe of rose, and glass of cava on arrival. Banoffee pie, kind of deconstructed, and chocolate souffle with raspberry sorbet. Delicious.

The pool area has been well spaced with alternate beds taped over, however there are plenty of sunbeds around all the pool and garden areas.

Pools are a little bracing in November! However still lovely once you are in.

We had booked the all inclusive package which we found to be excellent value and very convenient as it does away with the need to complete slips of paper all the time. We missed several lunches as we were out most days with the hire car and bought lunch outside, however we still considered the all inclusive package the best way to do it.",November 2020,Hotel Riu Palace Tres Islas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580322-d237063-Reviews-Hotel_Riu_Palace_Tres_Islas-Corralejo_La_Oliva_Fuerteventura_Canary_Islands.html,"Fuerteventura, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.5
Changing of the guard,"The changing of the guard is a great free show, every day on the hour with a full ceremony on a Sunday morning. All in front of the parliament and the tomb of the unknown soldier.

Fantastic modern cultural complex,"Fantastic modern complex. Short taxi ride from Sygrou Fix metro station, â¬5 fare.  We had a good walk around enjoying the place. Dancing fountains out front every 15 minutes at weekends. Green roof Definately worth a walk,  fantastic achievement getting a fully mature garden including some sizeable trees into the roof! Very peaceful place with benches to sit for a while.  Pedestrianised bridge takes you over towards the marina to continue your walk. Views of the neighbouring archeological site and Olympic venues. Also home to the National Library, a great modern building. 

Stunning modern  opera house complex.

The auditorium itself is everything you would expect from a modern opera house. Acoustics were excellent for the performance we saw of Madama Butterfly.  All seats had a real-time translation facility into Greek or English from the original Italian which was great. We were in the stalls all socially distanced and masks etc. I noticed that in the upper levels the seats are all angled side on to get a front view of the stage, excellent design. Beautiful bright auditorium with comfortable seating.  

There is a bistro at the entrance of the theatre serving drinks and snacks. Welcome as the theatre bars were closed currently due to the pandemic.

We spent around 4 hours here at a weekend and really enjoyed the walk around the gardens and taking the lift up to the green roof.  So glad we came back here during the day following the fantastic performance of Madama Butterfly the previous evening.

Welcome break in the museum visit,"A nice restaurant. We had meatballs and shared fries, with water and fanta. Not overpriced for a museum. Waiter service during pandemic, so there was a short wait for our meals but not excessive. It's a large airy restaurant and large outside dining area in good weather, but it was a little too cold for that on the day we were there. We were given a glass of water and the menu immediately on sitting down which was great.
Food was tasty and just the right portion size for lunch.",October 2020,Acropolis Museum Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2076068-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Excellent museum,"Excellent museum. Good value at â¬10 each.

There is an archaeological site underneath the actual museum which they will eventually open to the public . Currently you can look down through the glass floor and see the ancient living areas below!

This is a companion piece to the Acropolis itself as it houses many of the marble friezes, statues, deities, columns and panels etc that have been removed from the Parthenon to protect them from damage from the elements.

Beautiful artworks. They have been replaced by moulds and casts on the actual buildings, so it's lovely having done the acropolis visit to come here and see the originals.

This is a new housing for the museum, built 2009 and has everything a modern museum needs to take good care if it's artefacts. They have all the Parthenon frieze that is there around an enormous hall running around all 4 sides so we can see it how it would have been seen. It's such a shame though that so many if the pieces are missing, either because they have been lost or destroyed in war etc, or taken away somewhere! They are still angry at Lord Elgin who bought some of them from the Turkish occupiers in 1802. 2 sides to every story of course, and some if the pieces are in the Louvre, or the Vatican and other museums so it isn't just the British who are culprits! However, any arguments that the British have better facilities to keep them safe, don't wash anymore now that they have excellent facilities for them here. There is also one of the Caryatids, from the temple of Erechthion which Lord Elgin took a fancy to, which is also in the British museum. There is a space on the plinth here ready for when it is returned.

I do really think now that there needs to be a conversation about a plan to bring these pieces home to Greece. There must be some kind of agreement or compromise. Same for other museums around the world I imagine. It does seem silly really, there are some figures that have been found missing limbs or a torso that they know is in the British museum. Seems only decent to at least reunite body parts of the same statue!

They had a 3 D model of the Acropolis area which is helpful in getting your bearings in the city!

Also a very nice restaurant and excellent toilet facilities.",October 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing archeological find,"It took us a while to find as part of our combined ticket, but so delighted we came. Fairly recent discovery when an army barracks was dismantled in just mid 90s.

With a bit of imagination you can put yourself back to the times when Aristotle and Socrates would have been thinking big thoughts under a tree here! Also a gymnasium and maybe the first University, you can imagine the philosophical debate happening here as well as the wrestling and boxing that took place. Some of the narrow paths are blocked off now in the pandemic, as is the cafe and most of the garden, but even so, one if our favourite sites to visit.",October 2020,Aristotle's Lyceum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d7718083-Reviews-Aristotle_s_Lyceum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.0
Oldest theatre in the world.,"This is an important part of a visit to the Acropolis slopes. Although not completely restored, the lower levels of seating are complete and you are able to get a feel for how it must have looked, 2,500 years ago in 5th and 6th century BC. Amazing to think about the early performances there, plays, tragedies, satires, recitations, performances of Homers work, etc also Plato, Euripedes, Sophocles, Aristophanes.

Important part of visit to Acropolis,One of the temples in the Acropolis complex that has been completely restored.

Fantastic welcoming base,"We had a great week here. Great location, near to the metro but easily walkable to most of the landmarks.

Great welcome on arrival, hand sanitiser station at the front door. All staff wear masks. Felt very safe.

Modern boutique style, we had a corner suite which had a sitting area, a small dining area with a compact kitchenette area, fridge, microwave, kettle, small hob, coffee maker, toastie maker, (crockery removed during the pandemic, but disposable cups and cutlery provided fresh daily).

Airy and spacious , I loved that we could get the 2 full size sliding windows, (double glazed so lovely and quiet when closed,  important in this central location, and glad that we had a high floor), fully  open each day to change the air in the room, but there is very effective AC for overnight. Room serviced each day with tea and coffee making provided, and it was lovely to come back each afternoon to a shiny clean room. Many hotels only service on request these days so this was a nice surprise.

Shower room modern with high spec fittings.  Plenty of hot water and lovely strong water pressure in the shower which took us by surprise first day, so be careful!

The reception team took the time to get to know us during our stay and were able to advise on travel arrangements etc.

We were very grateful also for the room extension which enabled us to shower and change before setting off for the airport.

We felt we were among friends here and were genuinely sorry to leave.",October 2020,NLH Fix - Neighborhood Lifestyle Hotels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d11913451-Reviews-NLH_Fix_Neighborhood_Lifestyle_Hotels-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
We loved it here!,"The Ancient Agora is huge and we needed a good few hours to get around everything. There was a good museum there with some of the art and statues taken from the site. Well preserved with some conservation work still ongoing, we were glad of our guidebook to supplement the information boards as we went round.

Interesting that the government was by an administrative assembly (boule), which was made up of 50 people from each of the 10 tribes of Athens, 500 governors in total that served for a period of 35 days each before swapping, so by the end of the year, all tribes had been represented.(10 month year at this stage). There was the remains of one if the most important buildings that hosted debates and was also where goods were measured, a kind of weights and measures department (tholos).

Lots of temples and historical buildings or remains of them. I was interested to learn about the history of Athens, before the Romans invaded in 86 BC. They developed a strong economy and were doing ok for centuries, then the Persians invaded and knocked them flat, robbing them of their wealth and treasures. They picked themselves up and became even stronger over the next 300 years, but then the Romans invaded in 86 BC, and were in power until around 500 AD, so they haven't had it easy really. A lot of the Ancient sites we saw are from the Roman era, but not all, and it was good to see the whole story.

In the Ancient Agora there is the middle stoa which would have been a place for business and commerce and also for people to meet one another. It was said that Socrates would have frequented here.

Apparently also Socrates was held in the prison here and it was here that he died after taking hemlock. Very sad, and I didn't know of the circumstances of his death.  As suspected, turns out he was accused by the authorities of anti democratic teaching but really it was questioning the authority of the deities, for which  he was found guilty and was executed by being made to drink hemlock. I'm not sure if that makes me feel better about it or not, knowing that he didn't choose to go that way.

Spent nearly 3 hours here.",October 2020,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Interesting but didn't need much time,"We were glad to have seen this, as we might not have bothered had we not had the combined ticket, as it would have been expensive at â¬8 each.

There is one major monument here which is visible from the road.

We enjoyed our walk around the monument which is under some reconstruction and conservation currently so get all the way round. There are also Roman baths here which are interesting too. The monument to Zeus was started by the Greeks in 450 BC but wasn't actually finished until 1132 AD in Hadrians time.

All adds to the picture and is an iconic part of the Athens skyline so we are glad we took the time to visit.",October 2020,Temple of Olympian Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242844-Reviews-Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0
A Must see,"Tickets were available on line but these days we are encouraged to buy them on line in advance and download them to our phones.

We went in at the entrance nearest the Odeon of Herodias which seemed less busy than the one nearest the metro station.

There is a lot of ongoing restoration work at the Acropolis which is interesting in itself, we spent around 3 hours there and walked miles up and down to the Parthenon, temple of Athena Nike, and various other temples mostly from 2nd century BC to 2nd century AD. Incredible amount of history here and you can just imagine yourself here a few thousand years ago. Really gives us an insight into how life might have been. The route around the site takes us around and down to the old theatre of Dionysus, which is well preserved from 500 years BC, which was really interesting and gave us an idea about cultural life around that time. The orchestra was an important part of performances even then, and apparently there was an annual festival for poets and musicians to show their talents in a competition. There was an example of a bust made in honour of one if the participants even though he didn't win, but must have been very good, Menendere. There were hundreds of seats (5000), in the auditorium, so the concerts must have been good. They listened to plays, comedies and tragedies and satire. ( I had never heard the word tragedian before!).

Interesting part of the visit,"Interesting to see the sacred olive tree and were speculating whether this was the same tree after 2000 + years. Even if not, we certainly felt the weight of history here, absorbing all the events of the last 2.5 thousand years and marvelling that these temples and deities were exactly the ones that Paul referenced in his sermon here across the hill at Areopagus in 54 AD. The temples at the Acropolis including this one would have been here when Paul visited ( they would have been 500 years old at that time). Stunning temple.

Highlight of a visit to the Acropolis,"While this is still an archeological restoration with plenty of work in progress, it is a stunning work of antiquity which you can't really miss.

The Parthenon is visible from any hill in Athens however up close you can see a lot of the detail in the friezes.
Some of the most vulnerable parts are replaced with moulds and the originals in museums to protect them from further damage. However this does not detract from the enjoyment of the site and we were able to imagine ourselves back in time. Look out for the details of the horse and man representing the fall of Troy.

The reconstruction and conservation work has been in progress for decades and one of the cranes doing the lifting has been in place since 1964 and about to be replaced and supplemented with 2 more.

It's a beautiful arch to honour the emperor Hadrian (same Hadrian we know from the wall in the UK), and we took some good photos of old and new, through the arch with ATM machine in view!

The lower part of the arch is Greek in style where the upper part is Roman.

I enjoyed both the dark chocolate and cherry ripple cheesecake flavour and my husband enjoyed his brioche flavour with the freshly made waffles drizzled in chocolate praline was superb.

We did almost get a 3 scooper with a waffle and share it between 2 which would have probably been enough but we were feeling indulgent today.

Beautifully cooked, each bite was perfectly cooked and seasoned.

We had the Vergina beer which was great, chilled and very refreshing.

The hosts generously gave us an ouzo on arrival which started the evening well.

It's near to the Library of Hadrian and quite central, but even so, the prices are not too high. Being lunchtime we only needed a quick bite so we each had a pork giros pitta, with a shared Caesar salad and Fanta, with a bottle of water.

The service was very friendly and efficient and we weren't rushed along at all. We were very interested in their very clever automatic gyros slicer too!

The beers and food arrived swiftly in plenty of time for us to enjoy it.

We ordered plated pork giros which came with fries, and tomatoes and tzasdiki.

The pitta was soft and delicious. The pork is sourced from their own farm so you know it's good.

Really tasty, the pork was crisp and salty just as it should be and we were delighted to have something traditionally Greek having only just landed, we really felt that we had arrived.

"Lovely dinner, lovely people","We enjoyed a great dinner here tonight. We had the oven baked meatballs with tomato sauce, and I had the main course of the day, moussaka, which was delicious.

My husband had 2 large glasses of a local draft beer which he enjoyed, and I had ouzo and lemonade which is a bit old school now I think, but they found me some anyway and it was lovely with my moussaka. We had a garlic bread as a side dish which was lovely and garlicky.

Everyone was really hospitable and friendly taking time to chat which made for a very pleasant evening.

Many thanks we had a lovely evening with you and hope to come back again.

Really delicious and inexpensive, even with 2 bottles of fanta came to around â¬8 the lot!

Great dinner,We enjoyed our dinner here. My husband had the mixed skewers which were very good and I followed a recommendation from a fellow reviewer and tried the kebab stuffed with cream cheese which indeed were delicious. Husband had a few beers and I had a small glass of house red. The bottled beers were a little small so we wished we'd ordered draft.

Fabulous full day trip,"Easy to get to from Rome Termini station changing at Eur Magellan or Piramid.

We had a full day out here as there is a lot to see.

We took a picnic for flexibility and there are lots of areas under the trees and benches to rest for a while. However there is also a cafe.

We really enjoyed exploring the town at our own pace, and spent around 6 hours here. I advise good walking shoes, water and sun screen.

It's amazing how well preserved everywhere is, you can really imagine life here, as though you arrived in a time machine.

The Theatre /Amphitheatre is accessible and still apparently used in normal times.

There is plenty of room here and it's very easy to socially distance. Hand sanitiser around the place to keep everyone safe.

Reasonable entrance fee at just â¬12 each plus â¬2 for a map. For the amount of history we absorbed during the day, and the quality and extent of the site this seemed very reasonable. We saw conservation work in action and there is more to do, I expect this is dependant on some more funding.

It's a great place to spend some time, mosaics, friezes, temples, remains of colourful wall paintings, all jaw dropping. I loved that the bakery and fishmongers shop had been identified and the shopping area. All contributed to the immersion into ancient Rome that this place represents.",October 2020,Parco Archeologico di Ostia Antica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g673275-d292711-Reviews-Parco_Archeologico_di_Ostia_Antica-Ostia_Antica_Province_of_Rome_Lazio.html,"Ostia Antica, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5

Ornate monument with great views,"We enjoyed our visit here. It encompasses the tomb of the unknown soldier and celebrates the reunification of Italy.
Great views from the top. A free entrance attraction and Definately worth the walk up. One way system in operation so once in you are committed to the full tour. However this is well worth doing.

Small cafe at the top. Toilets are at the bottom at the end of the tour down several flights of steep steps.

A must see and worth the climb,"We had a bit of trouble finding this, but so glad we got here as it is a gem of a place. It is on the Oppian hill near the colisseum and looks quite plain from the outside but beautiful once you step through the door.

Includes main attractions from art lovers is the mausoleum of Julius 2nd, with its wonderful Michelangelo enlightenment of Moses.

Also the chains displayed as a relic reputed to be the chains that held st Peter in Jerusalem and Rome. Unlike some churches, you are welcome to sit down here for private prayer and quiet reflection.

Great trip,"We visited here as part of a combined ticket. You can see quite a bit of the Forum from the road and there are some information boards around. However I would recommend spending some time here with the downloadable Vox guide/ audio guide to properly understand the context and detail.

There is a lot to see and plenty of walking to be done. We enjoyed seeing the temple of the Vestal virgins although this was currently under renovation. The arch of Titus and the Temple of Saturn are very spectacular.

The temple of the divine Romulus is amazing for its state of conservation, as is temple of Castor and Pollux.

Well worth a few hours of exploration.

Great views over Rome,"Great place to visit with wonderful views over Rome, we visited here as part of a combined ticket including The Colosseum, Palatine Hill and the Forum. However we found that this did not include access to the museum and the House of Livia, so investigate this before you go. We were pretty tired after seeing every thing else and so weren't that upset to miss the museum, however would have been nice for completeness. Our ticket included the downloadable Vox city guide which was useful in all 3 locations.

Palatine Hill includes the home of Augusta and the world's first botanic gardens. As you get further up the hill you see more of the residences of the emperor's of Rome, so they get posher! Save the visit to the gardens til the end so you can finish with a stunning view over the whole of ancient Rome including the Colloseum and the Forum.

"Great visit, very helpful curators","We really enjoyed our visit here, there is a lot to see and we certainly got our steps in by the end of the day. Good one way system to keep social distancing, which guides you through a succession of rooms and exhibits which just keep getting more amazing. Exchange your on line ticket for a real ticket at the booking office. All expected security and covid processes, temperature checks etc, masks on at all times of course.

There is a good well priced restaurant for lunches and snacks. There was no problem with getting back into the system after lunch to visit the other side of the museum, a kind curator simply directed us round to loop back around as often as we wished. There are so many rooms which are unmissable, the Raphael rooms are superb, the Cartography rooms, and then at the other side there are the Greek, Roman, and Egyptian rooms which in any other setting would be the highlight, however here there is one highlight after another.

Communications were great, with all staff speaking some English. I appreciated the frequent emails of welcome and support throughout our stay too.

Room was lovely and quiet as requested on 7th floor, so we had a lovely view across the rooftops of Rome.

Very good anti covid processes, sanitiser, separation etc.

Simple but well managed buffet break fast, with buffet served to us, and dishes refreshed throughout service.

Lovely rooftop bar for cocktails from 4.30pm to 10.30pm each night.

Our room was serviced each day which was a nice surprise. (A lot of hotels only service on request now).  Leave your key with reception each time you leave, this helps their fire and evacuation process in the event of emergency but also will let them know when it is safe to enter your room to service it. There is always someone on reception so no worries there.

The menu was very comprehensive, and the waiter recommended the fish, sea bream with freshly made spagetti with shellfish.

Really delicious, the fish was cooked beautifully and was soft and delicious.

My husband had spagetti with meatballs which he said were also very good.  He had a beer, I had a 1/4 l carafe of house red which was lovely, room temperature, exactly right.

We had some bruchetta with garlic and truffle to start.

Overpriced poor service,"We came in today in desperation as it was raining heavily and needed to get into some shelter. Felt pressurised to order something before we were even seated, I imagine before we could see the prices on the menu, which you have to really search for. The coffee is really criminally overpriced at â¬12 and I was incredulous when I realised the price of the spagetti and meatballs I had ordered at â¬24, and a slice of cake at â¬12. They also bang on a service charge of 17% which is excessive. They tried to claim that service wasn't included, seeking a further tip, which we did not give, needless to say.
A side order of garlic bread arrived which we did not order, which may have been an honest mistake, or an attempt to get us for another â¬20, who can say.

Fabulous house and gardens with fabulous 18th century features, a step back in time. Enormous estate with plenty of opportunity to get our steps in. The walk up to the arch at the end of our visit was worthwhile for the views and to learn about its origins.

The area is huge and there are a lot of monuments to see. The walks through the trees are so peaceful and I found a few trees that seemed happy to be hugged!

Nice cafe, but leave extra time for queuing at busy times as it gets very busy.

Great relaxing weeks holiday,"We had a great time here. Important to note that there is plenty of room here, spacious pool areas, garden areas and beach, and plenty of sunbeds for everyone, so even with social distancing we didn't ever have a problem finding a comfortable place.

The meals are served in the large restaurant and are buffet style, with food being served rather than self service.  The dishes were varied and delicious, with fresh and varied salads, cheeses, hams, and always a variety of hot dishes, grilled meats and fish. I enjoyed the fish stew and traditional dishes such as beef stew with pulses.  The dessert section was always very tempting and the dishes were always freshly baked and delicious, such as the baklava. 

The room was spacious and clean. We had a sea view room on the second floor which is pretty much ideal as on cooler nights you can leave the balcony door open and sleep with the fresh sea air rather than AC, and go to sleep and wake up with the sound of the sea which is fabulous for de-stressing.

Enterprise car hire has a desk in the lobby so we hired a car for 3 days pick up and drop off at the hotel so very convenient and not too expensive.

Room service is on request at the moment to minimise contact, so we asked for a clean and fresh towels and bed linen at the halfway point while we were out for the day, which worked very well. This was perfectly ok for us as the towels dry really quickly in this heat, so we never had to go without a dry towel.

There is a good animation team with lots of activities going on for those up to it! We were very happy to do the aqua aerobics (every day except Thursdays), to keep toned up.  Pool is lovely, well maintained and they keep a shallow end for children.

At the moment they are only opening the one a la carte restaurant which alternates Greek and Italian specialities. Guests are limited to one booking per week booked in advance due to limitations on numbers.

There are a number of bars around which are all good. Service is very friendly and we quite often have our drinks refreshed without having to ask if the friendly barman notices we are running dry! Also a creperie, and a kofte station which offer lovely seasoned koftes, on a skewer  with bread, just the perfect size for a snack at lunchtime. 

There is a small town within a 10-15  minutes walk along the beach with other restaurants if (as we did), you want to vary things a bit on a longer stay.

Beautiful cove for swimming, or just enjoying the view and taking photographs.

It's a 20 minute walk up to the monastery from here, and although it is possible to drive up further, it's a very narrow road controlled by traffic lights, so unless you have mobility problems I would suggest taking on the walk and enjoy the view as you go!

The monastery is lovely, we sat for a few minutes of quiet reflection and took the opportunity to light a candle, (donation invited). There is also a small museum which was fascinating, great collection if liturgical vestments, religious artworks and prayer books, some from the 15th century.

Anniversary dinner,"We loved it here, and had a great meal from the 3 course special menu. We had mussels on the grill and taramasalata to start, then a grilled sea bream, and grilled prawns, which came with plenty of fresh veg and salad. We both had Myhas draft beers which were great. Service was really friendly and food excellent, the prawns were massive and delicious, cooked really simply on the grill, as was the bream.
When we saw the fish in the ice cabinet as we came in, we knew we in the right place. Excellent for fish, and lots to choices on the menu too. The special 3 course menu includes dessert, we had lemon pie and Tiramasu which were lovely.

It was our anniversary and were really pleased with our choice of restaurant, great food and staff, and all with a view of the sea only a few feet away. Very generous hospitality, we were offered a complimentary drink before we left which was a great touch.",September 2020,Alexandros Greek Taverna on the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1073593-d4918618-Reviews-Alexandros_Greek_Taverna_on_the_beach-Roda_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Interesting afternoon,"We enjoyed our afternoon. Most of the house is open now but a few roped off sections. This was our second visit so not the same impact as the first time but still a great collection of paintings and artefacts. No curator talks of course this time, although there is a 3 minute video at the start of the house tour. (Masks required). We had time this time to walk up to the folly and got good views from there.

I advise using the loos near the cafe as the ones at the front entrance are now gone, so the nearest loos after that are round by the orangery.

We were short of time as the only entrance slot available was 2.00 and it closes at 4.30, however it is a great place to visit especially if you can get an earlier slot and if you have time to visit the cafe before it closes all the better.

Birthday treat,"We enjoyed our late lunch here very much. I had a voucher for a free glass of prosecco for myself and my husband as it was my birthday, so that was lovely.

We had prawn and langoustine cocktail and chicken wings to start and then we had the black angus ribeye, and the 8oz fillet for me. Both were delicious, the rib eye was on the rare side of medium rare, but both steaks were tender and well prepared and served. Both came with both salad and choice of potatoes and steak and salad dressings. The wine list by the glass was good and we chose the house merlot with the steak course.

There was hand sanitiser on entrance, and even though there were no masks worn, the tables are well spaced so we felt quite safe. We were there at 1.00pm on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy.",September 2020,Miller & Carter Lytham St Annes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190773-d12533907-Reviews-Miller_Carter_Lytham_St_Annes-Lytham_St_Anne_s_Lancashire_England.html,"Lytham St Anne's, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Great place to visit,"We called in for a visit to break our journey back from Scotland. We had bookended our trip as we visited Birdoswald on the way up, so this all added to our understanding of the history of the area, from the Romans to Henry 8th.

There is a lot of the priory still standing, and you can really get a feel for the place. The guidebook is a lovely resource which provides a map as well as some illustrations which helps to envisage how it must have looked in the 12th century.

We spent around 90 minutes there, before going into the parish church,  managed by the C of E now, but actually part of the original priory. The church is open for private prayer, but do allow photographs , just leave a donation on your way out.

Although not part of English Heritage, there is a lovely cafe, tourist information and shop just at the entrance to the site, which I would recommend for tea and cake after your visit.",August 2020,Lanercost Priory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2161401-d2372537-Reviews-Lanercost_Priory-Lanercost_Brampton_Cumbria_England.html,"Lanercost, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great couple of hours visit,"We called in to spend some time and take  a rest from a long drive further north.

We had wanted to visit for some time and so we were delighted to book a slot. 

I recommend the guide book which heÄºps to describe how various rooms and arches etc. would have looked. Well preserved, there is a lot to look at, and we learned a lot particularly with the help from the guidebook.

It's a large site to walk around, so I would recommend bringing water and picnic to keep your energy levels up.

You really get a sense for what life must have been like here for a Roman soldier and also for the civilians stationed outside the walls of the fort.

There is a glimpse into how the excavation work is completed too, and is a fascinating couple of hours worth.

Mid week dinner,"We came here for a mid week dinner and to meet family. Pleasant enough experience and lovely views across the Firth of Forth. We were a bit worried that the tables were quite close together, although back to back we were probably ok. We had the Haddock and chips which were ok, although one of us reported theirs was a little off heat. They responded well to a problem in the kitchen with one of the dishes and arranged a replacement dish on the house.

Friendly waiting staff who were very patient when we needed more time to order, as we were busy catching up!

I was surprised that they aren't taking part in the ""eat out to help out"" initiative as everywhere we have been in August ( monday to wednesday), so far has taken part. In my view they are missing a trick there as it's a great way of encouraging regular custom, particularly for a family pub restaurant such as this one.

Great way to see the city,"We decided on a bus tour of Edinburgh to save our feet having walked a lot the previous day. The all day hop on hop off pass cost Â£16 and is good value as it lasts you 24 hours. We used every minute of this doing the red route, then the green and picked up the blue route the next morning, hopping on and off occasionally to have a tea and cake or investigate something on foot.

We hesitated at first as we didn't know if we would get the value. However I can thoroughly recommend it especially if you have 2 days to spread the use.

The commentary/ guide is very interesting and made engaging by being amusingly told. 2 of the routes are headphone commentary and one is by personal guide, both are good. The guides are very funny and make the tour interesting and engaging. Always good to learn something new.

Lovely staff but disappointing room,"Needs some work to improve the experience here. Some storage would help, and unsticking the windows would be very easy and would have made it more bearable. Very, very small room. Very challenging conditions for a 4 night stay.  We arrived on the hottest day of  the year to find the windows were all painted shut, and so it was impossible to get any ventilation into the room. The painting had obviously been completed recently, so not only could we not open the windows, the heat and the fresh paint had produced very strong paint fumes which set off my allergies, so I had puffy eyes each morning. 

There was a standard type electric fan in the room, however this was unusable as it made a loud noise like a pneumatic drill so you certainly couldn't have it on for more than a few seconds at a time. To be fair, on the last night we noticed that some sort of cooling had been engaged in the hallway outside so we were able to get some relief by wedging the door open, obviously had to close it overnight though.

There is no storage and there are no flat surfaces in the room, so anything you lay down ends up on the floor.  There is one ""antler type"", hanger on the wall for jackets, and that's all, so we just lived out of a suitcase for 4 nights. 

There was no remote control for the TV, which wasn't working anyway and couldn't be used even manually.

The shower room is tiny, camper van style, so your feet are in the shower when on the toilet, which is diagonal to the door leaving little room to dry yourself when stepping out of the shower. There is however, hot water for showering if you wait 5 minutes for it to run hot.  The hotel is very basic with no restaurant however only a short walk to McDonald's down the road for break fast.   We had what was described as the best room in the hotel. I imagine this is due to the view which is good. There was a good view out over Princes Street and the castle which was the one redeeming feature.

We booked 4 nights here 9 months ago in anticipation of the tatoo which of course was cancelled. I would have felt better about it i think had we not been held to paying twice as much as the room is worth,  (obviously during the tatoo people accept more privations due to the numbers of people staying, but we weren't allowed any leeway ( such as a voucher for the extra cost to use on another occasion, or to change the booking to 2021.

The reception staff were pleasant enough and I don't blame them, they didn't design the hotel after all.

We have stayed in lots of budget hotels so our expectations are managed, however this place is a design nightmare. Not designed for customer experience so much as number of rooms they can cram into limited space with minimum square feet per unit.  If only we could have got some ventilation into the room we would have felt much better.",August 2020,easyHotel Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186525-d1901809-Reviews-EasyHotel_Edinburgh-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",hotels,2.0,3.0

Great day out,"We had a day spare, so when we passed by on the tourist bus we decided to look in.

It's a lovely botanic gardens, lots to see and gives a good walk with lots of interest.

My favourite aspects were the wonderful mature trees which will have had a lot of stories to tell and didn't seem to mind too much when I hugged them! Also the wonderful edibles garden with demonstration of the various coppicing and grafting techniques for fruit trees. Lovely examples of brassicas, also courgettes and squashes, I was very jealous! Obviously very hard working gardeners here.

Free entry and a few cafes open. We gave up on the terrace cafe when there was a 50 minute queue and only one poor soul serving. The ice cream booth near the east gate was very good though and we bought soft drinks and ice creams and a cake bar to see us through.  The glass houses weren't open yet which was a shame  but we will have to come back again to see those.",August 2020,Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d189665-Reviews-Royal_Botanic_Garden_Edinburgh-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great early dinner,"We wanted to try this place as it has got a great reputation and we were curious to try it.  We booked an early table at 4.30 which was the only slot available. 

It was well worth it, as the food and service were great! We both had lamb shanks, me with mustard mash and my husband had black pudding mash.

We both had a pint of Stewarts lager with it which went well with the sharpness of the lamb gravy which was tomatoey and a touch of balsamic, I think. The lamb shanks were delicious and the meat fell easily off the bone, obviously had a really lovely slow cook. Our waitress was really friendly, good hygiene pricesses in place, one way system to the toilet, track and trace QR code system easy to use.

We each had a pint of Innes and Gunn lager and a sharing plate of chicken with extra wings. Served with chips and salad and 2 sauces. The pepper one was a bit fiery but lovely nonetheless and quite moreish! friendly service, hygiene processes all in place. Good Track and trace processes for anyone with a mobile phone.

Fantastic dinner,"We visited here during our short break to Edinburgh and were delighted to bag a table as it is obviously very popular. For good reason. The welcome and service was very friendly and efficient, and excellent hygiene processes in place, so we felt very safe.

Food preparation and presentation is excellent, and a great wine selection including by the glass.  We both had the scallops to start which were specials that day, then duck parfait, and risotto for mains. They handled my husband's celery allergy very well, discretely pointing out any dishes to avoid, and making a minor adjustment, swapping out lentils for mash to avoid a trace of celery.  They had managed to make the restaurant virus safe with plastic screens etc, without minimising the lovely intimate feel of the place, so we were able to enjoy an intimate bistro dining experience whilst having plenty of safe space around us. We had a lovely evening here.

Needed longer here,"A lovely cathedral with a lot to see and learn. We felt a bit hurried out after 45 minutes as the cathedral closed for cleaning. There is a lovely app to download for a virtual tour of the cathedral with lots of information about aspects of the cathedral, explanations of the stained glass windows etc. I felt that you need a lot of time to get through the virtual tour on the app, but that there is a danger of missing the big picture, ie that this a place of worship. We would have like a small seated section set aside for private prayer so that we could take a few minutes to sit quietly and absorb the atmosphere rather than just looking at the detail of the stained glass, beautiful as it is.

There was some restoration going on ( cherry picker in the middle of the nave), so maybe there were some logistical issues around this.

The shop was closed so we couldn't buy a guide book which was a shame and the crown jewels weren't accessible today. There were headphones available with audio guide but I always find these a bit insular, so we just downloaded the map. They did have several of the QRCode type downloads of info at points around the castle which contributed to our enjoyment of the day. The indoor sections that we're available are well worth a visit, the great hall, and especially St Margarets chapel are worth some time queuing.

I had a Greek salad which was fresh and delicious and my husband had the giros plate which was great and came with massive side salad, tzasdiki, and fluffy pitta bread.

We used every minute of this doing the red route, then the green and picked up the blue route the next morning, hopping on and off occasionally to have a tea and cake or investigate something on foot.

We hesitated at first as we didn't know if we would get the value. However I can thoroughly recommend it especially if you have 2 days to spread the use.

The commentary/ guide is very interesting and made engaging by being amusingly told. 2 of the routes are headphone commentary and one is by personal guide, both are good. The guides are very funny and make the tour interesting and engaging. Always good to learn something new.

Masks to be worn inside the bus, but ok with outside areas on the upper deck, fortunately it stayed mostly dry during our tours.  The buses are thoroughly cleaned regularly between each tour. The buses are frequent,  red ones every 10 minutes, the others slightly less so but still very convenient.",August 2020,Edinburgh Bus Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d1866294-Reviews-Edinburgh_Bus_Tours-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Lovely staff but disappointing room,"Needs some work to improve the experience here. Some storage would help, and unsticking the windows would be very easy and would have made it more bearable. Very, very small room. Very challenging conditions for a 4 night stay.  We arrived on the hottest day of  the year to find the windows were all painted shut, and so it was impossible to get any ventilation into the room. The painting had obviously been completed recently, so not only could we not open the windows, the heat and the fresh paint had produced very strong paint fumes which set off my allergies, so I had puffy eyes each morning. 

There was a standard type electric fan in the room, however this was unusable as it made a loud noise like a pneumatic drill so you certainly couldn't have it on for more than a few seconds at a time. To be fair, on the last night we noticed that some sort of cooling had been engaged in the hallway outside so we were able to get some relief by wedging the door open, obviously had to close it overnight though.

There is no storage and there are no flat surfaces in the room, so anything you lay down ends up on the floor.  There is one ""antler type"", hanger on the wall for jackets, and that's all, so we just lived out of a suitcase for 4 nights. 

There was no remote control for the TV, which wasn't working anyway and couldn't be used even manually.

The shower room is tiny, camper van style, so your feet are in the shower when on the toilet, which is diagonal to the door leaving little room to dry yourself when stepping out of the shower. There is however, hot water for showering if you wait 5 minutes for it to run hot.  The hotel is very basic with no restaurant however only a short walk to McDonald's down the road for break fast.   We had what was described as the best room in the hotel. I imagine this is due to the view which is good. There was a good view out over Princes Street and the castle which was the one redeeming feature.

We booked 4 nights here 9 months ago in anticipation of the tatoo which of course was cancelled. I would have felt better about it i think had we not been held to paying twice as much as the room is worth,  (obviously during the tatoo people accept more privations due to the numbers of people staying, but we weren't allowed any leeway ( such as a voucher for the extra cost to use on another occasion, or to change the booking to 2021.

The reception staff were pleasant enough and I don't blame them, they didn't design the hotel after all.

We have stayed in lots of budget hotels so our expectations are managed, however this place is a design nightmare. Not designed for customer experience so much as number of rooms they can cram into limited space with minimum square feet per unit.  If only we could have got some ventilation into the room we would have felt much better.",August 2020,easyHotel Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186525-d1901809-Reviews-EasyHotel_Edinburgh-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",hotels,2.0,3.0
Lovely cafe,"We stopped in as part of our hop on and off bus tour as we were ready for a quick cuppa and bite to eat.
We just had two coffees and a piece of cake but were made to feel really welcome anyway.

Cappuccinos lovely and the millionaires shortbread and chocolate cake with cream excellent.

Lovely place to sit and watch the world go by. Prices very reasonable and during August, Monday to Wednesday of course, even more so!",August 2020,Made in Italy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d1471488-Reviews-Made_in_Italy-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great day out,"We had a day spare, so when we passed by on the tourist bus we decided to look in.

It's a lovely botanic gardens, lots to see and gives a good walk with lots of interest.

My favourite aspects were the wonderful mature trees which will have had a lot of stories to tell and didn't seem to mind too much when I hugged them! Also the wonderful edibles garden with demonstration of the various coppicing and grafting techniques for fruit trees. Lovely examples of brassicas, also courgettes and squashes, I was very jealous! Obviously very hard working gardeners here.

Free entry and a few cafes open. We gave up on the terrace cafe when there was a 50 minute queue and only one poor soul serving. The ice cream booth near the east gate was very good though and we bought soft drinks and ice creams and a cake bar to see us through.  The glass houses weren't open yet which was a shame  but we will have to come back again to see those.",August 2020,Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d189665-Reviews-Royal_Botanic_Garden_Edinburgh-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great early dinner,"We wanted to try this place as it has got a great reputation and we were curious to try it.  We booked an early table at 4.30 which was the only slot available. 

It was well worth it, as the food and service were great! We both had lamb shanks, me with mustard mash and my husband had black pudding mash.

We both had a pint of Stewarts lager with it which went well with the sharpness of the lamb gravy which was tomatoey and a touch of balsamic, I think. The lamb shanks were delicious and the meat fell easily off the bone, obviously had a really lovely slow cook. Our waitress was really friendly, good hygiene pricesses in place, one way system to the toilet, track and trace QR code system easy to use.

Had a lovely meal and would love to come back again soon.",August 2020,Makars Gourmet Mash Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d6481976-Reviews-Makars_Gourmet_Mash_Bar-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Lovely late lunch,"We were looking for a late snack to recover from a days sightseeing and were pleased they were still serving food around 4.00pm. We each had a pint of Innes and Gunn lager and a sharing plate of chicken with extra wings. Served with chips and salad and 2 sauces. The pepper one was a bit fiery but lovely nonetheless and quite moreish! friendly service, hygiene processes all in place. Good Track and trace processes for anyone with a mobile phone.

Delicious and just what we wanted",August 2020,The Albanach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d1891542-Reviews-The_Albanach-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Fantastic dinner,"We visited here during our short break to Edinburgh and were delighted to bag a table as it is obviously very popular. For good reason. The welcome and service was very friendly and efficient, and excellent hygiene processes in place, so we felt very safe.

Food preparation and presentation is excellent, and a great wine selection including by the glass.  We both had the scallops to start which were specials that day, then duck parfait, and risotto for mains. They handled my husband's celery allergy very well, discretely pointing out any dishes to avoid, and making a minor adjustment, swapping out lentils for mash to avoid a trace of celery.  They had managed to make the restaurant virus safe with plastic screens etc, without minimising the lovely intimate feel of the place, so we were able to enjoy an intimate bistro dining experience whilst having plenty of safe space around us. We had a lovely evening here. It will be a high point in our memories of our Edinburgh trip.",August 2020,Cafe St Honore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d719680-Reviews-Cafe_St_Honore-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Needed longer here,"A lovely cathedral with a lot to see and learn. We felt a bit hurried out after 45 minutes as the cathedral closed for cleaning. There is a lovely app to download for a virtual tour of the cathedral with lots of information about aspects of the cathedral, explanations of the stained glass windows etc. I felt that you need a lot of time to get through the virtual tour on the app, but that there is a danger of missing the big picture, ie that this a place of worship. We would have like a small seated section set aside for private prayer so that we could take a few minutes to sit quietly and absorb the atmosphere rather than just looking at the detail of the stained glass, beautiful as it is.

There was some restoration going on ( cherry picker in the middle of the nave), so maybe there were some logistical issues around this.

Nonetheless we enjoyed our visit and found lots of interest here.",August 2020,St Giles' Cathedral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d187655-Reviews-St_Giles_Cathedral-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5
"Nice visit, not all areas open yet","We enjoyed our visit, some of the indoor areas are open and lots of information boards so we learned a lot. The shop was closed so we couldn't buy a guide book which was a shame and the crown jewels weren't accessible today. There were headphones available with audio guide but I always find these a bit insular, so we just downloaded the map. They did have several of the QRCode type downloads of info at points around the castle which contributed to our enjoyment of the day. The indoor sections that we're available are well worth a visit, the great hall, and especially St Margarets chapel are worth some time queuing. Hopefully we will be able to come back again and visit when all areas are open.",August 2020,Edinburgh Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d187653-Reviews-Edinburgh_Castle-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great Scottish food,"We went up to the upstairs restaurant and found there was plenty of room on a Sunday evening. We had haggis neeps and tatties (me), and haggis burger(husband), and both were delicious. A few pints of innes and gun lager and we were very pleased with our meals. Decent prices, and friendly, efficient service. Good distancing hand gel available and felt very safe.",August 2020,Rose Street Brewery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d3625635-Reviews-Rose_Street_Brewery-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
