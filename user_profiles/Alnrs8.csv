The MOST HIGHLY recommended tour guide of Santorini!!!,"This is the company who helped us get know everything about Santorini! Special mention to Elizabeth, who has been very patient, kind, hospitable, sweet and most of all, very down-to-earth person, that made our Santorini holiday a very memorable one! If it was not because of her, our days in Santorini will not be impeccable. She provided history of all the places went to, took us to perfect places for photos, and gave us opportunity to eat traditional homemade local organic greek products and wine tasting! We were very luck to have her as our tour guide! She deserves a 5 stars! Thank you, Elizabeth for everything! And thanks to our driver Spiro as well for patiently driving us around the island!

**If you want to have a fun tour and fulfilling experience while in Santorini, Elizabeth is the right one! She is really fun to be with, and we had a lot of happy moments with her! No dull moments and it is worth every penny! She is indeed credible and you will not regret choosing her as your tour guide!!!!

We never worried about our transfers at all! Antelope travel was very thorough!

When we arrived Athens, Yiannis the driver was very nice to us. He patiently waited for us at the airport even when our flight was slightly delayed. His customer service was superb! He gave us the folder which has everything on it! All the instructions, emergency contact numbers, and all our ferry boat tickets.

Emma, who was our private tour guide in Acropolis was very patient and kind to us as well. She picked us up at the hotel, she explained all the history of Acropolis, and she dropped us off safely back to the hotel. Everyone has been very kind and hospitable to us.

We checked in at 2pm, and we were greeted by the manager named Kostas, who has been so wonderful to us from the first until our last day of our stay. He provided us a warm welcome to the hotel, explained everything about the hotel, our room, and all the amenities! He even gave us a detailed information about Santorini, places to see, and he helped us get a ride if we have to go different places in Santorini. He was very hands on to all the clients’ needs. He provided everything that we needed during our stay. He really provided an EXCELLENT service to us and we really appreciated it from the bottom of our hearts.

The location of the hotel was perfect! We stayed in Avaton Suite, which we can see the perfect view of the Caldera in our balcony while enjoying the jacuzzi. Daily breakfast was included and they will deliver it to your room so you would enjoy eating at the balcony while watching the Caldera view!

The hotel was close to everything as well. And the transportation was easy. Kostas would call a taxi whenever you need it in a decent price at your convenience.

The staff are very nice and hospitable! Especially to Emilius who was also been very kind to us.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and we never regret choosing Avaton Resort and Spa! This is beyond 5 stars! We will never forget this place and we will surely come back in the future.
