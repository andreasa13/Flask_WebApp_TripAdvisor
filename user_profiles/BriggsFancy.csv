"Wonderful, long lasting products","4 years ago I bought the Lip and Body Salve, Five Minute Forecast lotion and a bar of soap. The soap of course is gone. I use the lotion sparingly, because I love it so much. It still has a wonderful scent and feels great. I use the salve on my lips almost daily and there is still plenty.

Trip to Italy,"2nd time to fly BA and we were not disappointed. The Economy Plus service and food was excellent.

Too many delays,"1st flight of the day, we arrived very early, sat in the waiting area for some past scheduled take-off time and were finallly informed there was a maintenance issue and that we would be delayed up to another hour. Now we had a long lay-over in Dallas so it wasn't reallly an issue for us, but many did not have that luxury. Since the plane had been sitting on the tarmac over night why in the world did they not do the maintenance the night before, UNION issues. All thought it was ridiculous. This was only exceeded by the extended delay on our flight out of Dallas. Again we sat in the wiating area long past our scheduled take-off time. Boarded, got all settled and after sitting in the plane for some time we were notified there was an issue with the nose gear and it required that to service it the plane must be empty. We all had to deboard and wait again.

Outstanding tour of Athens and the surrounding area,"We thoroughly enjoyed the tours provided by Private Greece Tours. I visited with Nikos extensively via email prior to our trip and he arranged for us to see and experience everything we were interested in seeing. We had a driver and guide for each day and they were wonderful. They had a vast knowledge of the sites we visited and had great personalities which made our experience even better. George our driver and Katherine our guide on our first day, made our Athens and Sounion Tour outstanding. When they picked us up and we asked what we would be seeing they offered a multitude of suggestions and accommodated us in every way. Down to the BEST Gelato we have ever had. The next day we traveled with Dominic and Georgia was our guide, to see the Temple at Delphi, and again, it was a great day. I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our tours with them and I highly recommend this service. We left feeling like we had made friends with our guides and drivers. They were very sincere and made us feel at home. Private Greece Tours will make your tour of Athens and Greece truly remarkable. I also, highly recommend the option they offer of not only having a knowledgeable driver, but also a guide. The guide can take you into the facilities and offer you a wealth of knowledge you just can't get by reading the signs.

United Disappointment,"Paid extra to sit in Economy Plus. We had used this level last year on British Air and it was excellent. A definite difference from regular Economy, better service, better food, more amenities and much larger and more comfortable seats.

The guides were so informative and taught us so much about the wildlife and the culture of the area. They found several White and Black Rhino for us to observe which made the visit outstanding. I never knew you could stay in a tent and feel like you were at home in your own bed. The hot water bottle in the turned down bed was the cherry on top.",October 2017,Porini Rhino Camp,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g612348-d967116-Reviews-Porini_Rhino_Camp-Nanyuki_Town_Nanyuki_Municipality_Laikipia_County_Rift_Valley_Provinc.html,"Nanyuki Town, Kenya",hotels,5.0,5.0
Porini Mara a totally different experience,"Porini Mara was our third of 4 Porini Camps to visit. I feel like we entered a totally different world from the 1st two camps. The terrain was different, but the excellent service was the same. We were enthusiastically greeted upon arrival and equally so each time we returned to camp from a game drive. If we didn't have a beverage in our hand we were immediately offered one. We never ""wanted"" for anything. Our guides went out of their way to make sure we could see all the wildlife we came to Africa to see. They knew all about the animals and information we didn't know to ask for they shared with us to insure we learned all we could. The excellent food continued at this camp, just like the others. The consistancy of service between the camps is exceptional.",October 2017,Porini Mara Camp,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294209-d614286-Reviews-Porini_Mara_Camp-Maasai_Mara_National_Reserve_Rift_Valley_Province.html,"Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya",hotels,5.0,5.0
Beautiful conservancy,This conservancy is another example of the exceptional efforts being made to conserve the wildlife of Africa and it's habitat. They are working side by side with the Maasai people to sustain the land.
