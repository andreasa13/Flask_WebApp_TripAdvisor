Interesting museum,"The museum had an10 € admission and it is a good price for all the exhibits and excavation.
Well spaced out it had some interesting pieces - for me especially the Catyrids.
We did not eat in the cafe as it did not really have an ambience so I can’t comment on the food.
Overall we really enjoyed it.",September 2020,Skip the Line: Athens New Acropolis Museum Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12835132-Skip_the_Line_Athens_New_Acropolis_Museum_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
Good hotel close to the centre,"A modern hotel with 3 pools and plenty of other facilities.
Due to Covid, restrictions were in place and rightly so.
The breakfast was well managed by the staff and it was plentiful.
I read other reviews that there were queues but my sister and I experienced none.
We chose not to have our room cleaned at all and housekeeping staff were very quick and efficient in bringing us extra toiletries, hangers, towels etc.
We were not aware building works were going on right next door before our arrival. The second pool was closed due to building works. No one was informed. A sign in front of the doors would have been better than just a locked door and confused guests.
The rooftop pool then became seriously overcrowded with no social distancing.
I suggest a handrail on the steps leading from the pool as there is noting to hold onto.
A Massive thank you to Giorgos Savvidis and his team for making my sister’s birthday very special.
A lovely cake, fruit platter and wine were left in our room while we were out surprising her on our return.
Thank you very much!
The staff were helpful and friendly. Would stay again.",September 2020,Grand Hyatt Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15009871-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Historical wonder,"I came here 30 years ago and there was no scaffolding and visitors were allowed nearer to the monuments.
I’m glad to see conservation work is in full flow on this magnificent historical monument and visitors are not allowed too near and strict protocols are in place - which is a good thing.
The Parthenon and the temples on the slopes are truly a wonder and really show an insight into how people lived in the ancient world.
Due to Covid not many tourists were around at 0800 so for the first time ever I got to see this magnificent complex in peace and awe.",September 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A stalwart of Athens,"O Thanasis has been serving delicious affordable food for years.
It’s been 30 years since I was last here and they did not disappoint.
I had the chicken gyros which as usual was delicious. My sister had a tomato and onion salad with bread. The tomatoes were delicious. Finally tomatoes that actually TASTE of tomato! The food is simply delicious.
We had a beer, juice and water.
It came to just over 11 euros.
The staff by the way are amazing.
You’d be crazy not to visit here.",September 2020,O Thanasis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d929471-Reviews-O_Thanasis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Terrible,"This used to be a favourite restaurant of mine and many others but now it’s overpriced and has dire food. The soul has gone.
We waited 50 minutes. No explanation.
No staff were wearing masks. Token bottle of sanitiser on side as you walk in.
The owner we noticed sitting at the Alfred Tennyson pub. Good choice!
I hate this restaurant and I used to love it.
I will NEVER go back.",August 2020,Motcombs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d730163-Reviews-Motcombs-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,4.0
