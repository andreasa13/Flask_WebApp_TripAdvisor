Really good ice cream,The ice cream was really good! It was a really hot day and it was exactly what i was craving. Ignore the resturaunts!

This place is amazing,"I had so much fun here, i love illusions and it was so great to do something different when visiting a city.",August 2019,Athens Museum of Illusions Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d17553562-Athens_Museum_of_Illusions_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
Not coming back,"After staying in a hotel nearby i though this strip of resturaunts would have some decent food. I only tried two of them, but that was enough not to try the others. Being Greek but living in Australia i was excited to try local food from the country my yiayia talked so much about, but i was really disappointed. The food here tasted as though it was reheated, and that's saying something. I expected fresh food expecially from somewhere that talks about traditional food. The staff were friendly at the beginning when getting us into the resturaunt but once inside it was hard to get their attention. Overall not a place i would recommend. Try somewhere else, and definitly ask the people at the door how their food is made up front.",August 2019,Elaea Mezedadiko,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10587843-Reviews-Elaea_Mezedadiko-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Subpar,"Having tasted some of the other places around athens, i was expecting some really great local food. I was suprisingly disappointed with the meal in general. But the staff make up for it with their friendliness.",August 2019,Liondi Traditional Greek Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d5041914-Reviews-Liondi_Traditional_Greek_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
On the expensive side but good food,"The food here was really good, and the view was absolutely amazing! the only downside was the pricing, so as long as you keep that in mind before you go you should have a great experience.",August 2019,Tudor Hall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d695972-Reviews-Tudor_Hall-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Great to visit, try going on a day not that hot",The acropolis is magnificent to see! I would suggest going on a day thats not too hot as the walk up there is steep. Also try not going on a really windy day as even on a calm one its windy at the top. I was lucky :),August 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Amazing history,"There were some really amazing peices here and not only that, it was great to get away from the heat during the summer!",August 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Pushy waiters and terrible food,"Went to have a nice night out in Athens and ended up picking Arcadia. The food looked like it was decent and well priced, but it was a terrible experience.
The waiters were very pushy for you to order more then just a main meal which is really annoying especially when you've been walking around having snacks from different places.
The food was also sub par. We found much better local food in other places surrounding the area.
Overall, i would not recommend visiting here. I would choose one of the other resturaunts.",August 2019,Arcadia Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1501262-Reviews-Arcadia_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
