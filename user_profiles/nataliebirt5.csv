The park and all the facilities and more.
Dog friendly, jumping pillow, pool, playground, river , games room and children's playground.
There are many different cabins to also choose from with powered and non powered sites.
Lots of dog poo bags scattered throughout the park and its big enough for the dogs to be walked.
You can hire fire pits and buy firewood.
The amenities where we were positioned were entry by key , very clean and modern
There is a general large toilet block without key entry.

Won't return,"My partner and I visited here for the first time on the weekend
What appeared a dated exterior, we were surprised to find a modern interior.
Staff were friendly on arrival and we requested to sit out on the lower deck outside, was far too windy for the upper deck
Drinks overpriced so we only had one each
Meal service quick but the chicken Parma was small and the chips had no flavour.
Unfortunately the side salad was bland and not very well presented.
I paid $30 for the calamari and chips which wasn't a disappointment.
Despite the calamari being tender and yes I we won't be returning, overpriced for pub meal",February 2021,Dava Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066994-d5779386-Reviews-Dava_Hotel-Mt_Martha_Mornington_Peninsula_Victoria.html,"Mt Martha, Australia",restaurants,3.0,3.5

Stylish,"Apparently opened for now for 12 months we decided too take my mother inlaw for a country drive, and ended up here.
Despite being the long weekend we got a table.
The decor is tasteful, crisp with many hues of green.
There are 3 areas to the choose from when entering, the main dining area, coffee type lounge and a few tables outside.
The staff are very friendly, all matching attire, they had ran out of almond milk which was disappointing for someone that doesnt drink full cream or soy.
Wine via glass and bottle $$$
Menu was locally sourced, very small dishes and again a little on the pricey side.
Bread was served free with dipping oil, food came quickly and no doubt very tasty.
I admired the concrete flooring, large vases with green and white flowers, high ceilings, well maintained grounds and groves of olive trees made interesting pictures.
The road leading to the grove is gravel for those with prized cars whom cringe of dust and duco chips from small stones.

Never disappoints,"This is the 4th time i have climbed to Mt Oberon.
The climb is a gradual incline with some steps as you ascend to the top.
There are seats on the way if you need a rest and view points to take in the beauty.
On arrival to the top you are welcomed with spectacular views of the ocean, mountains and tidal river campsite.
Its a great place to gather thoights, take time to breathe it all in and take some memorable snaps. It does get windy at the top so hold onto your hats. Suitable for all age groups and fitness levels.
3km one way on average should take an hr to the top.
Good idea to take hat, water amd sunscreen.
Toilets in carpark at the start.

It has 15 rooms over 3 levels with a gorgeous rooftop bar/dining overlooking the Acropolis.
The decor from the moment we stepped inside had the wow factor. Hues of gray white and black filled the corridors and rooms.
Large chandeliers hung from the ceilings with beautiful ceiling roses. We chose a corner balcony suite which was quite spacious with x 3 small balconies opening up to different views of the street.
A gorgeous chime of church bells ring on the hour.
Breakfast was plentiful, not a huge choice but enough for myself and partner.

Nephews birthday,"We decided to celebrate my nephew's birthday party on a Sunday night.
It was quite busy suggesting its a great place to eat.
The younger children enjoyed the playground, I was enjoying the craftsmanship of the rock walls featured throughout the dining area. Large timber beams with quirky lighting are also a grrat talking piece.
Well equipped bar at reasonable prices.
The only disappointed was my meal.
I ordered the calamari which was tasteless and smothered with a mix of two different lettuce and dried noodles.
Other family members appeared happy with theirs.
Waitresses were pleasant , we didnt have to pay for cakeage which was a bonus.
Would recommend for large groups.

Fun day,"We booked the reef sprinter as we both can be prone too sea sickness.
This trip is not only quick but a fun way to arrive to Low Isles.
Both the skipper and crew member were very friendly and informative.
We both felt extremely safe while snorkelling and travelling on the boat.
It was the perfect amount of time on the reef, which with the help of the floatation device made it more enjoyable.
We did look funny in our lycra onsies but it was a bit of piece of mind knowing stingers may be around
Our skipper also took us on a brief tour around Low Isles and showed us points of interest.
Overall very happy choice of tour

Fantastic day,"My partner and I had a fantastic time with our tour guide Jens
This tour showed us life in both the Daintree and Cape Tribulation.
Jens was a very informative and knowledgeable guide who was also both friendly and welcoming.
I liked the diversity of landscape and places visited.
From river cruises, too lookouts, too waterfalls and photo opportunities on the way..
Our last stop was at an ice creamery which was a refreshing experience post rainforest hike.
The catering was abundant and well organised, catering for any dietary requirement.
We loved the refreshing dip in Noahs creek, we didnt have crowds and with a small group we never had too wait for people.
I would highly recommend this tour for anyone wishing to get off the beaten track and experience amazing places and scenery
Well worth the money and early start
Comfortable air con bus

Not my cup of tea,"We decided to catch a cab to the market and realised on arrival it really wasnt the type of market we enjoyed
Rows and rows of food, trinkets, clothes and more trinkets.
It was colourful i will give it that..
We were warned there are pick pocketers at this market and they steal gold jewellery from around marketers neck.

Great day out on the water,"Both myself and partner were time poor when researching best ways to see the Meekong delta
When I saw this tour, it ticked alot of our boxes and more
Communication was fantastic with Les Rives, we secured a spot with less than a weeks notice
Our adventure began with an early morning start at 8am picked up in an air con bus that held around 16 people
We arrived at the dock loaded up in life jackets and set off on a memorable day
Food was offered throught the trip along with refreshments
Staff and the crew were friendly spoke great English and were very informative
Lunch was amazing and plentiful, we got too drink some wine samples too
I loved we meandered through a market, visited both a temple and pargoda and met with a village family and rowed via wooden boats through a canal
Despite it raining at one stage we were supplied with raincoats and traditonal hats to keep us dry
Overall private small group
A little dearer than other tours but worth every cent
Experience life on the delta up close and personal
Highly recommend this mode of transport to see an amazing river",August 2017,Les Rives Authentic River Experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293925-d1746272-Reviews-Les_Rives_Authentic_River_Experience-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,4.5
Mua caves,"Not much to see in the way of caves but we came here to do the ancient 500 steps
My partner and I have a good level of fitness and found these ok to climb
The heat got in our way but stopped a few times to take magnificent pictures snd wipe the sweat away
Would recommend doing this in the earliest part of the day yo avoid the heat
Stunning views
Gardens surrounding peaceful
