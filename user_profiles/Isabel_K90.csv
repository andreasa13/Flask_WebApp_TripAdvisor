Amazing,"I visited the Acropolis with a guided tour from key tours and going up to the Acropolis is a must see if youre staying in Athens.

Its a crowded place but still worth it. The view from up there is amazing and seeing what they created back in the days just blows your mind.

Even in October it was hot, so id recommend to bring a water. If you forget to do so there are vending machines.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

A must see!,I booked a day tour from Athens through getyourguide with key tours. It takes you around 3 hours trip going there and it was really worth my money. Its a bit of a walk but id do it again anytime. The view is amazing and its a very interesting site.

Amazing Hotel,The staff was super friendly and we loved the hotel. The rooftop bar is great and the rooms are spacious and very clean. We booked the pick-up service from the airport and everything worked fine. The food we ordered with room service was tasty too. Restaurants outside the hotel are just within walking distance. Id definitely recommend the hotel.,August 2019,Grand Hyatt Manila,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1758900-d12188172-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Manila-Taguig_City_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,"Luzon, Philippines",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great night out,The group wasn‘t as big as on my previous pub crawls but it was a really great night. The people were nice and our guides were friendly. I enjoyed the first bar. For the roof top and „club“ type of bar I thought they couldve picked other places. Where the music is a bit more up to date. But thats just a personal opinion :),October 2019,The Original Pub Crawl - Athens Drunk Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d15142360-The_Original_Pub_Crawl_Athens_Drunk_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,4.0,4.5
"Beautiful Hotel, just not directly at the beach","The hotel is as great as it looks on the pictures. Clean, very modern with a nice pool. The only thing that is a bit of a disadvantage is that its not directly located at the beach. Its about a 3min walk away.

The staff is very friendly and their bfast is yummy too.

Its definitely a beautiful place to stay at, but personally id book a hotel that is directly situated at the beach.",August 2019,Hue Hotels and Resorts Boracay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294260-d12296845-Reviews-Hue_Hotels_and_Resorts_Boracay-Boracay_Malay_Aklan_Province_Panay_Island_Visayas.html,"Panay Island, Philippines",hotels,3.0,4.5

Good food and beautiful location,"It was our first time at La Mer and we had lunch at Miyabi. I ordered Sushi and the Gyu Don. The food there in general isnt exactly cheap but definitely worth it, since the food is really good. My partner ordered the Bento Deal they have over lunch which is good in price and food. If you‘re there id recommend you to try their lycee ice tea. Its really good especially on a hot summer day, it tastes really refreshing. Ive read reviews about bad service but honestly I didn‘t have a bad experience on that.

Good way to get to your destination,"So I‘ve flown with a lot of different airlines in my life and this was my second time with Oman Air. The first time was from Zurich to Dubai. And this time I went to Abu Dhabi. The flights aren‘t too pricey. The service isn‘t excellent but not bad, so I feel like flying with Oman Air is good, if you wan‘t a decent airlines for a good price. I‘ve experienced better service, but it wasn‘t too bad. The food was ok, as far as airlines food can be considered as good.

Decent Hotel,"My partner and me stayed there for a week. Its a very colorful hotel and a bit a matter of taste wether you like it or not. In my opinion the rooms are a bit too small. You can just tell that its all new, since some things weren’t as perfect yet, compared to other hotels I’ve stayed in in Dubai. The staff is very friendly, but I feel like they should still be a bit more trained in terms of service and English. And for two days we didn’t have any shampoo anymore, meaning we didn’t get a refill. The good thing is the complementary wifi and that there are restaurants around you and a mall. The stores in the mall aren‘t all open yet though. The Spa prices are too high and the food was alright. If I had a choice I wouldn’t return there though and rather stay in the Radisson Blu again.",April 2018,Park Inn by Radisson Dubai Motor City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d12699070-Reviews-Park_Inn_by_Radisson_Dubai_Motor_City-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,3.0,4.5
Good chicken and atmosphere,"I read about this restaurant online and decided to check it out with a friend of mine. The chicken was good and the prices were fair.

You can tell its a new place,"So I went there with my partner for breakfast. The staff was really friendly and the food was good. For the price you pay you should expect a good service though, which unfortunately wasnt the case. We waited over 10 min for our drinks. I ordered an orange juice and a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was served when i almost finished my food. My partner got his food and drinks 10 min ahead from me. Since we were sitting close to the kitchen I observed how they work and felt like it was just all very unorganized.",February 2018,Homestead Restaurant & Bakery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d13506352-Reviews-Homestead_Restaurant_Bakery-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Cute place,"So we went there because we heard, that it was new.

Its all very nicely made and i can recommend stopping over there. The idea with the different food trucks is good and i like the love lock bridge. If you have a love lock bridge though, you should have a vendor or place selling them there. Besides that another minus would be the location. Its in the middle of nowhere.",March 2018,The Yard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d13565948-Reviews-The_Yard-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,4.0,3.5
The food was good,"I read a lot about yume ramen, so i finally decided to go and try their ramen with one of my friends.

We shared the gyoza and ordered the spicy ramen. The food was good but to be honest i expected better. It wasnt as outstanding as i wanted it to be. I read that they make their own ramen noodles, so probably thats why i was so excited to try it. When i finally did, it was probably the noodles that I didnt like that much. I mean dont get me wrong. They are good but comparing to the other ramen resto Mikis, its not as good. In Mikis its the noodles that make the Ramen tastier.

Positive is that yume ramen is close to zurich hb and I like the way they prepare it and how it looks. Id still come back and try their other japanese dishes, since they dont only serve ramen. The staff was friendly and I like how they decorated the restaurant.",October 2017,yume-ramen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188113-d12081267-Reviews-Yume_ramen-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Delicious food / higher price segment,"The restaurant is located in zurich city on the top floor of the swiss casino, which is already a plus since everything is close by.

It was my second time having dinner at george bar & grill and I took my parents with me. For a starter I had the salmon tartar and for the main course I ordered steak and fries. I love how the salmon tartar is not on a regular toast. It gives it a different taste. The meat was also very delicious.

I cant complain about the staff either, they were welcoming and friendly. The only thing I see that could be improved is the time it takes til the food gets served. I remember that we waited quite a while.

If you're looking for a restaurant in the higher price segment with good food, you should definitely put this place on your list.",January 2017,GEORGE BAR & GRILL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188113-d6617445-Reviews-GEORGE_BAR_GRILL-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Beautiful,"We went to zermatt to see the matterhorn and it was really worth the trip. With the swiss travel pass (for tourists) you get a reduction on the cable car.

Overpriced,"It was my first time staying at the Grandeur Hotel and I wasn't that satisfied with my stay.

Its rated as an 4 star hotel, but to me it didnt make up to it. Ive stayed in 4 star hotels in dubai which were definitely nicer in terms of the rooms and had a better service. And it was overpriced to what it offered.

We used the laundry service and then half of our laundry only got returned. When I called to ask about it they told me they will check. Anyways that didnt happen and I had to make 3 calls following up on my laundry til they finally found the rest.

The only positive thing is that its close to mall of emirates if you want to go shopping there, but if I had the choice id probably pick another hotel when revisiting.",April 2017,Grandeur Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d1200707-Reviews-Grandeur_Hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,2.0,4.0
Good way to go around,"If you dont get out the bus the tour takes 2hrs. It takes you to all important places in boston and I thought it was a good way to get around.

Decent Room and good location,"I stayed at the Boston Park Plaza for 3 nights and payed 200 dollars per night.
The staff at the reception was very friendly and actually upgraded my room.

All in all my stay was ok. Theres nothing specific that I would say was really bad or horrible. I was just a bit disappointed because I had expected more. The lobby looks nice so I thought that the rooms were bigger or a bit more special considering its price. But to sum it up the room was decent.

A plus to the hotel is the location. its close to the T station Arlington and its very easy to go around if you're staying there.",June 2017,Boston Park Plaza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60745-d111418-Reviews-Boston_Park_Plaza-Boston_Massachusetts.html,"Boston, Massachusetts",hotels,3.0,4.0
Thumbs up to the IMAX,"I went to the IMAX to watch Amazon 3D. I liked the movies itself but wasn't too taken by the movie itsself, but I guess everyone has their own taste when it comes to that. I wouldve probably enjoyed more picking another movie.

Not pricey and good quality,"I found this restaurant on google and was surprised on how you can get good burgers for not that much money.

The quality of the burger was good. Maybe not the best in town but Id revisit another time. I had fries, a burger and a drink and only payed around 20 swiss francs. The price is good since I dont know any other burger place that offers such a good price for a menue with a quality like that.

The venue is small and hipster, which is nice too. All in all thumbs up!",June 2017,B.Good Langstrasse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188113-d8704723-Reviews-B_Good_Langstrasse-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Great Pinoy food,"I was staying in Boston and felt like eating filipino food so I googled for filipino restaurants and found this.

I was a bit worried since my friends have told me that a lot of filipino restaurants have been americanized, just as some asian restaurants in europe weren't that good anymore. But I must say this place didn't let me down.

I ordered their lechon kawali and lumpia. Both tasted really good. Since I am half filipina i can judge :). The price was really decent, it cost me only 14 dollars and that was including the rice and a drink.

Its a very simple restaurant which I don't mind as long as a the food is good, which as mentioned was the case.",June 2017,JnJ Turo Turo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60710-d1757367-Reviews-JnJ_Turo_Turo-Quincy_Massachusetts.html,"Quincy, Massachusetts",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Impressing ""sight""","I found this place through tripadvisor and thought it was impressing and its definitely worth a stop.

The entrance fee is only 6 dollars which I thought was ok.

The only thing I thought was a bit of a pity is that you're not allowed to take pictures.

Tasty Pho,"My friend showed me this restaurant and we had a great dinner there.

Since its a small restaurant, we had to wait around 15min for a free table. It was worth the wait though.

As probably read in the title I ordered a pho. It tasted super good compared the phos ive had here in switzerland.

The portion was just way too big for me or is big in general. So after trying to eat as much as possible, I felt sick. So if you stop at this place make sure to ask about the size of the pho bowl.",June 2017,Pho Basil,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60745-d1228651-Reviews-Pho_Basil-Boston_Massachusetts.html,"Boston, Massachusetts",restaurants,4.0,4.5
It was delicious,"I met two of my former coworkers and we spontaneously decided to eat there. I ordered the galloway brie burger and it tasted good. Before ive only been there for a drink and i was surprised that the food was good, since im always a bit sceptical towards burger restos. The only thing that i probably didnt like was the basket. In my opinion its a bit too small for the portion of food you get and it makes it harder to eat. Or maybe its just me that likes a bigger plate.

I wouldnt say it was the best burger in town but it was pretty close and i would say it can keep up with all the other burger places there are now in zurich.

Good meat and good price,"I randomly picked this restaurant for a dinner with my SO and i definitely didnt regret going. We both enjoyed the food there a lot.

I love their all you can eat concept. They come to your table with like a sword where the meat is on and everytime they stop by with a different type of meat. After a while though, like with all you can eat places i couldnt see any meat anymore but that didnt have anything to do with the quality of the food though. And if you need a meat break theres a piece of paper that signalises them to not stop by at your table.

I would say for what you get the price is fair. It didnt taste like a cheap meat and you had a great variety they served you.

And ive read comments here saying the garlic mashed potatoes, that come as a side to the meat, werent that tasty. I mean speaking as an european i would say it doesnt taste like back home but i actually found it delicious.

After all the meat, one of my highlights was the baked banana dessert they give you.

The other sides you could get at the buffet werent that special but it was good for the price. If youre visiting dubai and you are a meatlover, you should visit this place. It is quite a food experience.",April 2017,Texas de Brazil,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d8684379-Reviews-Texas_de_Brazil-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great balinese food,"For people that are looking for a simple but good traditional balinese restaurant its a great place.

Delicious food for a good price,"It was quite a trip getting to the restaurant but my partner and me thought it was 100% worth it!

The steak i ordered was really delicious and you could tell it was ""good quality"" by its taste. To drink we ordered a type of tea they make which was very fresh and good, unfortunately I cant recall its name.

Great stay!,"We stayed at the hotel for 6 days and we were quite happy with what we got for its price. The room was nice, very modern and clean and you get plenty of complimentary bottles of water. They should really work on their cleaning staff. Besides the first two days there was always something missing with filling up, like one day they didnt give us any new towels. Plus i feel they didnt clean the room that well, just not on the level I know from other hotels.

The staff was very friendly and they really put work into it to make us feel comfortable. Breakfast buffet was ok, not that special though. I dont recommend the tiramisu they have on their card. Not a tiramisu at all, its more like a pudding.

All in all our stay was great though. I just feel the hotel needs to improve little things which I believe can still be done, since opening was just recently.",August 2016,Jimbaran Bay Beach Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3561989-d10325154-Reviews-Jimbaran_Bay_Beach_Resort_Spa-Kedonganan_Jimbaran_South_Kuta_Bali.html,"Kedonganan, Indonesia",hotels,4.0,4.0

It doesnt have too many tables which makes it more special and exclusive. The ambiente was very chill and relaxed and the restaurant has its own charm.

The food was really good, we got a small Appetizer served from the restaurant additional to the ordered appetizers. Plus before we ordered the chef gave us an info on the daily special. The staff is very friendly and service oriented.

Like ive travelled with other Airlines before and I feel like they lack that extra class that other bring to the table. Then what I thought wasn't good, is that they don't give you seats next to each other even if you booked together. I know that sometimes it can occur but there were severals passengers Standing in the aisle askin to Switch so they could sit with their Familys. Plus I feel like they should update their planes.

The legroom isnt that big, you sit quite tight. One Thing they could Change is that the staff should learn better english or on how to speak with customers.

A minus was that I had to wait quite a while probably 40min til the main dish was served and I was in a rush to head out. I kind of expected it to be faster since its already a lunch menue.

Plus they have the menue in different languages which is definetely a plus. But not only for tourists its a great spot. The Schweinshaxen is a must try or their Züri Geschnetzeltes is really good too. Even locals eat here because the food is tasty. I recommend to reserve a table since its always packed.,March 2016,Restaurant Zeughauskeller,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188113-d697919-Reviews-Restaurant_Zeughauskeller-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Beautiful but expensive,"I was really excited going to the aquarium since it looked really nice already from the outside. Even more thrilled was I when i read about the different encounters you can have & we picked the king croc encounter which i regreted afterwards. we could go inside and watch from the top how they feed the crocs. i just feel the encounter they offer wasnt that special especially since it wasnt exactly cheap. We couldve seen the feeding from the outside, it wouldnt have made a big difference. In the encounter included was feeding the birds that were inside which wasnt that special either. I couldve done that in any other country. I just felt like its totally overpriced for what you get. The staff giving us the info was friendly though.",March 2016,Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d1792285-Reviews-Dubai_Aquarium_Underwater_Zoo-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,3.0,4.0
Tasty chicken,"The chicken there is good and not to greasy. Portion could be bigger but you cant really complain since the prices are good. A big plus is that the drinks are refillable. Several restaurants have tried their luck at this location but I must say chickeria is the best so far. I love it, thumbs up!",January 2016,Chickeria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188113-d9604407-Reviews-Chickeria-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Decent Hotel in Dubai Deira,"The Hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. Negative aspect would be that the bathroom isnt quite that practical since the ""curtain"" is only in the front and everything gets wet once you take a shower. For guests that want a bit more of a quite place to stay i would say this isnt the place to stay. You can hear the Music from upstairs in your room. Personally it didnt bother me but i know some guests would mind. I liked the bar, it was a nice ambiete. Just a Drinks are a bit pricey.",February 2016,Grand Excelsior Hotel Deira,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d304492-Reviews-Grand_Excelsior_Hotel_Deira-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,4.0
Touristic Restaurant,"Good Service but only ok Food. For me its one of those Restaurants thats for typical tourists that dont really know how good swiss cuisine can be. The Fondue was ok, but ive had far better. There are other swiss Restaurants where a lot of tourists go that are really good.",March 2015,Restaurant Swiss Chuchi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188113-d799636-Reviews-Restaurant_Swiss_Chuchi-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Different experience,"In my opinion theres way too less restaurants like this. Not saying all should be in the dark, but an experience. It was a bit a weird feeling being in the dark at first, but the food was great. The waitress was really friendly and doing a good job too. My friends who are from the states and were visiting zurich, said that eating there was their best so far. The only thing id advise is to reserve ahead since its always booked.",February 2015,blindekuh Zürich,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188113-d779632-Reviews-Blindekuh_Zurich-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice Hotel,"The Hotel was beautiful, but the Prices are Kind of high. I dont really know if its Manhatten in General. Its just if you pay such an amout of Money for a Hotel. Expectations are higher and it wasnt like it blew me away. And its a minus that the WIFI isnt complementary. Nowadays in high class Hotels it usually is.",November 2015,New York Marriott Marquis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d93507-Reviews-New_York_Marriott_Marquis-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,4.0,4.0
Disappointing,"I had dinner with my family there since it was my parents wedding anniversary and we were disappointed. Since its an expensive restaurant, expectations are high of course. The food was good, but it didnt blow us away, looking at the fact that the menu didnt offer many different choices.

I would say a big minus was the service. Considering the fact that it is a fine dining restaurant , I feel like they should train their waiters better on how to interact better with customers. For example after finishing with the food the waitress wanted to clean the table and my mom had her hand on it and while she was cleaning she just picked up her hand and put it to the side. I mean we didnt complain about it since it wasnt that bad. What im trying to say is, that its a big no go to me. In a restaurant like this things like that shouldnt happen.

The feeling of seeing the walls move was another aspect we didnt enjoy that much - but i have to say, everyone feels different about that.",November 2015,The View Restaurant & Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d665237-Reviews-The_View_Restaurant_Lounge-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Best Burger Restaurant in Town,"Ive been to a couple of burger places in Zurich and out of all this is the best one up to now. The only thing to improve in my eyes is the reservation line. I find it a bit tiring actually getting a table there, since you can only call in a specific time window which is not that big compared to other places. Other than that I love the food, the atmosphere and how they serve the burger. Different than other Burger Restaurant.",June 2015,The Bite,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188113-d4703697-Reviews-The_Bite-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",restaurants,5.0,4.0

It was quite good but i still had better,"I enjoyed the american food and loved the fact they had mac n cheese on their menu. Generally they have great choices that you wouldnt find in other american restaurants in Zurich.

The Pulled Pork i had there was tasty but still I wouldnt say its the best I had in Zurich. I find it great that the waiters actually speak good english unlike some other american restaurants. Big Plus.
