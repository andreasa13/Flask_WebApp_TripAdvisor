Like they don't care,"This place has been a blemish on the Mountain Mike's Franchise for at least twenty years. The first time I went I was disappointed twenty years ago, thought this weekend I would give it another try. The pizza was OK, but not up to the usual Mt Mike's quality and service was kind of surly. even just for pick up. I will never go to this location again as there is so much better pizza for the same or lower prices in Morgan Hill, including a new Mountain Mikes at Dunne and Condit where Hang Ten used to be.",May 2020,Mountain Mike's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32744-d4946585-Reviews-Mountain_Mike_s-Morgan_Hill_California.html,"Morgan Hill, California",restaurants,2.0,2.5
Fairly standard for Chinese,"The walnut prawns were mediocre, the shrimp was not fresh, nor was it crispy fried. The honey sauce was stock. The fried rice was a bit dry, and my chicken skewers had lots of sauce, but the sauce, (a variation of teriyaki) was ok. This is not a bad restaurant, but there are better Chinese in town.",May 2020,Pearl River Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32744-d15171236-Reviews-Pearl_River_Restaurant-Morgan_Hill_California.html,"Morgan Hill, California",restaurants,3.0,3.0

Expected less but got more,"I was not sure this would be good due to only one review and a limited menu due to COVID-19. I ordered the gen Tso’s chicken lunch special. The egg roll was fresh and not too greasy as they can get. The pork fried rice was quite good, the chicken chow menu was also good and not too greasy. The gen Tso’s chicken was grilled and the sauce was perfect. I was not expecting this level of quality. I recommend this place",May 2020,Golden China Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32744-d4727282-Reviews-Golden_China_Restaurant-Morgan_Hill_California.html,"Morgan Hill, California",restaurants,4.0,4.0
As Denny’s go meh,I had the bourbon bacon burger with wavy fries and a vanilla shake. I have gotten this same dish at other Denny’s and they were better.

Top of the field,"The Family and I went here last summer and we were loving it. Some very impressive birds, but check the website for what is happening there.

Standard for Little ceasars,"So I know they don't have the highest quality of ingredients, but they have stuffed crust and they are the bomb when it comes to pizza technology and ease of order/pickup.

Like coming home,The friendliness with which I was greeted was so warm. The waiter was so cool and helpful. I had to try the mole enchiladas and it was superb the spices and flavors well balanced. And for the heck of it I got a crispy taco because my waiter waxed poetic about the crispy tacos. The carnitas was scrumptious.
