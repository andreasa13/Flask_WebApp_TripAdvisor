Great family fun,"Really enjoyed touring this ship. The self guided tours were appropriate, however I felt that a greater amount of attention could have been captured in some of the exhibits. The chapel did an awesome job of grabbing and holding us, but some of the others missed out. Loved the flight deck, but the tour was lacking there.

High price for good food,"The prices reflect the high opinion of this restaurant. The food was good. The cinnamon role was huge and very tasty.

"Missed my expectations, but still decent","Too often, we have come to expect larger quantities of food when we order, and because of this Able's missed the mark, as Able's Diner provides smaller portions than the norm. The club had just a slice or two of each component (meat, tomato, lettuce, bacon). The chicken fried steak was smaller than the plate. The fruit was contained within the cup.

However... Everything had a good taste, especially the beef soup, so if you are not feeding an army of teenagers, or are looking to control your portions Able's is a good stop.",March 2020,Abel's Diner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56639-d437313-Reviews-Abel_s_Diner-Schertz_Texas.html,"Schertz, Texas",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Worth a visit,"In town for the weekend and need to refuel, so we stopped here on a recommendation from the hotel staff. So much food and so many options!

Delicious!,"Stopped in to refuel after a local race event, and this BBQ did not disappoint! The pork belly burnt ends were crisp, yet tender. The regular sausage had an excellent flavor.

Disappointed,"The place was dead at lunch, which should have been a clue. Had the grilled chicken sandwich. Bacon was burned. Chicken was dry and overcooked.

Extremely disappointed!,"The hotel concierge recommended this place for something different, and it could have been great. They were out of krautwurst, but they replaced it with a pretzel, which was overly dry. The waitress recommended the chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun, which was also a bit overcooked, but had good flavor. All of that could have been over looked as it was a beautiful evening, with patio seating and live music, except... for an establishment that posts no smoking signs on the patio, but then allows patrons to smoke, and even provides them ash trays. This too could have been easily resolved, but my waitress blamed it on the other waitress, and every single employee walked by the couple without saying a single word to them as they chain smoked.

"Slow service, decent food","First thing we noticed on our visit was how slow everyone moved. From being seated in a nearly empty restaurant, to the waiter, to the food, to the check. The food was decent, with the tomato spaghetti soup, the bean and salsa dips, and thick tortilla chips as appetizers. The carne asada tacos were pretty basic though.

Excellent flavor,"First of all, everything had excellent flavor and tasted great. However this place falls short in the knowledge of the service staff. My waiter had no answers for about half my questions regarding the food. For the price, I also expected more food. The pork cutlets were basically breakfast chops beaten to 1/8 inch thick, then overbreaded to make them look thick! The sashimi was very tiny, with each serving of three pieces equating to what is typically one sushi piece at other restaurants. The dessert was a nice touch, with a small fruit, chocolate, and strawberries. Just enough sweetness at the end. Great tastes all around, but the price at nearly $30 for one person, makes this place a onetime visit.",January 2019,Kenzo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1772147-d10736922-Reviews-Kenzo-Murphy_Texas.html,"Murphy, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.0

The Asian chicken wraps were plentiful on the veggies, but the sauced chicken had an odd flavor that did not mesh with the hoisin sauce on the side.

First of all, at 7pm, half the tables in the place had dirty dishes still on them, with the staff cleaning 'just in time' for the next customer to sit down. The service was extremely slow, with the wrong drinks brought out initially. I had to call out to the waitress each time I needed something as she just ignored our table and never checked on us. The plates were scorching hot, but the food was not. The enchilada 'chile con carne' was more like tomato soup with bits of meat in it. The rice and beans were typical.

Not up to par,"Met some friends here who recommended this place on a Saturday night. It was overcrowded and noisy to start off with some crazy stomping up stairs. Once we were seated, the service was slow and the waiter kept making mistakes, forgetting what we asked for, and delivering the food wrong. The bread was crusty enough to break a tooth. The pork chop was ""flame kissed"" which appears to mean overdone as it was dry as card board. The first loaded baked potatoe was truly loaded, including with what I asked them to take off, but the second potatoe was barely garnished.

The three pieces of cannoli were very crunchy with a tasty whipped filling, that hit that sweet spot!",August 2018,Amoretto Italian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56463-d14911622-Reviews-Amoretto_Italian_Restaurant-Plano_Texas.html,"Plano, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Pricey but good,"The chicken wraps are very tasty, providing a nice twist to the local area. The fries are typical, but the quantity is not. On each of my visits, I thought I must have received two potatoes worth of fries! The desserts are a little disappointing and need improvement.",August 2018,Board Bites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56463-d13919028-Reviews-Board_Bites-Plano_Texas.html,"Plano, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Fantastic restaurant,"We were seated fairly quickly on a Friday evening by a hostess with a big smile. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable, with excellent suggestions to our questions. The food was great. The butcher plate was filling. The brat burger was different but tasty. The pork chops were perfect! The austrian potato salad surprised me being cold, but had excellent flavor. The cucumber salad could have used considerably less dressing though.",August 2018,Jorg's Cafe Vienna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56463-d670695-Reviews-Jorg_s_Cafe_Vienna-Plano_Texas.html,"Plano, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.5
It is FroYo!,"Good selection of frozen yogurt and candies for toppings. Clean store and friendly, helpful staff. Great place to stop on a hot day and sit outside with a treat.",August 2018,Orange Leaf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56922-d7035060-Reviews-Orange_Leaf-Wylie_Texas.html,"Wylie, Texas",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Decent tacos,"This is another taco place in a long list of specialty taco places. There is considerable meat to each taco, making them very filling, but the tacos are nothing special, for the price you pay. Shredded chicken is a bit wet. The beef is a little dry. The pork was flavorful. The potato mash is an interesting twist to a taco. Friendly staff.",August 2018,Loco Gringo Taco Shack,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56922-d13657018-Reviews-Loco_Gringo_Taco_Shack-Wylie_Texas.html,"Wylie, Texas",restaurants,3.0,4.5
"Barely acceptable for a ""Philly""","While the size of the sandwich was good, on both the regular and the large, and the quantity of steak was excellent, there were a few issues. Three items were incorrect, spicy instead of regular fries, onions were asked to be removed, and no cheese on a ""plain"". More seasoning of the meat would have been great. Plenty of options for sauces, at the table and in the side cooler. Excellent customer service as well.",August 2018,Big Tony's West Philly Cheesesteak,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56463-d13402782-Reviews-Big_Tony_s_West_Philly_Cheesesteak-Plano_Texas.html,"Plano, Texas",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Great hole in the wall,"Some excellent Mexican street style tacos in this tiny joint. It was packed for dinner on a Wed night, with a continuous flow of people coming through. The tacos were delicious, loaded with flavor and a good quantity of meat. The side carrots were an interesting addition, but tasty.",July 2018,La Juanita,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g38400-d2258061-Reviews-La_Juanita-Sioux_City_Iowa.html,"Sioux City, Iowa",restaurants,4.0,4.5
