Room to stay,"The area is great in between locations of Monstirki and Syntagma. Unfortunately the Hotel needs updating. You can walk around to cafes and restaurants it’s very safe.

The food is great they have a variety of food to choose from. Try the refreshing (fruit) drinks non alcoholic or you may enjoy a drink from the bar. The atmosphere changes at night the lights are on, it looks amazing inside and out, always buzzing . Yes it's children friendly but as I said night time it's different. It's a bar inside so don't bring children or babies they do have music playing. (Your choice) The different experience of this place, outside, inside day and night.

Two day stay Cecil Hotel,"Well not bad location very short distance to Monastiraki Flea market. Couldn’t move out to the balcony the air cons fan was on there. Loved the big doors front entrance and to the rooms and balcony, it has a great stair case all the way up and great old style lift. Loved that! The room was very tiny two single beds a small dresser and no mini fridge in the room it was outside and shared. The room very small to fit everything in there. Bathroom shower head holder was broken so you had to hold it with one hand and shampoo your hair with the other if you wanted continues water running. ( shower holder like a telephone shower head), well the light fitting I thought was going to fall during the night it was just hung on! I can say they had a big cupboard with an extra pillow and blanket and a very small television. Maybe these little things should be looked at before hiring the room out. No bin only in the bathroom. The bathroom was very small couldn’t completely open the door because of the sink. Very badly designed. If a larger person was in this room they would be very frustrated because they would not be able to fit, let alone move around in there. (Tight for us) Terrible.",July 2019,Cecil Hotel Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d233053-Reviews-Cecil_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,3.5
Day out in Acropolis Museum,"Great museum, it was amazing to see, clean and bright place. Down stairs was amazing to see the underground ruins. In between the floors they have see through glass that you can see between the floors, so I recommend that ladies wear no skirts or dresses. Amazing ruins just awesome to see and experience what was then. Upstairs is a cafe and undercover outside with the amazing views of the Acropolis. It’s amazing, breathtaking. It’s 10.00 euro to enter you can go online to book and groups are welcomed as well. Staff are friendly and speak English. You may also have a tour guid to take you inside and around the grounds.
I would go again with my family loved every bit of it.",July 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Yogurt treat,"Unfortunately the females that work there are very rude. They spoke in Greek and made very rude remarks huffed and puffed for me to hurry up and pay because there was a lady waiting behind me. Well they both made a remark in Greek so I wouldn’t understand, well shame on them cause I do understand everything they said. Maybe they should pay attention to their job and less on customers on what they wear and whom they are with. Saying very rude comments which I couldn’t hold it any more. So I told them off and told them to shut their mouths and have respect for who comes here. Maybe they learnt something I don’t know. Don’t let them pour your yogurt in the cup, do it your self you pay it by weight and adding the sweets on top will cost you over $10 euros.",July 2019,Louyo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d8120519-Reviews-Louyo-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,1.0,3.5

Breakfast after long walk,"Well deserved breakfast at 12pm midday after a long walk in the heat. Ordered 2 eggs bacon and a toasted sandwich with cheese and a frappe. Well, my eggs needed a bit more cooking and bacon not bad could of had more bacon but my toast was terrible it had a black long hair in it, that stopped me from continuing my meal. I guess I'm writing this is because when your in the kitchen for yourself or for others you want the best cooked food and the best experience for your customers to come back for more. In the kitchen,, long hair wear it back, tie it up wear a net. I would always make sure when I'm in the kitchen I tie my hair back it's the first thing you do when your going to cook something and you defiantly learn in the hospitality industry. I will say it's a great location across from the beach and undercover seating nice surroundings maybe they can improve from this experience or have a chief and not the owner or just anyone cooking. Pay for a professional to cook. You can't do everything cook and deal with money.",September 2018,Akroyali Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g5484758-d15214712-Reviews-Akroyali_Restaurant-Agios_Andreas_Messenia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Agios Andreas, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5

Presentation there was none. I didn't even know that was my octopus. Didn't enjoy it. My main was lamb shanks with mashed potatoes- huge plate which had two drumstick pieces which was nice, the meat would come off the bone nicely but didn't like that the plate was full of red sauce and my mash potatoes underneath the meat.
