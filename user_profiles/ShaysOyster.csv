Tourist trap,Very Disney like with no culture. The old town seemed quite artificial and Very overpriced. Unless your obsessed with GOT then I can’t think of a justifiable reason to visit the old. Good points are it’s easy to navigate around and clean,August 2019,Dubrovnik Old Town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295371-d17541785-Reviews-Dubrovnik_Old_Town-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",attractions,3.0,4.5
Unreal natural views,"Really enjoyed my time here. You can hire a Canoe for €3 and paddle around, beautiful waterfalls very green and refreshing. Strongly recommend visiting here either to relax or wonder around the park. Picture perfect location",August 2019,Mostar and Kravice Waterfalls Small-Group with Turkish House Included,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g295371-d11992443-Mostar_and_Kravice_Waterfalls_Small_Group_with_Turkish_House_Included-Dubrovnik_Du.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",activities,5.0,4.5
Artificial attraction,Tourist trap! From attending a local walking tour I was told it was artificial and i “think” they also mention it isn’t located where the initial checkpoint was. Give it a miss you will be very underwhelmed,September 2019,Checkpoint Charlie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d1166028-Reviews-Checkpoint_Charlie-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,1.0,3.5
Open to interpretation,The memorial is some sort of maze type accumulation of large cubes. Why this was designed for a memorial I’m not entirely sure I guess it’s open for interpretation. It’s cool to get lost within it,September 2019,The Holocaust Memorial - Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d617423-Reviews-The_Holocaust_Memorial_Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,3.0,4.5
"It gets very hot inside during summer, book an evening tour!",The government building is a great symbol of old & new Berlin as you will see from the architecture. During summer it can be very hot so I would recommend booking your visiting time in the evening. Inside has amazing decor and the views from the top are unreal. Don’t forget to bring your I.d when reserving.,September 2019,Reichstag Building,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d190517-Reviews-Reichstag_Building-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,5.0,4.5
Unfortunately not enough attendees,Unfortunately not enough attendees during our pub crawl however the staff took the few that did turn up to 2-3 bars and then left us to our own devices but with helpful suggestions,March 2019,Vilnius Pub Crawl,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g274951-d15359151-Vilnius_Pub_Crawl-Vilnius_Vilnius_County.html,"Vilnius, Lithuania",activities,3.0,5.0
"Cool concept, Go get your stamp!","I really like the whole idea of Uzupis and how hip and quirky it is, very unique and very small place within Vilnius and a great way to get a very rare unique Passport stamp. In and around the vicinity there is plenty of random art and is ooozing with creativity and culture",March 2019,Republic of Uzupis Information Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274951-d13993983-Reviews-Republic_of_Uzupis_Information_Centre-Vilnius_Vilnius_County.html,"Vilnius, Lithuania",attractions,4.0,4.5
Definitely worth a visit,When in Vilnius the KGB museum is a must in order to absorb some of the cities historical culture. Fairly small in comparison to the nazi house of terror in Budapest and Auschwitz however entry its very cheap and luckily for me it was free entry due to a technical issue with tickets. Very educational and with a little imagination you can almost imagine how horrific it must have been when active.,March 2019,Skip the Line: KGB Museum of Occupation and Freedom Fights Entrance Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g274951-d14954864-Skip_the_Line_KGB_Museum_of_Occupation_and_Freedom_Fights_Entrance_Ticket-Vilnius_.html,"Vilnius, Lithuania",activities,5.0,4.5
Decent and a must do while in Athens,"My visit to the acropolis was quite underwhelming to be honest, you had to use more of your imagination to appreciate where you were as at the moment (December 2019) it was mostly a building site however the views of the city are unreal from up there. I suppose with most historical monuments it’s hard to be awed anymore due to seeing the images online.",December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Quality scenes and Value for money,"Cool UFO designed building with high quality decor and excellent service. I had a five course meal of quality food which was artistically presented with a smile. The quality of food and service is great especially for such affordable and fair prices, if this restaurant was in London or Paris you would have paid 5 times the amount.",March 2019,UFO Reštaurácia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274924-d697355-Reviews-UFO_Restauracia-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Never again,I’m a Big fan of Tesla however to go in the museum you can’t buy tickets in advance or at the museum and return which resulted in me have to wait outside an for a hour in the scorching sun with no shade in side and to be told if stand in shade(out of the vaccinity) you will lose your place as it’s first come first serve (30 people per tour) it’s more aimed at kids and very small and underwhelming and doesn’t do justice for such an iconic Pioneer!,August 2019,Nikola Tesla Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g15019626-d1584393-Reviews-Nikola_Tesla_Museum-Vracar_Belgrade.html,"Vracar, Serbia",attractions,1.0,4.0
Lit!,"If your wanting the whole party Ibiza experience then Ibiza rocks is more than ideal, stayed there twice in the past 3 years and would happily stay there again. Plenty of amenities/events/mini mart/gym and good location",August 2019,Ibiza Rocks Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g652116-d291148-Reviews-Ibiza_Rocks_Hotel-Sant_Antoni_de_Portmany_Ibiza_Balearic_Islands.html,"Ibiza, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.0
Georgia was unreal,"I arrived in Berlin 2 hours prior to the tour tired and exhausted but fortunately my Guide was Georgia who was very educational and captivating and I soon forgot how tired I was. I have been on many city tours across Europe this was Definitely the best, some tours I have attended it seems like a checklist where they reel off facts but Georgia was captivating and you could almost imagine being there. She is an extremely talented story teller who I can imagine in theatre of some sort. Highly recommend",August 2019,3-Hour East Berlin Walking Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187323-d12556532-3_Hour_East_Berlin_Walking_Tour-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",activities,5.0,5.0
