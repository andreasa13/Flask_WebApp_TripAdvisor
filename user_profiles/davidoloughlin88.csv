The scale is incredible,This museum has an outstanding history and is truly a sight to see. Pay the fee to enter whether or not you decide on the guided tour.,January 2020,Hagia Sophia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293974-d294497-Reviews-Hagia_Sophia-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",attractions,5.0,4.5

Excellent Food a bit off the Beaten Path,"The food here was excellent, probably some of the best we had during our stay. Service was fast as the place was not full. Eating dinner before 8 in Istanbul is early for them.",January 2020,Arch Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d8051522-Reviews-Arch_Bistro-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Winter visit left the site nearly empty,We visited in January 2020 and entered the site at opening. We were able to get in and visit the site with fewer than 20 people for the first hour. Nothing beats the sun rising over the city as seen from the Acropolis. I would recommend visiting the museum for a full understanding of the importance and history prior to visiting the Acropolis.,January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Jungle Expedition with Rafting and Zip Lining,"We were recommended this tour by a friend who went the year prior. We could not asked for a better experience. Our guides, Alex 1 and Alex 2 were simply great. Alex 1 was the lead guide and you could tell he was fully invested in getting our group the absolute best experience. He answered all our questions thoroughly and with a great deal of passion; clearly someone who loves what they do. The jungle trek has a great mix of activities. With plenty of breaks, the trek takes you though the mountains without wiping you out for the next day. We had a blast doing the rafting. The zip lining was okay but I ended up almost breaking my foot. More on that towards the end. I would 100% recommend booking this trek even with some minor issues with the zip lining company. Perhaps miss the zip lining, but do not miss out on the experience that Lorenzo offers.

The company running the zip line is a third party and they are not run as well as Lorenzo. The trees were allowed to grow up under the zip line too high. The workers sending the participants down the line would sometimes spin us to make it more exciting. This is how I ended up clipping a tree with my foot.",July 2019,Lorenzo Expeditions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294314-d2461862-Reviews-Lorenzo_Expeditions-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html,"Cusco, Peru",attractions,5.0,5.0
Awesome experience,We went in late January 2020. The whole experience was great. Be ready to sweat going into the hot room! The heat was the perfect setup to the bubble massage. Yahya was my masseuse and he did a great job. It might have been our group's favorite part of the trip.,January 2020,Cagaloglu Hamami,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293974-d524121-Reviews-Cagaloglu_Hamami-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",attractions,5.0,5.0
A bit off the main path but we’ll worth it.,"These guys have great food and a wide menu to serve most any pallet. I had their Ethiopian style Camel Nibs and enjoyed every bite. It’s a short walk from the palace and dollar for dollar, a great find.",July 2018,Melting Pot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293787-d1632887-Reviews-Melting_Pot-Djibouti.html,"Djibouti, Djibouti",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Best Staff in the City,"I’m 7 days into a 2 week stay in this hotel. The location gives a nice view of the sea and the ships coming into port and relaxing cool sea breezes. The hotel is impeccably decorated and beautiful to walk through but the staff is what really sells this hotel. The staff have gone above and beyond to accommodate myself and my colleagues. Whether it’s the wonderful people providing room service/cleaning, or Libon manning the pool bar; every staff member has been eager to help make us as comfortable as possible.
If you are heading to Djibouti, this is the place to stay. The staff will make sure you are having the best experience possible.",July 2018,Djibouti Palace Kempinski,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293787-d630352-Reviews-Djibouti_Palace_Kempinski-Djibouti.html,"Djibouti, Djibouti",hotels,5.0,4.0
Eerily beautiful landscape,"Well worth the 1.5 hr drive from Djibouti City. You will drive through areas that look more lunar or Martian than anything you’ve seen on earth. It is such a bizarre landscape. We saw many camel, donkeys, wild goats and either 3 dik dik or impalas, not sure which. Supposedly there’s a village we drove through that you can see baboons but we must have missed them. Either way, 5/5.",July 2018,Lake Assal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293787-d311338-Reviews-Lake_Assal-Djibouti.html,"Djibouti, Djibouti",attractions,5.0,4.5
