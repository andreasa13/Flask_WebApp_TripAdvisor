Delicious! Must go!,"We had takeaway as the place we stayed was very comfortable. Anyway the restaurant was full as it is very popular.
It was fast to get the food and well prepared and packed.
The food was delicious! Cooked with spices and herbs that give a real taste to the veggies.
The grilled shrimps were fresh and cooked to perfection.
Really recommending this place.
It is a little hidden in the back street of the pier but worth walking there",October 2020,Aiolos Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g319780-d2010103-Reviews-Aiolos_Tavern-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
The best stay in the whole of Greece!,"I am so happy to have stayed at Andrews, this has definitely made my holiday exceptional.
The place is very clean, spacious and well looked after.
The management team/owners are attentive to details and they really take care of their guests. It felt very special to be looked after this way, their kindness is top!
The breakfast is superb, with home made products such as jam; making it so tasty and setting you up for a great day.
I would definitely stay again there and I recommend the place to anyone travelling around the area.",October 2020,Andrews Studios,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g319780-d1523540-Reviews-Andrews_Studios-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Most beautiful and vibrant of history,"This is the most beautiful part of Delphi. It is at 10 mins walk from the main sites that includes Apollo’s temple. This one is free to access, have good shows as the ground isn’t really maintained and it goes down till you find this treasure.
The oracle was done is this place and a certain energy perdures there.
A must see in the area!",October 2020,Tholos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d13092953-Reviews-Tholos-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Velocity 2 - So fun!!! We wanted more!,"Velocity 2 was the most fun part of our trip to Wales.
We went there for an afternoon when we visited Betws y coed and it’s so worth it!
Flying high and fast is an experience I would recommend to many.
I felt too short and we wanted more. We’ll go again next time we visit the area.",August 2020,Bounce Below,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g674812-d17335511-Bounce_Below-Blaenau_Ffestiniog_Snowdonia_National_Park_North_Wales_Wales.html,"Blaenau Ffestiniog, United Kingdom",activities,5.0,4.5
Old and bouncy,"It was nice to go while we were there however I wouldn’t make a trip just for that. It’s old, it’s bouncy, it’s somehow fun.
It’s a good shortcut if you are walking and want to access the other side of the village",August 2020,Sappers Suspension Bridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186447-d12167666-Reviews-Sappers_Suspension_Bridge-Betws_y_Coed_Snowdonia_National_Park_North_Wales_Wales.html,"Betws-y-Coed, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5
Beautiful and magical,"Accessing the glen is like going to a treasure hunt. Going through nature on the look to finally get to it.
The way down can be wet and slippery, better have the right shoes while going in the stairs.
But it is definitely worth it! It feels magical when you look at the glen and the flow of water.

Slight note, make sure you have £1 per person in cash. After walking 50min from Betws y coed, we weren’t allowed access until we found some money. We offered to pay contactless in the b&b beside but it was refused and no option given until we managed to get so cash.",August 2020,Fairy Glen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186447-d210110-Reviews-Fairy_Glen-Betws_y_Coed_Snowdonia_National_Park_North_Wales_Wales.html,"Betws-y-Coed, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Acropolis - Unmissable,"Yes, they ruins but they have to be seen if in Athens. I was probably lucky to visit away from the summer crowds. It is still warm and you’ll need a cap and water to climb up there. It can be steep and also slippery. With so many people walking to visit, the stones have become smooth.
The view from the Acropolis is fantastic.
The downside is the eternal renovations that spoil a bit the sight of it.",October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Incredible view and great food,"Must go while in Delphi. The view during the sunset is just superb (we had the last table in the corner).
The food was greatly made, definitely home cooked with fresh products. The flavors were just perfect!",October 2020,Taverna Vakhos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189408-d1023626-Reviews-Taverna_Vakhos-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Tasty food and great service,"Don’t get scared from the greek way to get you into the place.
The food is amazing and the service was great. It was really tasty and fresh; the grilled halloumi had a stronger feel to it and it was yummy!
There is a small terrace on top that is worth booking for the view while you eat.",October 2020,Maiandros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2315343-Reviews-Maiandros-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fantastic food with infectious smile!,"Perfect from beginning to end! We were welcomed to the place, guided for the food and even made a special fresh mint and ginger tea. The food was delicious and tasted freshly made with veggies grabbed from a garden.
If only I would have stayed longer in Athens I would have had all my breakfasts there.
Highly recommended! Can’t be missed!",October 2020,Victory Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12706875-Reviews-Victory_Cafe-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
