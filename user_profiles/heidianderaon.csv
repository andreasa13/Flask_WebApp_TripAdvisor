Most memorable,"We booked a day trip to Corinth and had an absolute blast! Alex was our driver, but he was more of a guide. He was hilarious, cheeky and professional.

Misses- Bed was small and very stiff. Road noise.

Most Memorable,"This tour was easily the most instagram worthy tour of our trip. I LOVED IT. The Royal Wedding is coming up in May, so make sure you see the Royal Apartments and Knight's rooms so you can say you've been there! My favorite part was BAth, but that was the primary reason we booked this trip to begin with. As a Harry Potter fan, I WAS SO SHOCKED TO VISIT THE REAL GODRIC'S HOLLOW. That was an awesome surpise. The pub was so cute and delicious, you could feel it's history as soon as you walked through the front door.

Easily the best part of my England trip. 10/10 do recommend.",February 2018,"Stonehenge, Windsor and Bath with Pub Lunch in Lacock",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g186338-d11447348-Stonehenge_Windsor_and_Bath_with_Pub_Lunch_in_Lacock-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",activities,5.0,4.5

Happily Surprised.,"Skeptical, as I've only ever had Ethiopian once, from a family friend. I could not be more happy with the diamond I've found in the rough of Spokane. I have gone daily, for the past 3 days. The picture I'm posting is of the owner, who roasts the coffee beans she sells. As an experienced barista, her coffee has the smoothest taste and simply the best blend I've ever had in my life. Do you and your friends and taste buds a favor by planning to eat here.

Not impressed.,"I had a friendly waitress, that was about the only good thing about my entire meal. I've never had a burger taste so bland and rocky. Maybe it's just because I hold burgers to a high standard, I don't know. My fries were impressively tasty though. My experience, was mediocre, maybe I'll go back?

Exactly what Sidney needed.,"This new spot is perfect for dates, meeting with old and new friends, or just a relaxing night filled with beer. Open from 4-10 in the evenings, I think their burgers are top quality. Best part is, they change their menu biweekly (I think). The desserts are my favorite, and the kids menu is practical- chicken strips and mac 'n cheese. Great spot if craft beer is your thing.

What an experience.,DO NOT FORGET YOUR CAMERA. This experience will be the highlight and talk of your trip when you tell your friends about Vietnam. I would recommend you touch up on you history before taking the tour because the video they show is full of propaganda.

"Cheap, Luxurious FUN.","The boat, crew and itinerary was so spectacular I guarantee it will be a tough cruise to book when it's not rainy season, here's why. We boarded the best boat in the marina and had a complimentary drink while the crew welcomed us. The rooms were exactly the size you need for a night on the water. I think it had a refrigerator, a safe, full bathroom with a shower, robes and excellent beds. I slept well that night. The view from our room was phenomenal, just as Ha Long Bay is. After we got our stuff moved in the first day, we went upstairs to the dining room and ate a marvelous buffet style lunch. Then we stopped so people could get on kayaks and small 8 person boats to experience a bat cave that was close by. We had a lot of fun, it was one of my favorite parts of the tour. After showering, it was time for happy hour before dinner! Dinner was a fancy 5 course meal served with different fruits and seafood. My friends and I went down to learn how to fish for squid, though our luck wasn't high that night. But I caught a crab! (haha)
The next morning we had a light breakfast before a hike to see a couple caves, ate breakfast when we got back and said our goodbyes.

The only mistake we made at Ha Long Bay was we didn't spend enough time there!",July 2014,Pelican Cruises - Halong Private Day Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d5062699-Reviews-Pelican_Cruises_Halong_Private_Day_Cruise-Hanoi.html,"Hanoi, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,4.5
Jaw dropping.,"All of the temples in the area of Angkor Wat will make for spectacular memories and Facebook profile pictures ;) From a distance, each temple looks old and beautiful, and then you check it out up close and see its detail? Indescribable. Plan to stay there longer than 2 days if you want to see it all. Otherwise the day and a half we dedicated to temples might be long enough. We saw Ta Prohm, the Bayon (very neat), Phnom Bakheng, Angkor Wat and another one I can't remember the name of. They were all unique though Angkor Wat is the oldest and most popular temple.

To travelers who are looking for tips- 1) all of the little kids running around are just doing what they're parents telling them to do, trying to sell their souvenirs. Just keep in mind you can't help all of them. 2) We had two tuktuk drivers that were so kind and sweet, we brought them to eat lunch with us during the touring. 3) If you're looking to save money and take the time you need to marvel at the temples, don't hire the tour guides on site, just use the Cambodia book you probably have. If that is not your style, you can hire one of the guides for cheap, in your language. There was Japanese, French and Russian aside from English. If we didn't use our books, we asked our TukTuk driver friends. 4) Third world countries make me feel guilty when I drop a bunch of cash, so unless you're looking for a nice resort-style hotel during your stay, more power to you. But I recommend staying in town and supporting locally. You can check out my review for ""My Home"" in Siem Reap. I loved it there! 5) DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT lose your ticket once you're inside the temple area. They are very picky about this because if you do not have it, you are fined $100 USD. If it's wet or torn? Sorry. Keep it inside a book, where it can still be in your bag and undamaged when the rain does roll around. 6) If you don't like crowds, save Angkor Wat for last. Sunrise can get very, very packed (for good reason with the sun behind the temple for great photo-ops). 7) The guys who check your ticket were wearing blue shirts, we ran into a con official that afternoon who was trying to distract us so his friend could pick our pockets, so don't be fooled, just keep walking.

I LOVED the trip to Cambodia. I WILL be returning at some point.",July 2014,Angkor Wat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d317907-Reviews-Angkor_Wat-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,5.0
START HERE (if you aren't beginning at sunrise),"Holy Cow, great photo ops! Everywhere you turn, there is a face. We probably spent longer there than we should, but you really can stop and stare at a wall for an hour with carvings and faces and bas-reliefs. There is so much to look at! Our tuk-tuk drivers dropped us off here after entering the South Gate, which kickstarts your excitement into full blast! I recommend starting here, as shade can be provided inside if you need to get relief from the sun. But I recommend you start somewhere else if you would like to start at sunrise. Go to Angkor Wat with the 500+ people who are also wanting a good sunrise picture!",July 2014,Bayon Temple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d552507-Reviews-Bayon_Temple-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Indiana Jones Would Feel Right at Home.,"Ta Prohm is the epitome of ""power of the jungle"" because it's swallowed by trees!

Wow.,"It is hard to imagine any building that is bigger or more beautiful than Angkor Wat but the detail and experience of Angkor Thom add up to equally rival Angkor Wat in my opinion.
