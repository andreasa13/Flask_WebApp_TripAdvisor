Dinner and stay,"Room:
We booked the ground floor 3 bed apartment. Checking in was easy and we were shown across the car park to the accommodation by a very friendly member of staff. We could take the car to park right outside it to unload which was great. The apartment was lovely and spacious with lots of light. Less ‘plush’ than we expected but we were informed that some soft furnishings would be removed for cleaning regimes with Covid. Beds were super comfortable and lovely large bath sheets for the bathrooms. Kitchen was well equipped with fridge/freezer, microwave, dishwasher and washing machine. Would have benefitted a coffee pod machine that many hotel rooms now provide. A good choice for multiple couples or a family.
Negatives: Bathrooms were uninspiring, and 2nd King bedroom had a strong smell of damp.

Restaurant:
Very well organised with hand sanitiser on entry and one way markings on the floor. Tables were well spaced apart, QR code for the menu and staff adhered to all guidelines. With all restrictions it still had a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Food was absolutely delicious. Scallops with cauliflower were cooked to perfection and sweet and tender, bavette steak was melt in the mouth and to die for. Everything beautifully presented and worth the money.

Breakfast:
We were asked to choose breakfast items the night before and specify a time. Fresh orange juice was sweet and delicious, full English was spot on, super pastries and all served with a smile. Set us up for the whole day!",October 2020,The Kings Head Bawburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2661845-d9570770-Reviews-The_Kings_Head_Bawburgh-Bawburgh_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Bawburgh, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great location,"We stay in Norwich a lot but first time here. Plus points: Location is perfect for the city centre. Check in was easy, we were texted the door code and given instructions how to find our room. This is an old property with lots of characterful features. Staff very friendly, coffee machine and breakfast were lovely. Brownies in the room on arrival a nice touch. Main bed comfortable. Less good points: We stayed as 3 adults in a family room that had a sofa bed in a separate small lounge area. Unfortunately the mattress on the sofa bed was very thin but we softened the bed springs with another duvet we found in a cupboard - this could be easily fixed with a foam mattress topper. Although the booking was for 3 adults there were only 2 cups and 2 glasses provided - small details make a difference. This is an old property with creaking floors, wonky walls and such, but the paintwork in shower room and by hand sink was grubby and stained - would expect it to look clean. Overall a nice stay.",September 2020,38 St Giles Boutique Bed & Breakfast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186342-d1075436-Reviews-38_St_Giles_Boutique_Bed_Breakfast-Norwich_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Norwich, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,5.0
A wonderful surprise,"From the outside to be honest JoJo’s didn’t look that interesting. On walking in there was a wonderful ambiance with the lighting, decor and smiling staff and it was much larger that it looked from the outside. Staff were wearing masks and we were asked to sanitise hands on entering. Tables were spaced well apart. We booked in advance and had to pay a deposit but were completely happy to do so. Thoroughly enjoyed the mezze platter which was beautifully presented. The flash fried steak and Patatas bravas as a main were equally delicious and filling. Really pleased with the quality of the food, service, surroundings and value for money. Would recommend.",September 2020,JoJo's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503922-d730853-Reviews-JoJo_s-Whitstable_Kent_England.html,"Whitstable, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Booked in advance. Nice ambiance,Booked in advance. Nice ambiance in the evening with dimmed lighting and candles on the tables. Surprised that staff weren’t wearing masks (two other restaurants we visited previous nights were) although bread was served in a paper bag with a wrapped pat of butter - not sure why that was necessary as all other food was served normally. Tables well spaced out. We were served promptly and politely - I asked for a chair cushion and this was no problem at all. Oysters and scallops were very good and grilled sardines and sea bass for mains well cooked. I asked to take the oyster shells home and they were given back to me spotlessly cleaned. Couldn’t fit in a pudding but there was a nice selection. Happy with the price for the location and freshness of produce.,September 2020,The Whitstable Oyster Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503922-d1005800-Reviews-The_Whitstable_Oyster_Company-Whitstable_Kent_England.html,"Whitstable, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Courtyard dining,"We booked a table for courtyard dining to make sure we got a table. Love seeing how this restaurant has diversified during the Covid lockdown. Had visited their shop a few times in recent weeks for AMAZING bread, pesto, cakes and fresh produce. Now with outside dining you can get to sample the delicious ingredients cooked to perfection first hand and the glorious garden and surrounds. The beef salad was insanely delicious, best beef I have tasted in a very long time. Well organised, leave your details for track and trace, blankets if you need, really convivial atmosphere.",August 2020,The Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190758-d10108461-Reviews-The_Kitchen-Banbury_Oxfordshire_England.html,"Banbury, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Perfect,Had a fabulous stay here. Easy walking distance from Old St. tube in a great area. Staff on reception were welcoming. Room really well laid out with the most comfy bed and pillows ever! Really appreciated the small bottle of fresh milk in the fridge rather than those horrible small uht cartons. Lovely toiletries in the bathroom and decent sized towels! Room was very quiet despite the buzz in the bar and grill downstairs. Also appreciated being able to open the window and the great blackout curtains - all these details count! Breakfast in a bag was just right for us. Would definitely stay again.,February 2020,"The Hoxton, Shoreditch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d621785-Reviews-The_Hoxton_Shoreditch-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Good place,"i have been to quite a few game lodges over the years with my South African friends. This is the smallest and quietest we have visited, but we were made to feel very welcome. Piet, Daisy and Erik were all very helpful and I was moved from a room to a chalet at no extra cost so be adjacent to my friends in their chalet. We take all our stuff with us which is needed as there are no basic provisions in the chalets for cooking (such as tea, coffee, salt, pepper etc) or the bathrooms other than hand soap. The chalets are perfectly appointed for two people; with a stoop, table, chairs and braai. Inside is a bed area (very comfortable bed) and wardrobe with decent hanging space as well as sections for other clothes. There is aircon, an upright fan and a TV. There are 2 armchairs and a small coffee table opposite the bed and in the kitchen setion you have a tall fridge freezer, kettle, toaster, hob, and a good selection of pots, pans, cutlery, crockery and glassware. The bathroom is a good size with a walk in shower. Onsite there is a small pool with two loungers and a sun umbrella. The compound is very small but there are still plenty of birds and animals to see. We saw Blue Wildebeest, Zebra, Impala, Warthogs, Monkeys, Mongoose and a Jackal, the first two coming right up to the boundary fence - beautiful. You can book a game drive with Erik for R300 per person, but he was fully booked when we wanted to go so we went to nearby Tshikwalo Lodge which worked out well as they have a large restaurant on site and we could eat there after the sunset game drive. There are also self drive routes around but we did not do them. There is a nearby place that has a supermarket, liquor store etc if you need provisions. We had two power outages, one while we were on the game drive and Tshikwalo Lodge restaurant had a generator so we were still able to eat and have a pleasant evening. The 2nd power outage left us with no power to sockets, aircon etc in the evening and also following morning, so we came home earlier than planned. The site has no generator and there was a 1inch candle and matches in the room, so best to take a battery lantern or something with you. A peaceful and pleasant stay.",January 2020,De Kleine Serengeti Game Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2140845-d11825091-Reviews-De_Kleine_Serengeti_Game_Lodge-Hammanskraal_Gauteng.html,"Hammanskraal, South Africa",hotels,3.0,3.5
Average,"A busy and popular restaurant on a Sunday lunchtime. We chose dishes to reflect our favourites from a trip to Vietnam, and were thrilled to see green papaya salad on the menu. The ingredients were fresh and appeared authentic but there was little flavour to the dressing (other than heat if you are a chilli) so we didn’t get the sweet, savoury, depth of flavour that we were yearning. Had to use a mix of the table condiments to improve it which was a shame. Rice paper pancakes were good, spicy pho was a very generous helping but not really spicy and again lacked a depth to it. We enjoyed the freshness of the ingredients but missed the flavoursome aspects of the Vietnamese cuisine we had experienced.",January 2020,Pho Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186361-d13008404-Reviews-Pho_Restaurant-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html,"Oxford, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Murder Mystery venue,"This hotel is perfect for the Murder Mystery nights - basic accommodation, adequate food and fantastic performers. Would not stay if it were not for an event, but it was obviously popular and quite full the weekend we visited. Staff were exceptionally helpful, room clean and comfortable but with an off-putting smell of damp/drains down the corridor to our room. Sunday morning breakfast was very busy, had to eat in the bar area and cooked food not particularly appealing. However the whole price for room, dinner, entertainment and breakfast was well worth it. See you again for more sleuthing.",November 2019,The Olde Barn Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g503981-d249298-Reviews-The_Olde_Barn_Hotel-Marston_Grantham_Lincolnshire_England.html,"Marston, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
Comfortable,"Staff on reception were friendly and had a nice welcome. Excellent parking. Twin room was spacious with two queen beds, decent sized bathroom, very soft robes and slippers. Fantastic to be able to open the window for fresh air (although there is air con available). Good tea and coffee with biscuits. On a negative side the decor is dated, carpet was heavily stained and fitted sheet did not properly cover the mattress and the mattress had a split where you could see the inner. But saying that, the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was standard buffet with typical cereal, toast and cooked choices. Food was well cooked and hot. On the downside on the website it says the vegan breakfast includes sausages, hash browns, beans, spinach and tomato. However when my friend asked the waitress, the mushrooms had been cooked in butter, she asked the chef and said that they couldn’t be definite that the hash brown was vegan, and the sausages were vegetarian which again she couldn’t confirm meant they were also vegan. No spinach was offered, but they did cook some mushrooms specially in oil.",November 2019,Future Inn Plymouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186258-d602956-Reviews-Future_Inn_Plymouth-Plymouth_Devon_England.html,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
Vegan disappointing,"We ate in the restaurant the first night of our stay at The Future Inn. The head waiter was an absolute delight and we thoroughly enjoyed the service from him (apparently he was new but obviously very experienced in hospitality). He was the main reason that we decided not to complain about the vegan meal. Thai stir fried noodles sounded delicious and there were some lovely fresh vegetables, fresh chilli and garnish on the dish but it was spoiled by swimming in a brown gloopy sauce that must have been straight from a jar - it certainly wasn’t Thai, more like a hoisin or plum sauce which was very concentrated. We picked the noodles and veg out of it. Such a shame. Restaurant lacks any atmosphere, but is obviously convenient for guests staying.",November 2019,Fishbone Restaurant and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186258-d1005964-Reviews-Fishbone_Restaurant_and_Bar-Plymouth_Devon_England.html,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,3.0
Decent,Early Friday evening meal - bar was very busy and restaurant busy enough but OK in terms of service and waiting time. Nice to see a specific vegan menu although one of our choices apparently hasn’t been available since the menu was changed. Squash curry was very tasty but not a particularly generous portion for the price. Decent but nothing outstanding.,November 2019,The Jack Rabbit Vintage Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186258-d1112301-Reviews-The_Jack_Rabbit_Vintage_Inn-Plymouth_Devon_England.html,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Old meets new,This beautiful old building is deceptively spacious and modern on the inside but with traditional features blended so well. Staff very helpful and welcoming. Our junior suite was beautifully decorated to feel modern and clean but with the old windows and fireplace it was characterful. Loved the shower with a mural of the arcade and the additional dressing room. Huge bed which was exceptionally comfortable with lovely pillows. No aircon but the windows do open for ventilation and I noticed two electric desk fans that could be used in the summer. Good tea and coffee facilities but no fridge. Breakfast was plentiful and well cooked. Car park a bonus. Easy walking distance to all the city centre attractions. Pricey for day-to-day stays but lovely for a special occasion.,October 2019,Maids Head Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186342-d192784-Reviews-Maids_Head_Hotel-Norwich_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Norwich, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Vegan pad thai,Came here with our son who is vegan and the vegan Pad Thai was out of this world delicious! Papaya salad was reminiscent of our holidays in Vietnam and the jungle curry was also good. Service was prompt and attentive. Very noisy in the background but we were in a quieter corner.

Best foot forward,"After about feet had taken a pounding with a few days sightseeing in Athens, it was nice to have a bit of fishy TLC! We found the place to be clean - you wash your feet first, dry with a disposable towel and put on disposable slippers. Any cuts or bites are covered before you slowly lower your feet into the tank. The initial sensation is quite strange, but you soon settle into it and it is fascinating watching the fish get busy. 10 mins was enough for the experience.",October 2019,KissingFish,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482941-d4808903-Reviews-KissingFish-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Best in Oia,"There are countless hotels offering luxury and caldera views in Oia, but I doubt any have such a special and personal feel that Onar villas provides. Run by a wonderful family with only 6 villas to look after, you will have a very warm, friendly and personal stay and feel looked after from start to finish. We enjoyed chatting to the charming Tasos, Sophia was so helpful arranging taxis, booking meals and car hire always with a smile and Kiki organising the most delicious breakfasts. My husband says he has never had such perfectly cooked eggs! Obviously the view of the Caldera is important and Onar villas is perfectly situated to be just outside the main busy thoroughfare of Oia so you get the view without the hoards of people. Very close to a mini market and good restaurants and not many steps to get to the road. The hot tub (gloriously warm) with the Olive suite is on the edge of the terrace and so you can look out across the water - perfect. The terrace is a good size for two, with lovely beanbag loungers as well as table and chairs. From the terrace you step down into the Olive suite villa and a lovely area with sink, nespresso machine, kettle, full sized fridge with ice compartment, plates, cutlery, glasses and olive oil and vinegar. Ideal space for preparing a light Greek salad for lunch! We were also given a free bottle of water each day. A couple of more steps down into the bathroom from the hallway - very unusual to be showering in an old oven! Gorgeous smelling toiletries provided, along with robes and slippers. The bedroom area had a small hanging rail and a small set of drawers. Lovely comfortable bed with crisp white linen. Aircon, hairdryer and a TV available (didn’t use, so don’t know about channels). Everything was exceptionally clean with lovely attention to detail.

History to enjoy,"Definitely worth a visit here and admission price is reasonable. It is a great excavation site and interesting to watch some people painstakingly working on an area while we were there. Excellent walkways around the site and being covered it was a relief from the heat of the day. There are toilets, drink vending machines and a museum shop on site. You can pay for a guided tour but we just read the information boards ourselves as we walked around at our own pace. We paid €5 to park, but when we left around an hour or so later the car park attendant had ‘shut up shop’ so parking was apparently free then.",October 2019,Akrotiri Archaeological Site,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1189834-d4126654-Reviews-Akrotiri_Archaeological_Site-Akrotiri_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0

Superb,"Went here for lunch before our flight home. What a perfect spot. Really relaxed seating and lovely views. Food seemed to be brought out when it was cooked rather than one table at a time, so dishes did arrive at different times. However this was no problem as it meant for a relaxed dining experience. Very much enjoyed the complementary Raki drink and rusks , cheese, oil and olives to start while we were choosing from the delicious menu. The Cretan salad was the best we’d had, the grilled asparagus with cheese AMAZING, baked aubergine and chickpea stew both equally tasty.

A must see - along with thousands of others...,"We were lucky enough to stay at the far end of Oia in a quieter spot overlooking the caldera. The Main Street is stupidly busy depending on how many cruise ships dock each day. The best time we found was late evening after the sunset when most of the people on the coaches had gone. If you have lots of €s you can buy wonderful jewellery, expensive clothes and have expensive meals with exceptional views. It’s an Instagramer’s delight with vain people posing like models for hours on end to get the perfect shot. It is a beautiful place to see, but somehow is spoilt by those vying to take the posed shots rather than soak in the beauty of the geography. There are some wonderful back streets we found with restaurants that have no sunset views but do have charming staff and delicious food",October 2019,Oia's Main Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d8047123-Reviews-Oia_s_Main_Street-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Sunset sipping!,"Booked a table for around 6pm in order to see the sun set. Beautiful views across the caldera for sure. Went for the 10 wine flight each which was easily manageable with some additional cheese and meat platters. Yes it was busy, yes the waiter had said the same thing 1,000s of time to each table ordering the wine flight, but it was still a lovely evening and worth the splurge for the experience. Do a wine tasting tour if you want to be talked through each wine, but we were happy reading our numbered menu and drinking the wine at our own pace.

Seated up on a terrace we could see and smell the food being cooked on the outside grill - delicious. Unfortunately service was a bit haphazard, firstly being brought someone else’s order and secondly only served one of the two starters we ordered, but it was delicious food and well priced.

Glad we chose here,"Firstly, if getting a taxi to the bay to have food and watch the sunset - leave extra time as the road became blocked and it was horrendous! That aside, we enjoyed the vista and the sunset got better as the night wore on. Our waitress was helpful, coming back to tell us the weight of half or the whole fish we chose, so there were no surprises with the cost at the end. Enjoyed our baked feta to start and the grilled sea bream was meaty and tasty. Ask what fish are frozen as some of the less expensive dishes are.

Delicious menu that instantly tells you they take pride in ingredients and preparing food for the soul.

Would suggest non slip footwear as some of the flooring is so worn it’s shiny.

Tightly packed tables, friendly staff, amazing meat and cheese deli counter in the centre and a buzz from the small visible kitchen. We ordered two starters, the meat/ cheese platter, bread and wine and had a delicious feast.

Adequate stay,"Plus points: Friendly staff, excellent location for the airport, onsite parking, comfortable beds and quirky airport themed rooms. Downsides: Poor finish to decor, aircon didn’t work, my chicken curry was actually lamb, only one chair in room when there was lots of space for a second. Overall good value for the discounted price we paid.",October 2019,Ibis Styles London Heathrow Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g7940437-d10066767-Reviews-Ibis_Styles_London_Heathrow_Airport-Harlington_Greater_London_England.html,"Harlington, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
Just lovely,"Went here for lunch for the first time on the Friday before bank holiday. The weather was lovely so we sat outside and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful views from the garden. There were lots of benches and I’m sure it gets pretty busy at the weekends. We ordered the bread platter, heirloom tomato salad and chicken satay to share between 2 of us. Bread was delicious and the roasted garlic yummy! Salad was really tasty and fresh (maybe a bit overpriced for what it was) and chicken was very moist and cooked well. Would have liked a bit more spice in the satay sauce. All in all a delicious lunch in a perfect setting. Inside eating area looked lovely and cosy and I could see it would be nice on closer days.",August 2019,White Hart Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187063-d3447992-Reviews-White_Hart_Inn-Leamington_Spa_Warwickshire_England.html,"Leamington Spa, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Clean and good value,"Stayed in a triple room for one night. We have stayed in a neighbouring hotel twice before but this worked out at £60 cheaper for the night, so we decided to try the Judd. Clean, freshly decorated and with a lovely light and bright breakfast room we were very pleased. Staff at breakfast were very attentive and breakfast was a decent standard. Room had all you need including hairdryer and air con. Rooms in these mews style properties are compact so don’t expect a lot of space, but for the position in central London the Judd is good value. There is no lift so if you have problems with stairs I would suggest you request a ground floor room. About 5 mins walk from Kings Cross and St. Pancras station, in a quiet crescent away from the main road - ideal.",June 2019,Judd Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1791870-Reviews-Judd_Hotel-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,3.5
Fabulous,"Went here for breakfast and lunch and both fabulous. The pan con tomate was excellent as was bocadillo con tomate y anchovy. Later for lunch we had lovely tapas of Patatas bravas, Galician octopus, clams, huge prawns in garlic (expensive), calimari and pork. Our waiter Ramon was always whistling and such a lovely man. Wine kept being topped up and all in all lovely. Very busy place - you might have to wait for a table, but decent food.",June 2019,Boatella Tapas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187529-d2096091-Reviews-Boatella_Tapas-Valencia_Province_of_Valencia_Valencian_Country.html,"Valencia, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Mind blowing,"Still smiling at the memory of this experience - a meal, show and club all rolled into one. You must book in advance which I did online in the uk and I specified we had a vegetarian in the group and were attending on my sons birthday. He had specific vegetarian items all throughout which were exceptional and it was a lovely touch that his birthday was incorporated into the show with music and a candle - thank you to our attentive hosts. Each element of the food is described and the translation into English was welcomed so we could enjoy the experience too. Other reviews explain some of the themes and meals and we were surprised and thrilled at each stage of our journey. It may seem expensive in booking but is well worth it, you experience food you will never have anywhere else as well as a show - a real entertaining evening. Drinks are topped up regularly and you can have beer or wine which is different for each course (included in the price apart from the first drink when you arrive which you pay for). You must go!",June 2019,Samsha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187529-d1965815-Reviews-Samsha-Valencia_Province_of_Valencia_Valencian_Country.html,"Valencia, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fabulous,"What a brilliant place, love the different zones and opportunity to be outside as well as inside. Very clean and well organised. Shark tunnel is exceptionally busy, but we enjoyed the jellyfishes and cuttlefish probably the most - something for everyone. Nice to see the belugas but sad to see them in captivity. Food was pricey but we expected that - table service was poor and we had to ask three times for a meal to come then got charged for it twice, however the main attraction was obviously the exhibits which we thoroughly enjoyed.",June 2019,Oceanogràfic València,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187529-d621223-Reviews-Oceanografic_Valencia-Valencia_Province_of_Valencia_Valencian_Country.html,"Valencia, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5

Great lunch,"Many restaurants along this front and we were lucky to choose this one. Fairly busy at 3:30pm but not too crowded. Restaurant goes back quite far and is nicely decorated, tables nicely laid out and staff attentive. Valencian salad to start (crispy and delicious on such a hot day) followed by a vegetable and a seafood paella which were both well cooked. Very enjoyable lunch and would recommend this restaurant.",June 2019,El Coso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187529-d987374-Reviews-El_Coso-Valencia_Province_of_Valencia_Valencian_Country.html,"Valencia, Spain",restaurants,4.0,3.5

Pretty good,The staff outside encouraged us to try their menu as we explained we had a fussy vegetarian. They pointed out the vegetarian options and we went for the felafel burger which apparently had the best felafels my son had tasted. Octopus skewers were tasty but not plentiful as it was very thin slices. Fried anchovies with a side of fries was a hit and steak maybe a little over cooked for requested medium. Cheesecake delicious. Dishes did not all come out at the same time and I saw other tables waiting a long time also for all dishes to be served which is a shame. Staff were attentive and we enjoyed sitting outside on the terrace. Wine very reasonably priced for a bottle and overall a good meal.,June 2019,Haus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187529-d12374988-Reviews-Haus-Valencia_Province_of_Valencia_Valencian_Country.html,"Valencia, Spain",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Feast for the eyes as well as stomach!,"What strikes you when you enter is how light, airy and cool it is inside, with nice wide aisles so gives a feeling of space.

Expensive and poor food,We though as the place was busy and down a side street this would be a good find. However the menu was expensive with nothing cheap for a lunch (we should have moved on at that stage). Potato salad with tuna was like a tinned potato salad of the ‘70s with a couple of flakes of tuna on top. Valenciana paella dry and tasteless and we were charged 4€ for the ‘complementary’ bread that was brought to the table as soon as we sat down. An expensive mistake.,June 2019,Restaurante Manyans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187529-d3878549-Reviews-Restaurante_Manyans-Valencia_Province_of_Valencia_Valencian_Country.html,"Valencia, Spain",restaurants,2.0,3.0
Could do with a freshen up,"Our 2nd stay here, last time nearly 3 years ago. Still great for location and lovely breakfast, but found the room a bit tired and needing some tlc, especially the bathroom - large amounts of peeling paint can not pass off as industrial retro. I would be less annoyed if it were a budget hotel, but for £150 for the night I found this disappointing.",April 2019,The Georgian Townhouse & Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186342-d210683-Reviews-The_Georgian_Townhouse_Apartments-Norwich_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Norwich, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
All show,"On first look the array of ice creams look so tempting, but unfortunately they tasted like they had been made from syrup (sorbets had an artificial taste) and a packet mix (ice cream had a powdery taste). Very loud with competing music and TV and decor was too much. Not the treat that we thought it was going to be, but it was busy so must be popular with others.",April 2019,Sundaes Gelato,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186342-d12505096-Reviews-Sundaes_Gelato-Norwich_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Norwich, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Nice menu,"Enjoyed an evening meal here, sampling a variety of the main course dishes which were well presented and tasty.

Tasty fare,"The restaurant was surprisingly busy for a Monday evening which was a good sign. Disappointed that there was not much on the specials board, but main menu was sufficient. Both the monkfish and scallop starters were delicious. Fish and chips tasty and Goan fish curry was good but lacked depth of flavour (felt like it was fish cooked separately with a curry sauce on top and mussels on top of that) rather than a dish that had been cooked as ‘one’.
