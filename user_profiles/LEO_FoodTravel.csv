I was in Seoul for 2 weeks,"I was in Seoul for 2 weeks and craved some Vietnamese food since I am of Vietnamese descent.

A little hard to find but it’s basically right around the corner. At first, I was looking for the restaurant inside the building with all the stores but quickly realized they weren’t located inside.

The staff here is friendly and helpful. I ordered a bowl of Pho and vermicelli. It came with a few side pickled vegetables which is typical to Korean meals, but I didn’t eat them since I wanted to eat Vietnamese food.

Eating here was almost like mom’s cooking. It was tasty and worth the trip. The broth was rich and savoury. The noodles and vermicelli were well cooked.

Our room wasn’t the fanciest but it was decent and thoroughly cleaned everyday. The staff at the hotel and restaurant were extremely friendly and helpful, this was a huge plus to our trip to Santorini. Breakfast was also included and it was delicious.

Bad experience,"We arrived here and it was already quite busy on the rooftop and therefore decided to go on the 3rd floor.

We ordered our drinks the first time and that was it, did not get any service and spoke to the waitress after this first (and last order). This young waitress should get her things together because her customer service skills are the worst.

We paid and left for one of their competitors, spent our money their and service was excellent.

We shared the plates and they were magical, excellent, delicious! The plates are big and worth the price. The meats were delicious. Homemade pita bread was the best. Although I saw the woman who was making the bread drop the uncooked dough on the ground and put it back up on the tray to cook. Other than that, everything else was perfect.

The 4-star is because of that woman and her dough on the ground.

Greek salad, meat plate, beer, homemade pita bread and tzatziki came to a total of 39 euros.

Not the best,"Group of 4 - We visited this restaurant as the reviews weren’t bad.

First of all, we had the weirdest waiter ever. He made the whole service awkward.

Then comes the menu and food. We started with a cheese and charcuterie plate. It wasn’t bad but definitely could’ve been better elsewhere. Plate was a bit small for the price. I ordered a burger platter - 4/10, not the best, but eatable if you’re hungry. I also ordered an IPA, IBU was probably very low, too bad they don’t add more info on their beers. Not the best beers.

As mentioned by another person, DO NOT take the crab cake. It looked overcooked and dry.

We ate and then left as soon as possible and went back to another restaurant on the same street where service and food were 100% better.

I absolutely DO NOT recommend this restaurant.

I also see that the owner replies to TripAdvisor reviews. All I will say is his behaviour shows what kind of service and food you will get by coming here. Looks like he doesn’t take bad reviews very well. Instead of being unprofessional, take the bad reviews and learn from it.",July 2019,Great Adirondack Brewing Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48023-d399444-Reviews-Great_Adirondack_Brewing_Company-Lake_Placid_New_York.html,"Lake Placid, New York",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Great buffet,"I didn’t stay at the Grand Hyatt, but I went to the Grand Cafe for dinner.

First of all, the waitress who was responsible for my section was absolutely great. She provided an excellent service and cared so much for the guests. Too bad I didn’t get her name because she deserves to be known by her employer for her professionalism and great customer service skills. Service was overall very good from all the restaurant staff. I am very glad I chose to come here. I believe that the staff really made the dining experience beyond enjoyable, it was my best buffet experience.

Food was also excellent, very great variety of meat, carbs, but lacks a little bit of fresh vegetables and fruits. They even had crab legs and sashimis! Dessert... heaven! Again, great variety of desserts.

Price, a little on the expensive side but worth the meal. I don’t think you will get anything closer with the amount of food and great service anywhere else in the airport area for the same price.

Thank you to all the staff at Grand Cafe for the great food and service.

"WOW, no joke","HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I had been traveling for 5 weeks when I visited this restaurant for brunch after my workout at the gym. I was hungry and couldn’t wait to get some food. This one in my top 10 best meal in 5 weeks.

When I got to the location using my map app on my phone, it was kinda hard to find the place. A little confusing as to which was the Grain. I eventually figured out the location and it was already packed. In order to get a table, if you’re coming to a busy time, you need to go inside and add your name and # of people on the tablet, and then wait until a table becomes free. I was by myself and therefore was able to sit at the bar counter which faces to coffee machine and girl who does all the drinks and coffee.

Order is pretty simple. Since I went for breakfast/brunch, I chose the 4 options order: I picked smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, avocado and sourdough bread. I also ordered the daily cold-pressed drink which was beets, carrots, apples and lemon.

My meal was absolutely delicious. The sourdough bread was so soft inside and crusty on the outside. I had never tasted sourdough bread before and I will definitely make it when I return home from my trip. The avocado was succulent, they seasoned and added some nuts to it, and it so so tasty. One thing I want to write about is the cold-pressed drink, NO SUGAR ADDED, it was the best fruit juice I’ve had during this trip and I don’t even remember having something this delicious. I was sitting right in front of the machine and they definitely use fresh fruits and veggies and do it manually. I should’ve asked for more and more, pretty their forearms would be sore at the end of the day... just so delicious and straight from the fruits and veggies! When I first took a sip, I couldn’t believe how the mix went together so well.

I usually don’t give out reviews this good but this tiny restaurant exceeded my expectations. They desire the good reviews and I wish them well in their business. Watching them work while the place was packed and busy was good to see. They still offered excellent service and food, kudos!

The drink was 5,500 KRW and the meal 12,000 KRW. It is worth the price IMO.

Again, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant for breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner.",May 2019,Grain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294197-d15513085-Reviews-Grain-Seoul.html,"Seoul, South Korea",restaurants,5.0,5.0

I’m a huge beer fan, but man Brewdog’s IPA are bad. I came here mainly ro try their IPA and their menu is incomplete. Usually good brewers have more info on beers than that. For example, % of IBU... absent here. Some just say bitter, but there are different % of bitterness... amateurs....

I left this location in Seoul very unsatisfied. I won’t go into the fact that their beers are overpriced. I took 2 large IPA (Jack Hammer and Jooyoungbang), that weren’t even large!!! 8,900 KRW for the first one and 6,900 for the second. That’s about $10 worth of small sizes beers.

I also ordered the Patriot burger. Oh man, did the cook not check the pan or grill? It was overcooked!!! Dry as hell. Fries were decent, I like them unsalted.

Good,"It was a rainy day so I decided to step into this restaurant to take a look at their menu. Bibimbap is a must in Jeonju.

A staff showed me my table. The menu was already on the table. It had both Korean and English, very useful. I ordered the stoneware bibimbap and it obviously came with a bunch of side dishes. Just one side dish with the egg and fish that was a little too salty but the rest was tasty and good. The bibimbap itself was very good and a little spicy. I’d personally would make it more spicy but it was all good.

I had also ordered a moju which was amazing. Cinnamon flavour was definitely present.

I paid 14,000 KRW for the whole meal, which is a little on the expensive side but it was within my budget anyways.

Small portions,"Saw this restaurant on my recent visit to Jeonju.

Their menu is limited to 3 kind of Pho, fired rice, Ban xeo and what looked like Nem nuong (not sure, might have been spring rolls?).

I ordered the brisket pho and to my surprise, they only have a single size, which to me is small. It did taste like pho but maybe a little bit of beef soup powder added? Nonetheless, it was tasty but the portion was extra-small. There was almost no meat and little bit of noodle. They did offer me a second round of noodles which I gladly accepted because I was still super hungry. Also, no bean sprouts nor vietnamese basil, mint, cilantro.

Decent pub,"I visited this pub on one evening. It was a little chilly outside! Fet good to be inside. We ate at the bar counter.

Although Japanese whiskey was on the menu, I was told that they did not have any available at the time. I therefore tried some of their craft beers. I am a huge craft beer and micro breweries fan.

I ordered a burger which was a decent size. I’m not sure about the menu but it says that the meat is from wagyu beef. I’ve had Kobe beef at a restaurant in Kobe which offered different cuts (it was amazing), this burger tasted nothing (not even close) to what I had in Kobe a couple of days earlier. I gotta say that the patty tasted just like normal burgers or even less flavour. Fries were decent, not a whole lot but they were good. Beer on the other hand, I’ve had a couple and they weren’t the best. Not the worst.

I would recommend this pub for a try or nice night out with friends. It had a very good atmosphere and staff was friendly. Overall, good service although it took my server a little while to serve us our drinks that we had just ordered.

Great and affordable,"This Best Western is located on Boulevard Taschereau. At first, I was hesitant to book my stay at this hotel but I was surprisingly happy with my choice.

My room had a full size mini-fridge which was very useful as I had prepared my own meals. The room was very nice and had everything you need. It has a great selection of TV channels. Breakfast and wifi were complimentary. Breakfast could’ve been better, it was lacking fruits, I would say typical mid-range price hotel breakfast. The gym only had cardio machines and cables, not enough for me to do a good workout, I’m glad I had a membership at a gym not too far from there.

Overall experience was great, super friendly staff and my room was always neat. Great for family or on business trips, affordable prices. Down sides: no complete gym, breakfast could be better and the AC/heat unit wasn’t properly installed therefore there was fresh cold winter air coming in the room, nothing alarming tho.

I would definitely recommend this hotel.",January 2018,Best Western Hotel Brossard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g181733-d184680-Reviews-Best_Western_Hotel_Brossard-Brossard_Quebec.html,"Brossard, Canada",hotels,4.0,4.0
"The best of Ottawa, connects almost everything","This is what makes Ottawa so beautiful. You have access to the canal all year long, for walking, biking, running, canoeing, kayaking, skating and more, name it you can do a lot here. During the winter season, you have access to a 7.8 kilometers almost straight line of ice. Running or jogging here is great, beautiful views and amazing houses.

If you want to rent a canoe or kayak, go to Dows Lake and there are parking lots around the canal. There is also a small restaurant along the canal. I recommend you go there for drinks but don’t eat there. Food is overpriced and not very good. Just go there for a relaxing time.

Don’t forget to go for a walk in the Glebe, plenty of good restaurants, pubs and coffee shops. Also, on one side of the canal, you’re in Little Italy and Chinatown and on the other side, you in downtown Ottawa, ByWard Market, Rideau Center, and have all the major attractions.

This is why the Rideau Canal is exceptional. Don’t miss this on your trips!",October 2017,Rideau Canal National Historic Site,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g155004-d155445-Reviews-Rideau_Canal_National_Historic_Site-Ottawa_Ontario.html,"Ottawa, Canada",attractions,5.0,4.5

A must,"I enjoy going to a buffet restaurant once in a while but find that they often don’t offer fresh food and are mostly too salty. Mandarin is definitely different.

What I like about this location is their large variety of vegetables. The food is also fresh and packed with flavour, not too salty. Very nice choices of desserts as well.

Service is excellent and very friendly staff. Make a reservation on busy days if you don’t want to wait in line. Prices are good if not below average.

I recommend this restaurant, very family-friendly.",October 2017,Mandarin Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g15327726-d10200240-Reviews-Mandarin_Restaurant-Nepean_Ottawa_Ontario.html,"Nepean, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
One of the best,"This museum is so interesting that it will make you want to come back for more. The building is beautiful and well-located. There is grass on the roof and upper side windows is a morse code. Beautifully done!

Inside the museum, you will walk through different sections and at the end, you walk into a large room that has all kind of heavy military equipments such as tanks, trucks, cannons, even an airplane.

For parking, you can park outside or there is an underground parking lot. They are not free. There is a small restaurant near the entrance. Military personal have access to the whole museum for free by showing an ID, which is nice.

I definitely recommend you visit this beautiful museum.

Burger,"Very good burgers, good quality. Portions could be bigger and prices could be a little cheaper but everything tastes great, I've been here twice. Also, be prepared to wait on a busy night because the restaurant is tiny. Not sure if they take reservations but definitely recommend if they do.

Service could be better but it's not bad. Waitresses are decent.

Cheesy,"Louis' Restaurant & Pizzeria is located in a tough area in Ottawa called Vanier. They are just off Vanier Parkway and close to the RCMP headquarters and an office.

I first tried their pizza when my employer ordered it for lunch. Oh boy, I fell in love with their pizza. Easily the best I've had in my entire life. Their crust cheesy and amazingly delicious. I still remember my first bite, ""Oh f..., this is good!!!"". Every bite will make you want more, but you eventually gotta stop as this is not clean eating. Try to resist eating the whole box.

Prices are reasonable and service is okay. They are very friendly and treat you like family. I'm not sure if they are Italian but they sure do look like Italians (very nice people). I've eaten here at the restaurant but came here mostly for take-out. Take-out is a torture as I had to drive with that amazing smell in the car and resist taking a bite from the pizza is always a torture.

I absolutely you try this amazing restaurant!

Tuna steak,"This was our first restaurant in Lisbon and it was amazing. This restaurant is located in a very busy area at Rossio Square. This does not affect the ambiance at all as it feels very welcoming either in the patio or inside (we went here twice). The waiters are extremely nice and we had a funny one. Excellent service.

We had a tuna steak, a salty cod plate, 2 drinks and a dessert. The tuna steak was absolutely delicious, perfect cooking, perfect texture, amazingly good. Same thing for the salty cod, although I don't recommend eating it alone as it can be very salty which is the normal taste of cods. The reason why I'm writing this is they are not cheap on the portion. The portions are perfect, very good for your money. The prices are reasonable in a touristy area.

"No gym, no ice. Front desk so-so","Booked a room at this hotel for our last night in Lisboa. The room was booked online a month ago.

We took the metro to the Campo Grande station and walked 400m to the hotel. We arrived early and were advised check-in was before 14:00. We decided to wait and ate breakfast at the hotel and then waited in the lobby which has confortable couches. We then got our room at 13:00.

The room is nice, a typical hotel room. It has AC, a mini-bar, table and 2 chairs, instant-coffee, water boiler, and a very low bed. The mattress was a little too soft for me but I had a decent sleep. Bathroom is nice, good shower.

I was looking forward to go to their hotel gym but was unpleasantly surprised by what they called a health centre (gym) which includes a sauna but it was out of order at the time of our visit. The gym consisted of a treadmill and stationary bike, a stepmaster (which wasn't working), a tiny dinosaur machine of cable which was useless, and just one dumbbell of 5lbs.

In addition, I was looking to get some ice and was again unpleasantly surprised that the machine on the 4th floor didn't worked. I tried using the machine for 5 minutes, didn't work. I decided to go on the 3rd floor and a message indicated to go to the machine on the 4th floor... at this time, I obviously knew that the machine on the 4th floor didn't work. I then went down one more floor to the 2nd and, no machine. This was, with the ""gym"", a huge FAIL.

After this big failure, I went back to my room, slept a little bit and went to the bar. The prices for beer were decent and they had a nice variety of beer and drinks. We had 1 large beer and 2 strong beers, and 2 apple cider. The drinks were very good and it costed about 26 euros. We then went for dinner which was a buffet. The quality of the food was amazing. A mix of charcuterie, cheese, veggies, a tasty vegetable soup, and for the main course, pork, fish, delicious rice and pasta. To finish, there was tons of desserts! 21 euros per person for the buffet which is, in my opinion, worth it, as you would pay more for the same in à la carte restaurant.

Overall experience: nice confortable stay with good quality food. Down sides: no real gym and no ice (it was about 30 degres celcius).

Service: wasn't the best at front desk but concierge was super nice.

Would I recommend this hotel?
- YES: good food, decent price, nice variety of drinks for reasonable price.

- NO: if you want to keep up with your workout plan and want a real gym, you won't get it here.",October 2017,"Radisson Blu Hotel, Lisbon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189158-d206887-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Lisbon-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",hotels,3.0,4.0

Nice seafood basket,"Very nice location just off the water. I walked by this restaurant a few times and didn't go inside as they are always busy. I was welcomed by a young waitress and I had my table just beside a large window. It was a nice view.

I ordered the Forrest's seafood basket which consists of a bunch of fried seafood and french fries. Don't expect fine dining here, they love large portions (which seems to be typical in the US).

Everything was delicious although a little too salty.

It was funny to see that they had actually opened a restaurant based on an excellent movie.

Good for NB,"Thus restaurant is located on the Main street of Moncton. They have one side of the building which serves sushis and the other is the restaurant where they cook in front of you. I could tell that the 4 cooks were not Japanese.

Beautiful park,"This is one of the most beautiful location in the Capital region. It is managed by the National Capital Commission which has their headquarter in Ottawa, on Elgin street. The Gatineau Park's visitor centre is located on Old Chelsea road in Chelsea.

The Park is huge and goes all the way in the Pontiac. However, the main attraction is located between the cities of Gatineau and Chelsea. It has 3 main entrances, located at Promenade Gatineau, Promenade Champlain and Promenade du Lac Fortune. You can get all the information about the Park from the information booth at the entrance of Promenade de la Gatineau and also at the Visitor Centre.

You can walk the 5km around Pink Lake which is crowded especially during Fall Rhapsody, parking then is nearly impossible in the whole park. A nice trail for mountain biking is the #1 which goes all the way to Tour à feu in Luskville. The beaches at Meech Lake are busy during the summer season.

Beyoncé - Single ladies,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in January 2017. This Hilton is located right beside the provincial assembly.

Overall, I had a good experience here. The only bad thing was that my room had a door which connected to the room next to mine. At night, the guy beside me was probably partying or pre-drinking. The music was so loud that I could hear every single word of the songs... I know that he really liked the song Single ladies (put a ring on it) from Beyoncé because it was on repeat. That song still reminds me of that night when I indirectly partied with my room neighbour. I usually don't complain a lot but that night I had to, it was annoying.
