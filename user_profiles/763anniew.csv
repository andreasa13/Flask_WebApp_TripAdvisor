Last dinner on a weekend break to Athens,"A fabulous family run restaurant with tasty traditional Greek dishes. We turned up without booking and were found a comfortable table upstairs. The waiters were attentive but not over the top. The food was delicious fresh and hot. The restaurant got very busy as a group of 12 came in just after us and they had to turn people away for a while. However the service never suffered, we were very well looked after. We would certainly go there if in Athens again.",February 2020,Bandiera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10445516-Reviews-Bandiera-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Family outing,It was a well set out venue with clear information and a variety of activities for everyone. There is lots of space for the animals and for visitors to walk around . Eventhough it was the summer holiday it did not feel crowded and there was no waiting. The safari ride was lovely and particularly goid to do after lunch when the little ones were tired to walk.,August 2019,Port Lympne Reserve,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2211144-d545569-Reviews-Port_Lympne_Reserve-Lympne_Kent_England.html,"Lympne, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Terrible service,"My husband and I went in to grab a quick lunch. I asked for a tuna sandwich, M Moniz put an egg sandwich on our tray - I pointed out I had asked for tuna, he said it was egg and Tuna, so I let it go as it was hard to see without touching the food. I asked for a cappucino to drink, this was made in a latte glass and without asking me he put aerosol cream on it (which I was charged for). At this point I should have just walked away but I did not want to cause a scene. (I was hungry and my husband grumpy!) So my husband and I sat and ate our food, my husband drank the coffee as I hate cream of any kind. When I finished my sandwich (which was egg with no trace of tuna, despite being charged for tuna)I also realised to top it all he had put it on a saucer not a plate!!
Not impressed!!",June 2019,A Padaria Portuguesa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d10736300-Reviews-A_Padaria_Portuguesa-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",restaurants,1.0,3.5
