Best tour of our cruise,"The Acropolis in Athens was the highlight of our 7 day cruise of the Greek islands and Sicily,we booked the tour purely to visit this astonishing place.
As you drive round the city you can see the Parthenon sitting on top of the mountain and it makes you think of the Greek gods and mythology that you learn about as a child,
The trek from the coach park to the summit and the temples is quite steep up flights of steep steps not for the unfit or infirm but go slow and you will make it.
As you reach the the summit you overlook the city and can see for miles to the hills were the marble to build the Parthenon and other temples was obtained.
You enter the top of the Acropolis through a large gate complex and the site opens up and you see how the site was laid out with the roads and temples .
Walking is hard as the surface is broken up and slippery and uneven but wear sensible shoes and you will be fine .
We were part of a tour group so our time was limited and I wished I had more time to explore and I will go back and wander on my own as there are plenty of written descriptions of the temples and plenty to photograph",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

We arrived at reception to book in and were presented with welcome drinks the reception staff were friendly and courteous.
The reception area was quite large with comfortable chairs and couches.
We were given our room keys and went to our room which was situated on the first floor,we were very surprised when we opened the door we had been allocated a junior suite overlooking the beach and up to the mountains. We left our bags in the room and went to the restaurant situated near the reception area and overlooked the beach and the sea.
We were on an all inclusive package and didn't know what to expect re food quality having read some previous reviews,we thought we must be at the wrong hotel

Good bar good prices,"This bar was situated approximately 4 doors down from our hotel The Grand Flora Hotel so we walked past it every day and inevitably went in .

We went for lunch and being in the part of the world we're pizza was invented we ordered two Calzone a folded filled pizza, we told it was big and we should only have one and the waitress was right but then again we realised the pizza parlour next door also belonged to the pub , The Calzone here was full of filling and the bread nice and thin and set the bar for others .
The beer prices were good compared to other local pubs
The security at the pub was very friendly but could be bribed with pizza (see photo )

My wife had the open chicken and leek pie and mashed potato she had to share with me the pie was full of meat and the pastry was crisp and light .We didn't go for desert as we were too full

Great day out with the grandchildren,"Half term what to do with the grandchildren .
I have two granddaughters aged 11 and 7 who don't want to do the same thing, last year I took advantage of the Royal Historic Palaces membership what value we live quite close to Hampton Court Palace .
Today I logged onto the website and saw that they had a number of activities for children during the school half term, so off we went.
We went into the information room where both the girls picked up The Great Palace Quest which sent the children off to different parts of the palace in search of letters to make a word and to meet various Tudor characters who would give them the answers to guestions .There were minstrels, dancers and poets in the halls and corridors.
In another part of the palace The children could dress up in Tudor clothing and make a treasure box .
My two went to the Tudor Kitchen were they were shown how to make cinnamon sticks using a pestle and mortar to grind the cinnamon down and also how to make green sugar, the two cooks were going to make sugar playing cards and cinnamon sticks
We then went further in we're the were roasting beef knuckles, we didn't leave the kitchens for an hour the girls were enthralled even letting the turn the spit .
We then went and saw the musicians and dancers

Good wholesome food,"This was my first time in a polish restaurant and I'm glad I went I have never had a meal that I could not finish but the food at this restaurant beat me I had to go home and let my stomach expand .
My wife and I went to visit our son his partner and our new grandson .We had discussed this restaurant a number of times and my sons partner said why don't we go for lunch so off we went .
The restaurant has ample parking although you wouldn't know the carpark was there unless you know your way around Reading or were a regular customer .
You enter the premises by going downstairs and into the restaurant which was warm and welcoming .
We were shown to our table by the manageress who gave us our menu which was in Polish with the English translation beneath .
Our sons partner recommended several of the dishes to try .
We started with a mixed starter which includesd Polish warm smoked cheese,stuffed mushrooms, Polish black pudding , and pierogi stuffed dumplings with a selection of pickles and in the middle a bowl of lard with pork pieces and fresh bread to spread the lard on this was gorgeous.for the northerners like myself who can remberbreadvand dripping this was far better.
My wife thought that this starter was our whole lunch we then had the main course .
The meat platter as a meat eater I thought I had died and gone to heaven .
The plate consisted of a large ham shank, pork ribs,snitzels,pork chops, chicken wrapped in ham and cheese. In the centre mashed potatoes with mushrooms and herbs and a mixed plate of pierogi dumplings and sides of carrots,beetroot and salad
We had to ask for a doggy bag to take away the left over meat , my sons dogs had a great dinner as well, I only wish I had taken photos .
The next time I go and I will go I won't order so much and will try individual meals
What was the cost of our banquet £74 including drinks for 4 people

Disappointed Lunch,"This was the first lunch my wife and I had in this pub since it changed ownership, we arrived at the pub at 11.50 today 25/01/2017 and I went to the bar to order food I was told that I couldn't order from the menu as the were still serving the breakfast menu and to come back at 12 but I could buy drinks. I returned at the appropriate time and submitted my order I ordered the mixed grill which consisted of according to the menu a
(A Rump steak gammon steak chicken fillet Cumberland sausage fried egg with chips half a tomato and peas ) I decided to upgrade to the mega mixed grill extra egg sausage and battered onion ring s.my wife had the New York burger with Curly fries .
Whilst waiting a member of staff came over and said that they did not have any chicken .They stated that they didn't have any as they had only opened on Friday
I was offered a slice of bacon instead but this is not chicken . I thought teething troubles.
My mega mixed grill arrived minus the extras I had paid for extra sausage egg and onion rings it did come with the bacon slice .
This pub was previously owned by Whetherspoons were a large mixed grill was a large mixed grill I brought my complaint to a member of staff but the appeared indifferent
Maybe this was just a one off due to new ownership but I won't be going back",January 2017,The Regent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1842228-d2659964-Reviews-The_Regent-Walton_On_Thames_Surrey_England.html,"Walton-On-Thames, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Fantastic days out,"Our day out at Hampton Court Palace was one of discovery we went with our granddaughters one of which is studying the Tudor period we covered the palace over two days .The children wanted to go back for more .
We walked around the gardens the first day which were in bloom there were fields of daffodils amongst the trees .The children saw a trolley car being drawn by two Welsh shire horses and immediately wanted to go for a ride, The wagon master gave us an interesting talk about the guided gates and its relevance to the nursery rhyme Mary Mary quite contrary .
Hampton Court Palace has a new area called the Magic Garden which is a large children's play area with slides and mirrors and tree houses and the large centre piece a Welsh Dragon that has water spray coming from its mouth resembling smoke .you can then go from there to the Maze.
Our granddaughter took part in a small play entitled Henry's Wedding feast were all the characters were in costume.
The second day we purely did the palace inside again we went with our grandchildren ,
the children were allowed to dress up in cloaks and we opted for the audio tour of which you had two choices the children's version or adults we opted for the children's this was informative but also funny .
We spent 4 hours in the palace going through all the different state apartments ending in the Tudor kitchens were the children were allowed to assist in the cooking of two joints of beef by turning the spit over the fire the children were paid by the kitchen steward 1 groat as a wage.
If you like doing the Royal Historic Palaces is to buy the yearly family pass this at the time of writing was £83 for two adults and upto 6 children under the age of 16 .
The pass not only allows entry to Hampton Court but also The Tower of London ,Kensington Palace ,Kew Palace The Banquet house and also Hillsborough Castle in Belfast .
The pass lasts for 1 year but at the time of writing this review it was 15 months.
Anyone visiting it is worthwhile looking at the Royal Historic Palaces Website to see what savings can be made .
