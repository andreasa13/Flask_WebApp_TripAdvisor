A must stop! Food was delicious,We stopped here one afternoon as it was recommended by one of our Tour Guides. The atmosphere was quaint and welcoming. The food was so good!

Great tour to learn and see about historical Greece,"It was interesting to know this was pre Pompeii and I had never heard about it! Our tour guide was great! The way she told the history was fantastic. We spent about 2.5 hours walking around. Great stop if in Santorini!

After the tour take the road down and see the beautiful water!",April 2019,Akrotiri Archaeological Site,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1189834-d4126654-Reviews-Akrotiri_Archaeological_Site-Akrotiri_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Spectacular Winery! A must if in Santorini,We visited this winery as part of an excursion with our tour. I am so glad we signed up for this as it was one of my top places we saw. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and it gave our group time to get to know each other and bond. The wine was excellent and I bought a few bottles to take home for family and friends. The different meal options provided were fantastic! It was a great tour that provided a lot of laughs and lovely memories. Highly recommend.,April 2019,Vassaltis Vineyards,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d10336667-Reviews-Vassaltis_Vineyards-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Nice Hotel - Great Location -,"We were hoping that at this hotel we would have some sort of view. We didn't. It was of another wall! We did have our own little hot tub. Unforunatly, it was too cold when we were there to enjoy it. Our room was very nice and clean. The beds were very uncomfortable and my pillow was as thick as a piece of paper. There were additional blankets in the closet. The bathroom was recently renovated. The shower was amazing! The staff was very friendly. Our balconies were right next to our neighbors. Unforunatly, when they were out smoking you were forced to shut your door, since the smoke bothered us.

The hotel bar by the pool had amazing drinks and the views were spectular. The breakfast buffet in the morning was good. It was not my favorite of the trip. They served the same thing each day. The second day, we wanted to enjoy our breakfast outside and the staff seemed to want us too as many felt it was too cold. They did end up unlocking the door but quickly locked it after I had taken two cups of coffee out. I had to ask a staff member to let me out again to gather my belongings to come back inside.

The location was a short walk into town. Lots of stairs!",April 2019,Santorini Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d231228-Reviews-Santorini_Palace-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
1/2 day Tour - Worth It,"You take a ferry to the island of Delos. Our Tour Guide was named George. We walked around the ruins of the Santuary of Apollo, The Sacred Cave, the Lion Terrace and the House of Dionysis. The entire tour was breathtaking. Walking around and seeing these ancient ruins is so interesting. The weather when we went was very windy. I am not sure if it is normally like this. I would recommend seeing this site.

Wear comfortable shoes and clothes. We heard in the summer it is very hot and there is hardly anyhere to get shade.",April 2019,Archaeological Site of Delos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g202339-d4297568-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Delos-Delos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Delos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very happy we picked this place!,"It was rather chilly and raining the night we ate here. They had placed their plastic tarps around the outside area and added heat warmers. The staff was friendly and prompt. When I went to order my meal, the waiter recommended another dish that I went with and it was so good!

Highly recommended stopping here!",April 2019,Kadena,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d2031513-Reviews-Kadena-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Lunch was spectacular along with the view and the staff!,"We were “lured” in by the hostess! Very similar to South Beach in Miami. We had a fantastic seat facing the water. We ordered fun cocktails and had an appetizer and lunch. I got the spinach pie and it was one of my favorite lunches I had!

Would highly recommended going back!",May 2019,Rouvera Restaurant & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d2476009-Reviews-Rouvera_Restaurant_Bar-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Cute area to walk around,"We just walked around and took in all the beauty! The day we were there was extremely windy and cold. A lot of the places that would normally have outdoor seating weren’t set up. In addition several sections of the walk ways were blocked off due to the windy and the waves.

Overall highly recommended walking over and checking it out!",May 2019,Little Venice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g662620-d519760-Reviews-Little_Venice-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

"Good Views, not good location to walk","We stayed here in the beginning of April. The hotel was nice. Our rooms were clean but the rooms didn’t have any personality. No photos or decor on the walls. We had a nice outside porch. The views were nice. Unfortunately it rained heavily so we only sat outside once. We didn’t experience it but a few of our travel companions had flooding in their rooms that came in from under their doors.

The bathroom was fine. There was a giant window in the shower that you could see into the main room. We had to keep the shade down. The shower did overflow as there was no lip to keep the water in.

Beds were not very comfortable. Pillows were very flat.

The hotel is not in walking distance to the town. They do offer a shuttle that runs every two hours that takes you and picks you up. We decided to take it early one morning (8am) before we had an afternoon excursion. I believe we woke the driver up after speaking to the front desk at 8:15 on when the shuttle would arrive. No one could understand why we wanted to go into town as nothing was open. But that was the point! We wanted to walk around when there might not be as many tourist. We also used it late one night, midnight. It arrived on time.

The breakfast buffet was by far one of my favorite in Greece. The variety of food everyday was amazing. Breads, eggs, pies, yogurt, fruits, jams, all of it was so good!!

Overall the hotel was good. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are on different levels. Lots of stairs!!",April 2019,San Antonio Summerland Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g662620-d206782-Reviews-San_Antonio_Summerland_Hotel-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Something different- ALOT of fun,"What a great tour this was! Unfortunately due to the heavy rains we didn’t tour the farm. But that didn’t take away from what an amazing memory this was. The hosts were so welcoming. We heard about the history of the island and then had our wine tasting which is always fun

We had the demonstration of spinach pie and tzatziki. This was also a lot of fun. They then served us lunch which tasted amazing!

The whole experience was really enjoyable and I would recommended going here if you are visiting Mykonos!",April 2019,Mykonian Spiti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189430-d6681044-Reviews-Mykonian_Spiti-Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Athens-Mykonos-Ok. Mykonos to Santorini - Worst Experience,"We took this from Athens to Mykonos. We had to board at a ridiculous hour. I believe we had to leave the hotel at 4 am. Luckily we had a tour guide who directed us where to go and where to place our luggage. The boat was delayed and we didn’t leave when we were supposed to. Boat ride to Mykonos was fine. I don’t typically get sea sick so the waves didn’t bother me much. Getting off the boat was chaotic. People running yelling and pushing you.

Now the ride from Mykonos to Santorini. This was the worst experience of my life and I am not being dramatic. Our boat was supposed to leave at 10 am. It was over an hour late. The ride was I believe supposed to take 2 1/2 hours. We were on the ride for over 4. It was a completely full ferry. I had fallen asleep and when I woke up their were multiple passengers already with puke bags. There were employees going up and down the aisles passing out bags. It was so bad, I ended up taking one (even though I didn’t get sick). They were making announcements asking if anyone on the boat had medical experience as passengers were passing out. We stopped for a little bit which helped as the waves were too much and we couldn’t go to the original port we were planning on. Then they started to make announcements that they were figuring out how they could safely get us off the boat. When we were finally getting into port, we were herded to the docking part where our luggage was being held. Everyone there was so sick, some people still puking. When we were on the ramp trying to get to land the ramp was constantly moving (very frightening). Luckily there was man at the end that grabbed my arm and helped me get to land.

I would look for other alternative ways to travel the islands.",April 2019,SeaJets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d6923012-Reviews-SeaJets-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,1.0,3.5
One of my Favorite Spots!,"We visited here in the beginning is April. It was drizzling when we arrived but by the time we started our tour the sun came out! Our tour guide Penny was AMAZING!! Truly one of the best we had on our whole trip. Learning about the oracles, Temple of Apollo, and views of Mount Parnassus was so fascinating.

Wear comfortable shoes! Lots of stairs and uneven terrain.",April 2019,Delphi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d523823-Reviews-Delphi-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
A Must Stop!,"Wow! This visit was amazing!! We were part of a tour group and had a private guide who walked us around and told us the history! We went in the beginning of April and we were told the cruise ships were just starting to come in. It was busy BUT not as busy as it typically is. I couldn’t imagine what that would have been like. Wear flat comfortable shoes, there was a lot of uneven pavement/gravel as well as a lot of stairs/ramps. When we were getting ready to walk out, it had started to sprinkle, so if it is raining or wet be careful. We saw a few people slip down stairs. There were stray dogs and cats everywhere all seemed very friendly and calm. A few people begging for money or selling touristy type items (gold crowns).

There is no bathroom once you get in so it is recommended to use the one outside before you go in. Ladies, this had a typical European toilet with no seat.

"Great Views, Drinks, and Food",We took the cables car up to this restaurant in April. The views alone were worth it. The food was really good! We enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. The waiter was helpful. I would recommend going back to this place. The menu had multiple options so finding something you might like would be really easy. The place did take credit cards.,April 2019,Sky Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d15060363-Reviews-Sky_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Nice Location-Great View for Breakfast/Dinner,"We stayed at this hotel in the beginning of April. It was not yet season for the many Tourist that come and visit Greece. First the location - it was a 10 min talk to the cable cars to see the top of Lycabettus Hill. Other restaurants were also in close distance. Hotel was clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel did exhange money which was nice perk. We had the daily breakfast brunch which was very good. Daily they had a range of different pastries, muffins, and breads along with multiple hot options such as fried eggs, bacon, different traditional greek cruisines. Coffee was good and the fresh juice was also enjoyable. The best part of the daily breakfast was the view.
The restaurant was on the 6th floor. We had great views of the acropolis. Our room was on the lower level and the view was of a wall. This was very disappointing. Even though we weren't planning on spending alot of time at this hotel, it would have been nice to have some sort of view. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom seemed to be recently remodeled. The other isue we experienced was with the air control. It was extremely stuffy in our hotel room. We had to sleep with the window wide open in order to get air circulating and the humidty out. Overall, I enjoyed this hotel and when I travel Greece again, I would look at staying at it again.",April 2019,St. George Lycabettus Lifestyle Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d198990-Reviews-St_George_Lycabettus_Lifestyle_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Price",We traveled over a Holiday Weekend and the prices seemed to be the best at this hotel. The rooms are updated and very clean and nice. Great location to walk around. A HUGE perk the hotel offers is a shuttle that can take you anywhere or pick you up in a 10-mile radius. This was great if you wanted to check out other areas but didn't necessarily want to walk straight to them. The state building is around the corner. It was also a quick walk (a few blocks) to great restaurants and 2nd ave which has a lot of great bars. The one negative is the speed of the elevators. We had to wait around 10 mins for an elevator to get to our floor we were on the 22nd and they had 5 elevators. Not sure if it was a glitch or not. It was quiet which was nice. I am a sensitive sleeper and need quiet. I couldn't hear our neighbors or the outside traffic. Would definitely stay at this hotel again next time I go to Nashville.,May 2018,Sheraton Grand Nashville Downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55229-d98224-Reviews-Sheraton_Grand_Nashville_Downtown-Nashville_Davidson_County_Tennessee.html,"Nashville, Tennessee",hotels,5.0,4.0
Okay Hotel - Needs updating,"We were looking for a place to stay in Gatlinburg that was clean and in a good location and we didn't want to spend a lot of money on. We found this hotel online. It is very outdated (expect the Keurig). The place was okay for what it was. A few things I noticed, the chair was stained and had a cigarette burn on it. Huge cracks in the ceiling. A few dead bugs on the walls. The bathroom was odd as our floor was extremely hot. We weren't sure what was causing the floor to be so warm. It did have views of the water but we only had one chair on our balcony so we didn't go out there. It did have parking but it was very tight. One night we came back and someone had parked in our spot. The manager on duty was very kind to give us his. The staff was friendly. Was in a pretty good location. There was a trolley spot right nearby. Walls were thin. You could hear your neighbors. Also someone must have been smoking cause one night we woke up and could smell it.",May 2018,Rocky Waters Motor Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60842-d97874-Reviews-Rocky_Waters_Motor_Inn-Gatlinburg_Tennessee.html,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",hotels,3.0,3.5
AMAZING Must stop for Pancakes,This place was recommended by a co-worker. We stopped for brunch. There was a line so I dropped my friend off while I went to look for a parking spot. They do not seat you until your whole party is there. I got chocolate pancakes and my friend got the morning star. Both were incredible. Staff was friendly. One negative is that it was a cash only restaurant and I didn't realize that till I went to pay.,May 2018,Pancake Pantry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60842-d523100-Reviews-Pancake_Pantry-Gatlinburg_Tennessee.html,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Wasn't sure at first..was actually VERY interesting,"We visited this place when it started to rain one day. I wasn't sure at first but as you travel through it, it was very interesting.

A MUST!!!!!,"We drove to this place each day we were in Gatlinburg. One day we actually went twice (in the morning and at dusk). Each time we went we saw bears, elk, coyotes, wild turkeys. It is a great scenic drive takes about 45mins-1 hour to get there from the main road. Once in Cades Cove, it is about a 1 hour if not longer to drive the loop. We got fantastic scenic photos as well as some animals pics. We happened to stop right by where a bear was and he crossed the road right behind us!

Nice Hotel in a great location,"I have stayed at this hotel multiple times. Most recently to evacuate from Hurricane Irma. While I was very glad they accommodated my pet, the rooms that are allowed to have animals were a little different then staying in another part of the hotel. Most of my stays here the staff has been very friendly and nice. The last time I was a little disappointed. Since the storm was making its way north, the hotel stopped serving food due to staff calling out. Nothing was communicated to us and when we called down to the front desk the manager was a little rude.
The location is in a great spot with nice restaurants near by.

St. Louis Cemetery Tour / Garden District Walking Tour - AMAZING,"We first did the St. Louis Cemetery tour with Hope. This was our official first day in New Orleans. Hope was AMAZING! She informed us of the history of New Orleans and gave us a great tour through the actual Cemetery. I HIGHLY recommend this tour. Before we started off on the tour, they supplied us with a free fan. I know this sounds silly but this by far was the BEST fan one could possibly have in July. This fan helped me survive the humid temperature for the remainder of my vacation! Because of the tour Hope gave we decided to use this company again and do the Garden District Walking Tour. AGAIN it was fantastic! Aubrey was our Tour guide and she also gave us a great tour between funny and interesting stories to the history of the Garden District. I highly recommend this tour as well. We took other tours with different tour groups while we were in New Orleans - BUT this was by far the BEST! Hope and Aubrey deserve major KUDOS!",July 2017,French Quarter Phantoms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60864-d1534151-Reviews-French_Quarter_Phantoms-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Option to see the City,We bought this due to using a similar system on another vacation. We unfortunately we didn't utilize it as much as we should. When we did ride on the bus the tour guides gave interesting facts and history of New Orleans. We bought a 3 day pass. We tried to a full loop on the bus so we could see all the stops. We did utilize it when we needed to get back to a certain area. All in all I highly recommend using this to get around and see the city.,July 2017,City Sightseeing New Orleans Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g60864-d11452469-City_Sightseeing_New_Orleans_Hop_On_Hop_Off_Bus_Tour-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",activities,4.0,4.0
A MUST spot to eat when in New Orleans,"I can not say enough GREAT things about our experience at the Court of Two Sisters. It wasn't just the delicious food but the service we received. Alan was by far the BEST server I have ever had. Because of him, our dinner was truly memorable. He made the Caesar Salad at our table as well as the Banana Fosters. We are still talking about our experience that night. Alan deserves major KUDOS from his managers. Because of him I will recommend this restaurant to anyone who may be going to New Orleans. The food was amazing. As someone who has been called a picky eater - I cleared my plate! haha! I had the Caesar salad, chicken oscar and the creme brule. Everything was perfect. The Nola punch also was amazing!",July 2017,The Court of Two Sisters,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60864-d463922-Reviews-The_Court_of_Two_Sisters-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",restaurants,5.0,4.0
A Delightful Treat,We had heard about the famous Cafe Du Monde as we were planning our trip. We stopped her twice! Make sure you plan according as the lines could get long. We only waited 10 mins for the first time and the second we got right in. The Beignet's were just as amazing as everyone says they are. The staff was on top of everything and very friendly.

A Great All Day Tour,"We did the all day tour that took us to boat ride through the bayou and a visit to 2 plantations, Oak Alley and the Laura Plantation. Kat was our driver/guide to all the destinations. She was wonderful! She gave us a great history of the areas were visiting as we drove to our destinations. Oak Alley was breathtaking. The lunch was good. I highly recommend these tours if you want to see what is beyond New Orleans.",July 2017,Tours by Isabelle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60864-d1012469-Reviews-Tours_by_Isabelle-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",attractions,5.0,4.5
Visited as part of the Tours by Isabelle,Renee was our tour guide. She was FANTASTIC!!! She truly made the visit memorable. She deserves major KUDOS from her managers. The stories she told us of the plantation were informative and interesting. I highly recommend this tour to learn more about the history of this state and this area.,July 2017,Laura: Louisiana's Creole Heritage Site,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g40470-d257573-Reviews-Laura_Louisiana_s_Creole_Heritage_Site-Vacherie_Louisiana.html,"Vacherie, Louisiana",attractions,5.0,4.5
Breathtaking 300+ yr old Oaks.,"The 300+ yr old oaks make the drive to the Plantation worth it. The tour of the history of this plantation was very informative. We enjoyed lunch at this spot as well which was also very good. We were part of a tour company visiting, but we had time to wonder though the property. This plantation was beautiful. The history behind it is heartbreaking but something everyone should visit.",July 2017,Oak Alley Plantation,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g40470-d105805-Reviews-Oak_Alley_Plantation-Vacherie_Louisiana.html,"Vacherie, Louisiana",attractions,5.0,4.5
A Must if you are in New Orleans,My whole group got tarot cards done. Two of us got tea leaves. The stuff she told me was very interesting. I have gone to many other tarot card/psychic readings before and she did mention some of the same things. If you like this type of thing then you must stop in and get a reading. The CD is an added perk!,July 2017,Bottom of the Cup Tea Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60864-d3916325-Reviews-Bottom_of_the_Cup_Tea_Room-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",attractions,5.0,4.0
Excellent Food in a charming building,We ended up visiting this place twice on our vacation. We have heard there is sometimes a line so get there early. Which is true. We got there and ate between 8-10. By 11 there was a line forming outside. The food was very good. My friends and I got different things both times we went and everything was amazing. We were very happy with our experience. This was also a quick 10 min walk from our hotel so that was also great!

Big Zombie Tour 3 - Awesome,"We did the Big Zombie Tour 3 on Sunday May 28th. Josh was our tour guide and Ricky Bobby was our driver! Both did a fantastic job. This was our second tour with both Atlanta Move Tours and Josh! It was awesome to hear inside stories from the set. Josh was always asking if we had questions and we played a fun trivia game while we drove from location to location. We visited Glenn's dumpster scene, the bridge in the finale of Season 6, multiple locations in Griffin; the food bank, carol's hideout, Abe's bridge and MANY more awesome locations. I can NOT say enough great things about this tour. I will definitely be on the look out for #hilltopjosh !!!!

I highly recommend this tour for anyone who is a walking dead fan!",May 2017,Atlanta Movie Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60898-d2646993-Reviews-Atlanta_Movie_Tours-Atlanta_Georgia.html,"Atlanta, Georgia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Amazing views when you get to the top!,We had no idea that there is such a beautiful park so close to ATL. We got to the park an hour after it was open and it was already BUSY! We did multiple hikes throughout the day. Remember bring WATER! Even if you think you don't need it .. you will :) There were other trails that you could drive to and hike from. It was an amazing experience.,May 2017,Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60874-d143186-Reviews-Kennesaw_Mountain_National_Battlefield_Park-Kennesaw_Georgia.html,"Kennesaw, Georgia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful Bakery and Delicious Treats!,"I had heard about this bakery through different Instagram profiles I follow. Since I was going to be in town, I decided we had to check it out. It did not disappoint! It was beautiful decorated inside and the staff were incredibly polite and helpful. After seeing the adorable Unicorn Macaroons, I had to order at least 2. As well as a box of 6 :) I also tried one of their Iced Chai Lattes. Everything was AMAZING!

Awesome Zombie Tour 1 - Atlanta,"This is a MUST if you are a fan of the walking dead! Josh was our tour guide and Clyde our driver. We got to stop and walk around different areas where they filmed, SO COOL! Josh gave great information not just about the walking dead but about other tv/movies that were currently being filmed or that were filmed in ATL. It was so interesting to hear first hand knowledge from them as they have been extras on multiple projects. We got to stop at multiple locations and see things we probably wouldn't have know about i.e the Goat Farm. That location was awesome just to walk around. One other thing I really enjoyed was that they should clips from the walking dead to show the the locations as they were filmed vs how they look now! I highly recommend this tour! We can't wait to plan our next trip to ATL so that we can go on the other tours this company has :)",October 2016,Atlanta Movie Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60898-d2646993-Reviews-Atlanta_Movie_Tours-Atlanta_Georgia.html,"Atlanta, Georgia",attractions,5.0,5.0
