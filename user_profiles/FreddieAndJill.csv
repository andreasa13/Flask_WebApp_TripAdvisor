The worst seafood,"We ate here for dinner one night and it was one of the worst, if not the worst, seafood dinners we have ever had. We ordered the special as a starter ‘6 prawns in garlic’ -the prawns were overcooked and mushy and an odd brown colour -needless to say we didn’t finish them and sent them back. Hoping the mains would be better we ordered the lobster (which was actually very small crayfish) and calamari. The crayfish was similar to the prawns and very overcooked and mushy and the fried calamari was soggy. We suspect that none of the seafood was fresh and was all frozen and very badly cooked by a terrible chef. We left without eating as the food was so bad (definitely a first for me!). There are not too many restaurants in town but avoid this one!",December 2019,Portuguese Fisherman,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g316112-d15614325-Reviews-Portuguese_Fisherman-Luderitz_Karas_Region.html,"Luderitz, Namibia",restaurants,1.0,4.5

Lovely local fish restaurant,Miller’s Thumb is a great local restaurant. We had the mussels and calamari to start then the kingklip and prawns- all of the seafood was well cooked and fresh. Simply cooked but excellent.

Huge disappointment,"The Acropolis is best viewed from afar. Up close, the place is a building site where they are rebuilding the monuments...! The columns have been rebuilt using a mis-match of materials and look terrible - I’m not sure why they haven’t left it all as was when excavated. As expected it’s a huge tourist trap and not an enjoyable experience. Also there are no facilities at the entrance so you have to walk all the way to to top to use the toilets - pretty bad for Athens top tourist attraction.

Fortunately we had a multi site ticket and the other lesser know sites were much better and enjoyable to visit.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,1.0,4.5
Excellent food,This local restaurant in an old school is a bit outside the centre of town however it is well worth the taxi ride. The food was excellent -traditional Greek with a modern twist.

Ruined by the service,"We booked a lunch for 4 people via email at 2pm. On arrival the restaurant was quite quiet. We ordered off the lunch set menu but were not given a wine list. After inquiring we were told it was on an iPad and the battery was low...(slightly bizarre excuse!). The waiter then recommend some pairing wines by the glass which we ordered. The food came out promptly and the time between courses was non existent. After the main we were told we had to order dessert straight away as the restaurant was now closed. No offer of any further drinks either.
Overall the food was lovely and would rate it 5 stars but our expectation of a long lunch over a nice bottle of wine was thwarted by the rushed service and basically being thrown out of the restaurant just after 3pm.
Why did they take a 2pm booking if they wanted to close early?!? Very disappointing.",March 2019,Atelje,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274873-d698786-Reviews-Atelje-Ljubljana_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Great morning SUP through the city,"We had a great paddle through the city with Spela. Being off season we had the river to ourselves which was lovely and peaceful. The weather was perfect and wetsuits were provided - this is not just a summer activity, would definitely recommend from now onwards.

Great cassoulet,"Although the restaurant decor hasn’t changed much since the 80’s it was quite charming and the food was worth it. The menu is limited but if you come here you must have the cassoulet -served in a big pot for the table, the portion sizes are huge! They have a very good inexpensive red wine list too.

Very Disappointing!,"This restaurant was our only disappointment while visiting Barcelona.
Both the restaurant and menu looked interesting, but unfortunately the food was ordinary and the service charmless.
The one star is based on the fact that we ordered an ice cream as dessert, this came in a tiny glass container, frozen absolutely solid, it needed an ice pick instead of a spoon, so of course we immediately pointed this out to the waitress (by the name of Sonia according to the bill), but she couldn’t or wouldn’t grasp the fact that it was inedible, she just kept repeating that it was ice cream! Finally she snatched up the ice cream and gave it to someone in the kitchen to thaw, five minutes later it came back in need of a straw rather than a spoon, just as inedible. No apology, no offer of an alternative dessert, not even the menu.",January 2019,Restaurante Tantarantana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d947706-Reviews-Restaurante_Tantarantana-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,1.0,4.0

Tourist trap,"We booked a driver from Kanchanaburi to take us to Hellfire pass. As we were then taking the train to Bangkok that afternoon, our hotel recommended the driver drop is at this station to catch the train so we could also see the bridge (rather than catch the train at Kanchanaburi). A word of warning, this is not really a train station but a tourist attraction. There were hundreds of tourists wanting to see the bridge/ the cave/ take the train a few stops. The area was full of stalls selling cheap goods. Overall not a pleasant experience waiting on the train here, plus when we did get on the train was packed until everyone got off at River Kwai. If you want to take the train to Bangkok would recommend getting on at Kanchanaburi and avoiding this place.",December 2018,Tham Kra Sae Bridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g15688339-d3342254-Reviews-Tham_Kra_Sae_Bridge-Lum_Sum_Sai_Yok_Kanchanaburi_Province.html,"Lum Sum, Thailand",attractions,1.0,4.0

Lovely kayaking trip but poor guide,"We booked the one day kayaking trip with Green Discovery on a joint tour however it was quiet and we were the only ones on the tour. The scenery for the majority of the kayaking was fantastic and the river very peaceful. However the last 5k or so wasn’t so great when the banks became populated with the river dirty and polluted and no scenery -in our view the trip should have ended before this point. But we’d still give the kayaking 4.5/5 stars.

However, the guide was very disappointing- he barely had any interaction with us, didn’t explain the trip at the start nor how to kayak (luckily we have kayaked many times before but if you hadn’t you would be struggling). During the trip he paddled either way in front of us or behind and didn’t really check if we were ok. Also at the end he jumped onshore and left us struggling to get out the boat up a very rocky embankment.

Overall, worth the trip for the kayaking and the scenery but Green Discovery need to do better with their guides for the price you are paying.",December 2018,Green Discovery Laos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g7741494-d9801292-Reviews-Green_Discovery_Laos-Thakhek_Khammouane_Province.html,"Thakhek, Laos",attractions,3.0,4.0

Visiting the cave and boat trip is a must!,"After reading the description in the guidebook, we weren’t convinced about visiting this cave, however as we had a spare day in Thahkek we decided to go. We are glad we did as it turned out to be the best cave we’ve ever seen. Entrance fee is 30,000 each and includes entry to the east side of the cave (not that amazing), however for a further 20,000 per person you can take the boat ride to the west side of the cave. This is a must!!! The boat ride is spectacular (700m) and once you get off the boat on the west side, the guide gave us a tour of the cave (about an hour and a bit walking) which was incredible. It was also super quiet and we were the only tourists there so we had the whole cave to ourself!
