Not worth it,"Will not go back again. I ordered a sandwich and the bread was stale, the chicken was dry and they added a sweet disgusting sauce. The orange juice was good. Next to me another person was complaining about the quality of the food too. He seem upset and didn’t have to pay for his food. Not worth it!",January 2020,Warung Pondok Madu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297701-d12391014-Reviews-Warung_Pondok_Madu-Ubud_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html,"Ubud, Indonesia",restaurants,2.0,4.5
It was quite average,"It was quite average. I had some Mexican style eggs and the tortillas were coated in oil as well as the meal. I had to ask the to change. Nothing compared to Mexican style eggs, very bland taste. There is a credit card fee too. The only nice this is the atmosphere, the place is lovely. I would go again but just for a beverage.",January 2020,Clear Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297701-d1758031-Reviews-Clear_Cafe-Ubud_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html,"Ubud, Indonesia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Great restaurant in Ubud.,"Great restaurant in Ubud. Staff was very friendly, our waitress Eka took really good care of us. The food was very tasty and they also have vegetarian options. Price is reasonable with special menu. Location is excellent across from Starbucks and close to the palace.",December 2019,White Orchid Ubud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297701-d10529149-Reviews-White_Orchid_Ubud-Ubud_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html,"Ubud, Indonesia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nothing special,We visited the chocolate bar and the menu looked promising however we ordered the hot chocolate and it was basic. The decor is very nice of the shop inside.,March 2019,Max Brenner Rothchild,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293984-d947291-Reviews-Max_Brenner_Rothchild-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html,"Tel Aviv, Israel",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Loved it,It was a pleasant surprise to visit the acropolis for FREE. Lots of walking and rocks are slippery but the views are wonderful.,March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great location but the photos are deceiving,"The hotel is located centrally and with walking fist to main attractions. The welcoming to the hotel was great however the facilities need work. The shower head was broken and instead of moving us to another room we had to wait a day for it to be fixed. In addition the safe box did not work, the carpet was dirty and the room was very small.

Breakfast was ok and people were nice. I would not stay here longer than two days.",March 2019,Astor Hotel Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d250578-Reviews-Astor_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,3.5
Good hotel but car service was horrible,"The good:
The airport pickup was fantastic, the hotel sent someone to pick us up and helped with the processing. The hotel has a currency exchange service which is very convenient, and multiple restaurants.

The bad:

five star hotel would be a 3 star in the U.S location is far from Cairo center. Booked a car trough the hotel to take us to the pyramids and our driver Mohammed took us to a tour person who told us that we needed to book a tour in order to get into the pyramids. We negotiated a price and when we came back we had to pay a lot more than the price we had agreed on. We paid because we(2 girls) were alone in a place where we didn’t know anyone. We also discovered that a tour was not necessary to visit Pyramids. Do Not use their car service!! It was the Worst experience ever.",March 2019,Concorde El Salam Hotel Cairo by Royal Tulip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294201-d301243-Reviews-Concorde_El_Salam_Hotel_Cairo_by_Royal_Tulip-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Cairo, Egypt",hotels,3.0,4.0

Tour arrived on time and was very accommodating and provided great service.",March 2019,Deluxe Travel Egypt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294201-d2557973-Reviews-Deluxe_Travel_Egypt-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Cairo, Egypt",attractions,5.0,5.0
It’s definitely not a 4 star level hotel,"I booked hotel with a third party website. The booking said I had 2 hour early check in. As I arrived at the hotel, the attendant said I had to wait to check in. I told the person, I had early check-in, he insisted it was not possible and I showed him my booking email, finally he got me checked in but service was blah. The attendant seemed to be bothered by me insisting on the reservation time and was not friendly. The room was tiny & had a layer of dirt per the picture attached. the bathroom extremely small and uncomfortable. The good, the hotels was clean, location was ok, the breakfast was basic, just a cold breakfast.

I would expect more from a 4 star Hotel",August 2018,Villa Bougainville by HappyCulture,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187234-d231041-Reviews-Villa_Bougainville_by_HappyCulture-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_.html,"Nice, France",hotels,3.0,4.0
Great location but poor hostel,"As soon as I arrived I was ready to check out. I arrived at night and was greeted by someone who had a thick accent and I could barely understand anything he said. Not his fault.. however when I get to the room there is only one bunk top bed available. The beds are the worst and they make so much noise and are very uncomfortable. I was put in a room with an older lady traveling with someone younger (hostel said there was an age limit) not true. The older lady was hiding the remote for AC and it was so uncomfortable, either too hot or too cold. Breakfast was included but it was really bad, some hard bread with bad coffee, & everyone was touching everything. The plus is the location and they kept rooms clean. The people were not friendly. I asked someone for directions and he was not helpful at all. If I was to redo trip I would stay somewhere else. I do not recommend it.",August 2018,Hotel Antares,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187234-d277277-Reviews-Hotel_Antares-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html,"Nice, France",hotels,2.0,3.5

Bad experience and slow service,"Visiting Amsterdam with a friend. This restaurant had a slow crew, we were hungry and waited forever to get our food. ordered the pad Thai, when I tasted the noodles they were sweet as if they had dropped the whole tamarind sauce on them. Which at the beginning I asked for spicy. I asked the waitress if they had any sauce, waitress brought chili powder, but nothing could help the noodles. I left the full plate and they still charged me the whole price, even as I told them how bad it was. Would not recommend, food was not good, and the service was even worse.",August 2018,Take Thai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188590-d697030-Reviews-Take_Thai-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Great brunch,Great food and great service! Would give a five star if the place was a bit more cozy a bit small. It's more like a cafe style.,March 2017,Nutmeg Bakery & Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d4836781-Reviews-Nutmeg_Bakery_Cafe-San_Diego_California.html,"San Diego, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Worst place ever,The work place I've ever stayed at. When I got to the place it was dirty unlike the pictures and old. I was too tired and wanted to take a shower and go to bed but place had no water. I had to check out which they were rude and difficult to get my money back. I was forced to look for a place to sleep at midnight. Location is fantastic but not worth it.,January 2017,Pirwa Posada del Corregidor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294314-d774866-Reviews-Pirwa_Posada_del_Corregidor-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html,"Cusco, Peru",hotels,1.0,3.5
