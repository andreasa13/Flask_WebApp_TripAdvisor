Whataburger on Friendswood Dive,"We've been to the Whataburger on North Friendswood Drive a couple of times during this spring. (We've been doing a lot of ""take-out"" during this Covid year.) While This Whataburger has the same great ""Whataburgers"" that the rest of the chain has to offer, for some reason, this location - with a single drive-thru lane - seems to be slower than the location at the other end of town. What a shame!
Still, it's a great burger and worth the wait. But if you can get the same burger, at the same price, much quicker, just by driving two miles down Friendswood Drive, well.....?",March 2021,Whataburger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55868-d476540-Reviews-Whataburger-Friendswood_Texas.html,"Friendswood, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Saturday Evening Dinner at Floyds Cajun Seafood,"We had dinner at Floyds Cajun Seafood in Pearland last Saturday - but it was almost Sunday morning breakfast time before we got finished. It was crowded as we would expect on a Saturday evening but the delay was really excessive. We were told 35 to 45 minutes wait when we checked in but we probably waited well over an hour and a half. After we were seated, and admittedly, there were 10 of us, there was a long delay in getting our orders and even longer in getting our meals. Our meals were served at various times so the first people who were served, were finished, or almost finished, with their meals before the last couple (us) were served our order. The waitress stated several times that they were very busy that night, but their parking lot is always that crowded on weekend nights. It should not have been anything unusual to the management and wait staff to see such a crowd.

Our meal was tasty and acceptable, a large serving as usual, but wed had to rush to eat it without being able to savor and enjoy it because our friends were finished already and ready to leave.
We hadn't been to Floyd's since before the Covid, and had never been unhappy with their service or meals before, but we were disappointed this time.",April 2021,Floyds Cajun Seafood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56432-d2253144-Reviews-Floyds_Cajun_Seafood-Pearland_Texas.html,"Pearland, Texas",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Burgers at JLB Eatery in Friendswood,"Several of our friends had spoken very highly of JLB Eatery, the new burger place in town, reporting that they were better than soado variations. There was one bacon burger on the menu, as I recal.me of the other local burger places, so we gave it a try last week.
We weren't disappointed, they were good, maybe very good, but not better than some of our other favorites in the area.

Their Burgers are larger with large fresh baked buns, but I felt that their menu lacked the variety of burger variations that our other favorite places offered. JLB mainly offered Burgers and burgers with avocado. There was one bacon burger as I recall. I'm a fan of mushrooms and swiss cheese but didn't notice any of those on the menu. (BTW: the menu is on the counter and posted above the ordering counter. I didn't see any that could be perused at leisure before approaching the counter to order.)

We ordered the Burger. It was big, very big and so was the bun, but the large patty didn't want to stay together and was crumbling into pieces as I was eating it. Although the tomatoes on the burger were fresh and crisp and tasty, the burger was smothered in shredded lettuce which didn't make my day. (Leaf lettuce would have been preferable.) The fries were very tasty and enjoyable.

JLB might be undergoing opening & growing pains and we will certainly be returning, but for the time being, we won't be making them our No. 1 Favorite Burger place as yet.

Try JLB Eatery out for yourself and see what you think. I'm sure you won't be disappointed - but you probably won't be ecstatic either!",April 2021,Jlb Eatery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55868-d23316335-Reviews-Jlb_Eatery-Friendswood_Texas.html,"Friendswood, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Jersey Mike's Subs in Friendswood.,"Several people had told us good things about the new Jersey Mike's Subs in Friendswood, so we gave it a try and have now been there several times.

While their ""subs"" are good and enjoyable, their real strength, in my mind, are their ""Philly Cheese Steak Sandwiches"" which I think are ""GREAT"". (I haven't yet tried the chicken variety, because why tamper with success?) Suitably gooey and juicy, I think they are better than any around the whole area, and highly recommend them.

Dinner at The Yard House,"We stopped by The Yard House at Baybrook Mall in Friendswood, on a recent Saturday evening for dinner with a group of our friends. Having called ahead for a table, our waiting time was not very long and better than we expected.
The food was very good and our choices were very satisfying. I chose the Whiskey Glazed Salmon which was excellent as were the accompanying Herb Mashed Potatoes. The included vegetables, broccoli and carrots weren't quite as successful. All under-cooked, almost raw, they presented a challenge to cut to bite-size even with a knife.
My Wife selected the Orange Chicken which she found spicy and tasty, and enjoyable.
A couple of down-sides: The restaurant was fairly crowded when we arrived and very loud and noisy. Even after the crowd thinned out later in our meal, the noise level did not seem to abate. Our group had to speak loudly, even shout, to hear each other. The other thing was the menu situation. Possibly because of covid considerations, there were no food menus on the tables (although there were paper bar menus on every table?) and order selection had to be done either from a cranky down-loaded on-line menu or from a tabletop laptop unit passed from hand to hand. Unfortunately the on-line menu was not accurate and did not coincide with the tabletop unit.
A minor inconvenience occurred with our ordering in that the waitstaff insisted on having one person take orders from one side of the long table and a second waiter taking orders from the other side of the table. Since our group always sits with Ladies on one side, Men on the other side, this was somewhat inconvenient and we were expecting a mish-mash when the separate checks arrived. Luckily, the checks seem to have been all correct.
A good place to visit and we plan to return'",March 2021,Yard House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55868-d9606438-Reviews-Yard_House-Friendswood_Texas.html,"Friendswood, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Covid Take-Out From Maggiano's in Friendswood,"About a week ago, during the Covid pandemic, we ordered take-out from Maggiano's and were very well pleased with the outcome. The meal was tasty and delicious and well enjoyed. Despite a 15 - 20 minute drive home from the restaurant, our meal was still nice and hot when we got home to eat (and enjoy) it.
It wasn't quite the same as the excellent dining that we have had actually eating at the restaurant, but there was no difference in the food and quality. Even the left-overs heated up well and were great!

I had the Tuscan Shrimp and Chicken (which is my favorite item on their menu.); while my Wife had the Gnocchi and Sausage. Both ordered entrees were very good and did not disappoint us in any way.

The wait-staff girl got quite a work-out to deliver our order. It took three trips out to my car in order to: (1) Find out my name; (2) Deliver our order; and (3) Return my credit card and receipt. It would be a help for the staff if Maggiano's would take my credit card info over the phone; or alternately, give the take-out delivery staff a mobile/remote crfedit card terminal to bring to the car at curbside.",August 2020,Maggiano's Little Italy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55868-d10026549-Reviews-Maggiano_s_Little_Italy-Friendswood_Texas.html,"Friendswood, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Dinner at The Bothy Restaurant and Bar in Fort Augustus,"On my trip to Fort Augustus last year, I visited The Bothy Restaurant and Bar in Fort Augustus. I enjoyed my visit and my meal despite the fact that The Bothy was very busy and crowded that evening. While I waited to be seated in the restaurant section, I enjoyed the comfort and features of the bar.
The bar area of the Bothy appears to be the original - and quite charismatic - section of the Bothy and the restaurant section, which is obviously a later addition to the facility, is more modern and lacks a lot of the charm and uniqueness of the bar area.
Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time in both sections and my meal was tasty and enjoyable with good, friendly service (which was also true of the bar staff).

The Bothy Restaurant and Bar is located Canalside right on the corner with the main street in Fort Augustus. It is a very convenient location for travellers and visitors to Fort Augustus.",September 2019,The Bothy Restaurant and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551810-d1516176-Reviews-The_Bothy_Restaurant_and_Bar-Fort_Augustus_Loch_Ness_Region_Scottish_Highlands_Sc.html,"Fort Augustus, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Travel through Scotland with ScotRail,"Last year, I did all my travel to and from hiking The Great Glen Way - all my travel within Scotland, that is - on ScotRail. It was a pleasant experience and each ScotRail trip was enjoyable and efficient. The ScotRai trains are clean and neat, the staff efficient and helpful, and the facilities are comfortable.

"The Ness Bridge on Bridge Street, Inverness","The Ness Bridge on Bridge Street in Inverness is located in the very center and heart of Inverness. During my last one day stay in Inverness, in only one day, I must have passed over the Ness Bridge at least a half dozen times getting to places on either side of the River Ness. That speaks to how centrally The Ness Bridge is located. Having separate pedestrian sidewalks over the bridge, which safely protected all of the pedestrians from the (evil) motorized traffic, the walkways provide excellent viewing locations all along the transit of the bridge across the river. A stop in the very center of the Ness Bridge for a good long view up and/or down the River Ness, is almost an obligatory ritual. It is a great photo spot and very suited to those ""Kodak Moments"".

Inverness Castle,"The Inverness Castle seemed to me to be the most significant landmark in all of Inverness. Centrally located, and perched well above the River Ness and the center of Inverness, this impressive structure is very grand and stately as it surveys all below in its domain. A trip or visit to Inverness would not be complete without a visit to The Inverness Castle and a long view from its high bulwarks overlooking the River Ness and the city itself.
The Inverness Castle is also the northern terminus of The Great Glen Way so all GGW hikers are excited and pleased as they hurriedly make their way onto the Inverness Castle grounds on the completion of their hike.",September 2019,Inverness Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186543-d8180365-Reviews-Inverness_Castle-Inverness_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Inverness, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,3.5
The Inverness Railway Station,"The Inverness Railway Station marked the start of my long trip home from my hike of The Great Glen Way. The Inverness Railway Station is conveniently located near to the center of Inverness so it was quite easy for me to walk to the station upon my departure from Inverness (and avoid the cost and hassle of getting a cab during morning traffic).

The Inverness Railway Station has a large inside lobby, which could have used more seating capability, and which was filled with travellers waiting for their trains to Glasgow, Edinburgh, and other locations. Information boards, signs, and attendants are conveniently available and there is no problem finding your
way to the correct gate at the proper time.",September 2019,Inverness Railway Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186543-d9811094-Reviews-Inverness_Railway_Station-Inverness_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Inverness, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.0
The Ness Islands,"The Ness Islands in the River Ness in Inverness are very beautifully landscaped and decorated into one of the most unique and attractive park settings that I have ever seen. Stretching for somewhere near a quarter of a mile in length and linked by a series of attractive and well maintained foot bridges, they were a delight to walk through and must be dear to the local Inverness residents' hearts. Walking through The Ness Islands was very meaningful for me as they are located almost to the north end of The Great Glen Way which, when I reached the park islands, signified that my long trek was almost complete. I couldn't think of a nicer, or more lovely way to come almost to the end of the hike.",September 2019,Ness Islands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186543-d14892430-Reviews-Ness_Islands-Inverness_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Inverness, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5

However, it was crowded and busy that evening, and being a single, I was crammed into a very small table for one right near the entrance to the kitchen area. Still, I was pleased that they were able, and willing, to seat me. The food was good and tasty and the service friendly and welcoming.

Ardross Glencairn B&B Guesthouse in Inverness,"The Ardross Glencairn B&B / Guesthouse is well located only a couple of blocks (5 minutes) from the very center of Inverness and fairly close to the actual end of The Great Glen Way at Inverness Castle. I stayed there last year upon the completion of my hike of The Great Glen Way and it suited my needs perfectly. It was close, convenient, comfortable and close to many restaurants and eating places, as well as to the railroad station.

The Ardross Glencairn B&B is situated in three buildings - all next to each other - #'s 17, 18, and 19 Ardross Street. The exterior looked to me like a row of renovated flats (but well renovated and maintained very well); while my impression of the insides of the buildings were that they looked like remodeled apartment buildings. The Reception and Breakfast Room is at #19 Andross.

I had room #45 which was on the 2nd floor of #17. It was a very adequate room, just fine for a solo hiker like myself. The room had a full-size bed (with a white duvet and 4 pillows), two night stands, a small desk/counter and chair, an barrel-back chair, a small TV on a shelf, and a hanging wardrobe area. There were two wall sconces above the head of the bed and one overhead light (with the switch by the door to the room). The window of the room overlooks the rear roof and eaves of some other building - not really a ""view"". The room did have a coffee kettle and fixings (including decaf) and cookies, a luggage rack, and hair dryer. There were several available electrical outlets for chargers.

The bathroom was a bit small with a sliding door and a small square shower in the corner. The shower head and spray was good but the shower was so small that I kept banging my elbows while showering. The bathroom sink had separate Hot and Cold faucets and handles. Two towels and liquid soap were provided, but not bar soap, wash cloths, or boxed tissues. Both the bathroom light and powered vent were operated with a pull string.

There was no phone in the room and the only phone - limited to calling Reception - was located in the 1st floor entryway.

The staff at Reception on the several times I went there for assistance, advice, and directions, were very friendly and helpful making interactions with them quite enjoyable.

The Ardross Glencairn B&B was very convenient for me and I'd be pleased to return there again.

A Night at The Kilmore Farmhouse in Drumnadrochit,"Last year while walking north on The Great Glen Way, I stopped for the night at The Kilmore Farmhouse B&B in Drumnaradchit. The Kilmore Farmhouse is located just outside the center of the town, but about 1/2 mile or so off the path of The Great Glen Way - which is just a bit far after a 14-1/2 to 15 mile day. It was a pleasant, quiet location on the outer edge of a nice residential section with the fields and hills just beyond the B&B.

Kilmore Farmhouse has a nice and comfy lounge available to the guests on the ground floor next to the breakfast room.

I had Room #2, on the ground floor, with a view to the barn/sheds at the rear of the property. The room was furnished with two twin beds (each with white duvets, two pillows and one throw pillow), one night stand and lamp, a vanity/desk (with a mirror and stool), a medium sized TV on the wall, an overhead fluorescent lamp (that was slow coming to full brightness) with the control switch by the door to the room. The room had a hanging clothes/bag frame with good hangers and a luggage rack. It had a coffee kettle with fixings including decaf and cookies/biscuits and chilled water.

The large-ish sized bathroom had a large rectangular shower stall with a ""point-of-use water heater and a good spray head/nozzle.The sink had a single lever faucet and a heated towel rack. An assortment of toiletries, bar soap, boxed tissues, and towels (two bath and one face towel) were provided.
Dinner was not served at The Kilmore Farmhouse but was available at a nice, stately restaurant (whose name I can't remember) just around the corner and about one block away from the B&B.

I would say that The Kilmore Farmhouse was the best place to stay in the area - particularly for a GGW hiker.

Craik Na Dav B& B in Invermoriston,"Last year, during my hike of The Great Glen Way, I stayed one night at the Craik Na Dav Bed and Breakfast in Invermoriston. I would have been very pleased to have stayed there several more nights because I was met and greeted with such inviting hospitality and warmth that it was a real pleasure to be there. Owner/Host Sisters Lindsey and Manda could not have been more welcoming or gracious. And the Lounge at Craik Na Dav is so comfortable and relaxing after a day's hike as to be perfect for the tired hiker or traveler. Coffee or tea and biscuits greeted the arriving visitors. It was a great place to get out of the rain.

Craik Na Dav is located about 1/10 mile off the path of The Great Glen Way, just uphill from the larger, and more noticeable Glenmoriston Arms Hotel. It is very convenient for any GGW hikers - and even more convenient for anyone with their own (not foot-powered) transportation.

I was given Room ""Oak"" for the night which was on the first floor. The room had two single beds (two pillows on each bed), a night stand and lamp, a chest, a clothes vanity (but no wardrobe closet), and a small TV mounted on the wall. There was an overhead lamp with the switch by the door of the room, and a couple of extra available wall outlets. A coffee urn and fixings (including decaf) and a hair dryer were available in the room.

The bathroom was large with a nice shower (with a single lever operating faucet). There was two towels, and a washcloth, but no bar soap.

Dinner was not served on the B&B premises, but was available just down the road at a couple of restaurants/cafes in Invermoriston.

A great place to stay and relax.

A Walk Along The Caledonian Canal,"Through the years, in my career as a Seafarer, I've traveled through most of the world's major canals on my ship. Last year when I hiked The Great Glen Way, was my first opportunity to walk along the length of a Canal. I found The Caledonian Canal to be a smaller-sized version of the large canals that I was most familiar with. On several of the days when I walked along the Canal in good weather, I was intrigued with the peacefulness and beauty of the canal and the adjoining countryside.

The Holt Canalside in Fort Augustus,"The Holt Canalside occupies a convenient location in Fort Augustus: It is located right on the canal adjacent to the top lock, it is only about one long block from the very center of Fort Augustus, and for my (or any hiker's) purposes, it is located right on the path of The Great Glen Way. It is actually down a little driveway, and sort of behind and between the buildings that front the street and canal. The River Oichy is to the rear of the property.

I had Room #2 which was of rectangular shape with a window on the side of the room overlooking an overgrown hillside (probably the embankment of the old railroad route) and a bathroom window that overlooked the River Oichy and the pillar supports of the abandoned railroad bridge crossing the river.

Room #2 had a single bed (with a white duvet and two pillows), two night stands and one lamp, a wardrobe cupboard with good hangers, one overstuffed barrel-back chair, a small TV on the wardrobe, an overhead lamp (with the switch by the door to the room), and a stand-up lamp, and a mirror. There was a coffee kettle with fixings including decaf.

The bathroom was just large enough for one. The sink had separate Hot and Cold water faucets; but the shower stall was nice with a good shower head and controls. There was bar soap and wash cloths, and boxed tissue.

No dinners are served at The Holt; but a nice breakfast was served in the conservatory overlooking the rear of the property and the River Oichy.

One small disappointment with The Holt was that I arrived in Fort Augustus early, at 12 noon, after hiking all morning in the rain. Knowing that ""Check-In"" time was 4 PM, I wandered around Fort Augustus, killing time, and still out in the rain. At 3 PM, having overstayed my welcome in the local cafe and a pub, I called the Holt to ask about arriving early - and was told that I would have to wait until 4 PM, still an hour away. Certainly, the Holt's owners were very friendly and hospitable when I arrived at 4 PM, but the inconvenience of waiting 4 hours out in the rain did not make me feel very good initially.",September 2019,The Holt B&B,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g551810-d1775362-Reviews-The_Holt_B_B-Fort_Augustus_Loch_Ness_Region_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Fort Augustus, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,5.0
Forest Lodge Guest House in South Laggan,"I stayed at the Forest Lodge Guest House in South Laggan one night last year while I was hiking The Great Glen Way. The Forest Lodge Guest House is a Very, Very nice place but it was about a half mile or so from the path of the Great Glen Way. Ordinarily, that wouldn't be too far to go for a nice bed; but after a day of steady rain, any extra distance to the lodgings was just too far.
However, upon my arrival, soaking wet and bedraggled, I was overcome with welcome and hospitality from the owners. Lorraine and Laura could not have been any more welcoming and inviting and hospitable. They were probably the very best hosts that I encountered on my two week trip along the WHW and GGW.

The Forest Lodge Guest House was really well laid out with an efficient and practical vestibule, a welcome sunroom with TV, lounge, a large and comfy dining room and an ""honor shop"". Coffee and tea was available in the lounge. The sunroom had numerous puzzles and looks and other entertainment features.

My room was very adequate and comfortable but slightly more basically furnished. It had two twin beds, a three-drawer night stand and lamp, a small desk/vanity with stool, and a luggage rack. There was a coffee kettle/urn with coffee fixings (including decaf) on the vanity. The bathroom was slightly small but well arranged and with a shower stall and head that were fine. There were two towels and washcloths but no bar soap. The bathroom sink had separate Hot and Cold water valves and faucets.

The Forest Lodge Guest House served a dinner (on request) that was very good (Spaghetti Bolognese and Salad and warm Ginger Cake) It was delicious (and the only place in town!)

Riverside Lodge Gardens B&B in Gairlochy-Spaen Bridge,"I stayed a night at the Riverside Lodge Gardens B&B in Gairlochy-Spaen Bridge last year when I was hiking the Great Glen Way.

That would have been an inconvenient distance at the end of a day's hike except for the very convenient pick-up and transfer provided by the B&B owners who met me right at the Gairlochy Locks and drove me to the B&B returning me back to the trail in the morning. A very welcome and appreciated service!
The Riverside Lodge Gardens is situated on the banks of one of the local rivers and while the front yards and gardens are very carefully landscaped and maintained - quite attractive -, the back yard stretching to the river has been left to run wild and natural back to the river.
The Riverside Lodge Gardens is close to the restaurant(s) and facilities of Spaen Bridge which are just a one block stroll down the shady lane.

All of the rooms in the Riverside Lodge Gardens B&B are on the ground floor. (Only the breakfast room is located on the 2nd floor.) I had Room ""T"" situated in the back right corner of the B&B with a view towards the river which is down the bank and out of sight. The room had two comfortable twin beds (with white duvets and a total of 4 pillows and 7 throws).There were two night stands with lights, a small dresser, 2 barrel-back overstuffed chairs, a large wardrobe closet with two poles and ""good"" hangers, and a small TV in the corner. A coffee urn/kettle was provided along with coffee fixings including decaf coffee, and bottled water. There was an overhead light (with the switch by the door to the room) and several available electrical outlets (via a power strip). The radiator in the room did not appear to be working or operable.
The bathroom was quite roomy with a large shower with fancy multiple shower heads. It had a nice slate floor and a heated towel rack with plush towels and face cloths. No bar soap was provided.
The Riverside Lodge Gardens was a very nice place to stay and I enjoyed my visit there.

Old Fort Williams,"As I was leaving Fort Williams, I took the opportunity to visit the Old Fort Williams which was situated right at the beginning of the Great Glen Way in Fort Williams.
Although, there is not too much left of the original old fort, the remaining wall and parapets and the marked outline of the perimeter of the Old Fort show how large and impressive the structure must have originally been.

The Seated Sculpture,"The Seated Man Sculpture located on High Street in Fort Williams was very meaningful and poignant for myself and my hiking partner as it is located at the very end terminus of The West Highland Way which we completed walking as we strode past the sculpture to the adjacent WHW terminus marker.

The Bronze Model T in Fort Williams,"The Bronze Model T in Cameron Square on High Street in Fort Williams was very interesting. It is a bronze replica of a Model T auto that was driven to the top of Ben Nevis.

Neptune's staircase,"I visited and viewed the Neptune's Staircase while hiking The Great Glen Way. Located a short walk from Fort Williams on the Caledonia Canal, The Devil's Staircase is a fascinating series of locks in a short distance along the Canal.
It was very interesting to see, especially for a retired Seafaring person like myself.

The Garrison Bistro,"The Garrison Bistro is located in the Garrison Hotel in Fort Williams.
I had a Very Good dinner there that I quite enjoyed with a very tasty Shepherds Pie along with a Gin & Tonic (or two). However, and quite unfortunately, the bar was completely out of all local ales and beers! How could that be?

The Garrison in Fort Williams,"The Garrison Hotel in Fort Williams was perfectly located for my purposes, just ending a hike of the West Highland Way and due to begin hiking The Great Glen Way early the next morning. The Garrison, formerly a city jail (with some unconverted cells still bookable) is located just one block from the end of The West Highland Way on a pedestrian street that appears to be the central business/shopping street in Fort Williams. The railroad and bus stations are just a short walk away along with most of the local attractions.

The Garrison seemed to be recently renovated and new. I had room #109 on the first floor which was a nice room with three windows overlooking the parking area and street in front of the hotel. A glimpse of the river was visible between the buildings opposite. There is a lift from the front entrance to the reception area on the next level up. The staff, both at reception and the bar/restaurant staff were very helpful and friendly.

Room 109 was a nice room with a darkish modern decor. The room had a full-size bed with a white duvet, 4 pillows and two throw pillows; two night stands with wall lights over them; a vanity/desk and one straight-back chair; and a medium-size TV on the wall over the desk. There is a large makeup mirror on the vanity and a safe in the night stand. There are no hooks and only four hangers, which limits the ability to dry hiking clothes on a rainy day. There are several extra electrical outlets for chargers, etc. and a phone in the room; along with a coffee urn and fixings including decaf coffee and tea. A hair dryer and bathrobes are provided.

The bathroom was small but well designed and laid out. It had a tiny sink and a good shower. There was a small assortment of toiletries, boxed tissues, and bar soap but no wash cloths.

The bar and restaurant were on the ground floor near reception. My dinner meal was very good - Shepherd's Pie with Gin & Tonics. Unfortunately, the bar was all out of all local ales and beers. Breakfast was rather so-so: the service was slow and the selection fair but rather limited.",September 2019,The Garrison,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186545-d14177879-Reviews-The_Garrison-Fort_William_Lochaber_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Fort William, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,3.5
The Highland Getaway Restaurant,"While staying at The Highland Getaway Inn, I ate at The Highland Getaway Restaurant in the Inn. It was very convenient (although my room was in a separate building and it was raining both at check-in and at dinner time) and close enough to my room's building.
The restaurant had a very comfortable and inviting bar area furnished with lounge chairs and sofas.
The food was good. I enjoyed a nice Cottage Pie with Garlic Bread and lubricated with a pleasant Gin & Tonic.",September 2019,Highland Getaway Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551918-d4007280-Reviews-Highland_Getaway_Restaurant-Kinlochleven_Lochaber_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Kinlochleven, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
The Highland Getaway Inn,"We stayed at The Highland Getaway Inn while passing through Kinlochleven while hiking the West Highland Way.

It was very conveniently located to the trail in the center of the town and suited our needs very well. The Highland Getaway was a very nice Inn and the room was exceptional although the check-in and reception area looked - from the outside - to be just a corner bar.However, Room #10, located in an adjacent building like a small apartment was very charming and quite comfortable. The most notable feature was the double French doors that opened onto a large patio deck overlooking the river with a great view of the mountain/hill on the other side of the river.

The room had two twin beds each with two pillows and two throws per bed; two nightstands; a desk/vanity with a stool; two barrel-back chairs; and a small TV mounted on the wall. The room did have a coffee urn and fixings but no decaf coffee. There was a box of tissues. There were at least ten electrical outlets available for chargers, etc.; and good lighting from an overhead light and various wall sconces.

The bathroom was fair sized with a shower stall. The sink had separate Hot and Cold water faucets - somewhat dated. There were four big white fluffy towels, shampoo and conditioner, bar soap but no wash clothes. The light over the bathroom sink was burned out or inoperative.

The Highland Getaway had a nice bar area furnished with comfortable lounge chairs and sofas. Dinner was served there in the restaurant as well as upstairs in the breakfast room. Breakfast, however, was served at 10:00 AM - very late for a hiker.

The bathroom ventilator was anemic and there were no smoke alarms.",September 2019,Highland Getaway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g551918-d625826-Reviews-Highland_Getaway-Kinlochleven_Lochaber_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Kinlochleven, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Clachaig Inn Restaurant,"We ate at the Clachaig Inn Restaurant when we stayed there last year while hiking the West Highland Way.
Meals were served in the Inn's two bars and all ordering was done at the bar with no table service. All rather casual and informal but the food was very good and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the Smoked Haddock with mashed and sweet potatoes and found it delicious and very satisfying. My hiking partner, who ordered the ""kid's"" spaghetti, said it was the best meal that he had all week.
The restaurant at the Clachaig Inn would be worth going to, even if it wasn't the only restaurant on the grounds or in the immediate area.",September 2019,Clachaig Inn Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g656902-d4601472-Reviews-Clachaig_Inn_Restaurant-Glencoe_Village_Glencoe_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Glencoe Village, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
The Devil's Staircase,"The Devil's Staircase on Thhe West Highland Way looks very formidable on the trail maps. In reality, I didn't find it either that steep, or as twisty as represented on the maps.
It was a nice hike up and over; and the views along the way, and especially from the summit, were very nice.
This section of the WHW was very crowded, mostly with dayhikers and locals; but not unbearably so. I did pass many people on the ascent - which is normally not my standard - but I was intent on avoiding a potential rain storm if possible.
The summit is rather obvious but there is no permanent marking of the summit.",September 2019,Devil's Staircase,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315998-d12713629-Reviews-Devil_s_Staircase-Ballachulish_Glencoe_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Ballachulish, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
Clachaig Inn in Glencoe,"Last year - long before the pandemic and health restrictions - I stayed at the Clachaig Inn for one night while hiking The West Highland Way. Although not on the West Highland Way, making a shuttle ride from the trail to the Clachaig Inn necessary, the shuttle ride was convenient and painless so the distance from the Clachaig Inn to the WHW turned out to be inconsequential. The Inn is located on the outskirts of Glencoe and is conveniently located nearby to all of the outdoor activities of the area.

The Clachaig Inn is an interesting resort center, rather rustic and unassuming, but withB&B rooms, and self-cateringcabins, and, I think, both camping and bunkhouses. I had room #19 which was located in an outside addition building rather than in the original main building. Room #19 - and any room in that building - had a gorgeous view out the front window and/or the door across the parking lot to the majestic mountain just across the way. The view was worth the cost of the night's stay. My hiking partner was given a second floor room in the original building which didn't have such an impressive view.

Room #19 had a door opening onto an outside walkway which bordered the parking area along the front of the building. It had a full size bed with a white duvet and four pillows; two night stands with a lamp on each and reading lamps on either side of the bed.; a small desk and chair; an open wardrobe closet; medium size TV mounted on the wall in the corner; a radiator; 10 electrical outlets (all accessible to a normal human). There was no fan in the room; but there was a coffee urn and fixin's including decaf coffee along with cookies.
The bathroom was fairly roomy with a square shower stall in the corner with a good point-of-use water heater. The sink had separate hot and cold water faucets. There was a water glass but no wash clothes or boxed tissue; and only one small (but nice) bar of soap.
The staff was very helpful and friendly throughout my stay both at the desk and in the restaurant and bars. Although normal check-in time is at 4 PM, since we had arrived at 12:50, we were allowed into our rooms at 3 PM.
The included breakfast was served rather late for hikers - starting at 8:15 - but this was not inconvenient for us as our shuttle ride pickup was scheduled for 9 AM.

The Clachaig Inn has two bars where the restaurant meals are served. All ordering is done at the bar with no table service. My meal was very tasty and I enjoyed it. I had the Smoked Haddock with mashed and sweet potatoes. My hiking partner had the spaghetti and thought it was the best meal that he had all week.

The Clachaig Inn is definitely a place to stay if in the Glencoe area or while hiking The West Highland Way.",September 2019,Clachaig Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315998-d195065-Reviews-Clachaig_Inn-Ballachulish_Glencoe_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Ballachulish, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Dinner at The Bridge Of Orchy Hotel.,"While staying at the Bridge of Orchy Hotel, I had dinner at The Bridge of Orchy Hotel Restaurant. I think this was the only place to eat in the village, but regardless it was the most convenient place for me to eat and I can't imagine anywhere in the area being nicer or more inviting than the hotel's restaurant.
The restaurant is one large, elegantly decorated room, with, on this rainy day, a nicely laid fire in the fireplace. The restaurant was not crowded (unlike the more popular (and crowded) bar and sunroom on the lower level that served exactly the same menu)..
The food was very good. For dinner, I had an excellent meal of Blade of Beef, mash and Lyonnaise potatoes, and cauliflower, followed by a brownie, and with a pint or two. It was very well prepared, tasty, and satisfying. At lunch in the bar, I had had a Salmon, Dill & Cucumber Sandwich with Irish Coffee - also very tasty (and also available in the main restaurant).",September 2019,Restaurant at The Bridge of Orchy Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1096500-d1571623-Reviews-Restaurant_at_The_Bridge_of_Orchy_Hotel-Bridge_of_Orchy_Argyll_and_Bute_Scotland.html,"Bridge of Orchy, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Bridge of Orchy Hotel,"The Bridge of Orchy Hotel is located in the small village of Bridge of Orchy. The Bridge of Orchy is located immediately adjacent to the backside of the hotel. More importantly, for my purposes, the Hotel is located right on the West Highland Way. Very convenient for a wet and tired hiker arriving midday after a morning of rain. Unfortunately, the hotel felt obliged to maintain the stated 3 PM check-in time despite our much earlier arrival; but they did supply a residents lounge on the lower level for us to wait in until the proper time.

The Hotel is a very elegant looking, stately hotel in the center of the tiny village and very near to the train station.. Room #34 and most (if not all) of the rooms were located in the much newer and more modern additions located at the back and side of the main building. The main lobby, reception area, restaurant, bar and residents lounge were all located in the main building.

Room #34 was very nicely decorated in modern decor with a full-size (king?) bed(two twins pushed together).There was a desk and chair and two armchairs with a small TV mounted on the wall in the corner. The sliding door/windows opened out onto a small patio in a park-like setting of the grounds next to the hotel. There was a phone in the room and a coffee kettle with fixings including decaf coffee and biscuits.
The bathroom had a corner shower with a good head and controls and a heated towel rack. There was boxed tissues available but no bar soap or wash clothes. There were 4 big fluffy towels provided.
The restaurant bar was very busy and lively with an attached sunroom which was quite cool on this rainy day. The bar and sunroom served the same food items that were available in the larger, more formal restaurant on the main floor. However, the main restaurant, grander and more stately, had a fireplace going throughout the day.
It was a nice stay and worth a return trip.

Dinner at The Tyndrum Inn,"On my one night stay in Tyndrum while hiking The West Highland Way, I dined at The Tyndrum Inn which was very attractive and appealing looking. It was nice. As I remember, the main dining room was closed that day and all meals were being served in the bar and on the covered and semi-enclosed patio. The covered patio - which we had chose because the bar was crowded, noisy, and too warm - was quite pleasant but also very warm when the direct sun shone through the glass windows directly on you.
I don't remember what I ordered to eat, but it was evidently tasty and welcome along with a cold libation or two, or I would have noted a deficiency.
The Tyndrum Inn is located in the center of Tyndrum, nearly adjacent to the main intersection, and just feet away from the West Highland Way.

"Clifton Cottage in Tyndrum, Scotland","I stayed one night last August at The Clifton Cottage in Tyndrum, Scotland while hiking The West Highland Way. It was perfect for me! Clifton Cottage is located right on the WHW. A hiker only has to walk from the street (which is the WHW) up a few feet on the driveway to the front door when they arrive, tired after a long day, at Tyndrum. Dining place(s) are located about one block away at the nearby intersection. A small convenience store is also located at the same corner.

The Clifon Cottage's Husband and Wife Owners (Tam and Carmen) are very welcoming and hospitable. Carmen had welcomed us to Clifton Cottage on our arrival and got us situated. She couldn't have been more gracious and inviting! We didn't see Tam until breakfast but we ""sort of"" met him the afternoon and evening before through his extensive information books and local data that he had made up for their guests. I stayed up much later than I should have in order to read more of his material. It was great!

The Clifton Cottage - their home - has only a few rooms and we were very fortunate to have been booked there and able to spend the night with them. I had Room #4 which was a very spacious upstairs dormer room whose sloping ceiling had a skylight on either side (facing the front and the rear of the property). The room had two twin beds, three night stands and lamps, a table and chairs, wardrobe chest and side cabinets. There was a large TV on a table and two coffee makers with fixings (but no decaf coffee). There was a nice selection of cookies and pastry waiting to welcome us on our arrival. The lighting was good with overhead LED lights, lamps on each nigh stand, and the two skylights.

The bathroom was very nice and well laid out for the dormer space but just a little tight above the sink (due to the slope of the ceiling/roof). Not a problem for me, but might be for a taller person. The shower stall had a ""point-of-use"" water heater and was nice. There were multiple towels and face cloths; but no bar soap, boxed tissues, nor, strangely, any hot water in the bathroom sink.
If I were in the area, I would not want to stay anywhere else; and I'd welcome the opportunity to return with my Wife and enjoy the hospitality of The Clifton Cottage again!

A Night at Beinglas Farm,"I spent a rainy night at the Beinglas Farm while hiking the West Highland Way. Beinglas Farm is conveniently located right on the West Highland Way and offers a variety of accomodations: B&B Rooms, Bunkhouses, Chalets, and Campgrounds. I stayed in a roomy B&B room which was quite spacious and had three single beds in the room. After hiking in the rain all day (with intermittent rain through the night) having the extra space in the room was very handy for drying clothes and gear.

The farm has an onsite restaurant and bar, camp store, and laundry facilities. Unfortunately, because of the rainy conditions, all of the farm's facilities under a roof were overcrowded and congested.

I had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant./bar which has a rustic Pub style. Because of the crowding, seating was at a premium with diners waiting to pounce on any chairs vacated and left available. Dinner felt rushed and the meal unremarkable. Breakfast, served buffet style but with only a mini-buffet was only so-so and had only a few options. There was no fruit or yogurt offered and only bread toast was available with no rolls or croissants.

A 10 Pound key deposit is required which I felt was out of line.

Conflicting and erroneous information was offered by various members of the Beinglas Farm staff, notably from the Reception Staff (which was also the Bar staff) and the camp store clerks. An important message about the next day's hiking about bridge washouts, was never delivered to either of us.",September 2019,Beinglas Farm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635936-d3810339-Reviews-Beinglas_Farm-Inverarnan_Loch_Lomond_and_The_Trossachs_National_Park_Scotland.html,"Inverarnan, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
A Trip to the Top of Conic Hill,"Last year, while hiking the West Highland Way, we took a trip to the top of Conic Hill. Besides the fact that it was right on the West Highland Way, our trip to the top - in favorable weather - was quite pleasant. We had an excellent view out over the Loch and the surrounding areas and thoroughly enjoyed the view. Right near the top, there were several of the shaggy Shetland cattle grazing right among the curious hikers and family groups.
Conic Hill was qute popular and even rather crowded near the top and particularly on the trail down. I noted several instances of ill-managed children and even had a slight accident caused by a child darting in front of me.

A Hike Along Loch Lomond,"The West Highland Way travels along the shore of Loch Lomond for at least one full day of hiking. From what we saw, the Loch was very beautiful and pleasant. However, since most of our day's hike was in a torrential rain downpour, we did not see too much of the Loch and missed much of its charm.

Rowardennan Hotel Restaurant,"We had dinner and breakfast at the Rowardennan Hotel Restaurant. It was convenient for us since we were staying there and there wasn't much other choice for eating nearby on foot.
Reservations were required for dinner - even for hotel quests - whether dining inside or outside. The outside dining was limited to uncovered picnic tables.
For dinner I chosed the Pork Belly which I thought wasn't very good, probably the worst Pork Belly that I had ever experienced. I did enjoy the potatoes with my meal. My Hiking Partner ordered the Hamburger dinner which he did not enjoy nor finish. Perhaps our menu choices were just ill-advised butit was surprising that both of our dinner choices should both be unsatisfactory.
Breakfast was presented buffet style, as usual. However, the arrangement of the serving trays and food items was haphazard and insufficient. Even at the start of the breakfast meal, many items were not available or ready yet. Eggs were being produced one-by-one to be put in the warmers.

The Rowardennan Hotel,"While hiking the West Highland Way, the Rowardennan Hotel was exactly perfect for my needs since it was located right on the West Highland Way - and it was seven miles in either direction for alternative lodgings.

The room was standard except that it was very dim and poorly lit. Even with the bathroom door open and the bathroom light on, I could barely read. The room had standard amenities but it did have a coffee kettle and fixings including decaf coffee.

The bathroom had a tub & shower combination with a point of use water heater. It did not have bar soap, tissues, wash clothes, or a toilet paper holder - all of which I consider essentials of a hospitable hotel.

Service at the reception desk was very good and hospitable and welcoming - not quite as good at the restaurant and bar. Reservations were required even if staying at the hotel. I had the pork belly which I thought substandard (though the potatoes were very good), my hiking partner had the hamburger which wasn't to his liking.

Not usually a Scotch drinker (my tastes usually prefer Bourbon) I was pleasantly surprised to see how well I enjoyed the very good taste of the Glengoyne Single Malt Whisky! I tasted the 12 year old Glengoyne, on the ""Glengoyne Tour""but in retrospect, I wish that I had taken the ""Wee Tasting Tour"" which also included a tasting of the 18 year-old Glengoyne Old Highland Single Malt Whisky.

The Premier Inn seemed rather mediocre, and it was inexpensive and convenient, but while it suited me and my needs just fine, it didn't have any ""pizzazz"".

Pompeii Archeological Park,"My first visit to Pompeii was more than fifty years ago, and I've been back a number of times in the intervening years; but it is still as fascinating, and as timeless and enchanting as on my first visit all those years ago! Pompeii - now called The Pompeii Archeological Park - seems to be a little more tourist friendly than it was in the '60's, but the timeless and unchanging display of interrupted ancient life is as captivating and fascinating as if it were a first visit.

Amalfi Drive,"A drive along the Amalfi Drive on the southwestern coast of the Neapolitan Riviera is a lifetime experience. It has been many years since our first excursion along this beautiful iconic drive, but it is still as beautiful, interesting, and entertaining as it was the first time all those years ago. Some things are timeless and never to be forgotten. If anything, it is a little more developed, and the road widened slightly, since our earlier trip, but none of the charm has been diminished.

Sunset Dinner at Zi'Ntonio Mare Restaurant in Sorrento,"One night during our stay in Sorrento we had a sunset dinner at Zi'Ntonio Mare Restaurant right on the waterfront. It was great. The restaurant is located on the beach, nestled adjacent to the marina and the various boats, private and commercial. We were seated on the outdoor terrace just above the water with good views both seaward and shore-ward. As the evening got later, and the stars and shore lights were turned on, it was quite beautiful. Our meal was extensive and delicious. Every course was s delicious as the previous one. It would have been hard to finish it all if it hadn't been so tasty. Service was relaxed and friendly - just right for the location and occasion!

The Grand Hotel Vesuvio - Sorrento,"The Grand Hotel Vesuvio - Sorrento, like most, or all, of the hotels in Sorrento is located well uphill from the shore, perched on the side of the cliff/mountain. It is a large hotel, with a huge lobby, restaurants, terraces, and three lifts. The distance from the shore is balanced by a shuttle bus running 14 times daily from the hotel to the town below.
We had room #394 which was reached via a complicated route around and about down a long wing. The room itself, had a nice large balcony out onto a terraced area between wings of the hotel. (See pictures for a view from the balcony.)
Room #394 was large with two twin beds pushed together in European fashion, with a white duvet and four pillows. There were two nightstands, each with wall-mounted spotlights over the night stands. Those lights and the overhead light were controlled with switches at the bedside.. The room also had a desk/vanity table and a straight chair, a luggage bench, a medium sized TV standing on the vanity counter, a large double wardrobe closet, a refrigerator and mini-bar, and a phone in the room. There were one, or two, spare electrical outlets for charging purposes. The balcony was reached through a pair of louvered French Doors.
The bathroom had a tub/shower combo with a half glass panel; a bidet. A total of six towels were provided along with bar soap (but no face cloths or boxed tissue). The shower head was only fair to poor on the first night; but was changed out and replaced by the staff without us having to complain.",September 2019,Grand Hotel Vesuvio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187782-d277289-Reviews-Grand_Hotel_Vesuvio-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Sorrento, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0
The Sassi of Matera,"Visiting The Sassi of Matera on our trip to Puglia last summer was an unforgettable and fascinating experience. We had no ""pre-conceptions"" of Matera and the Sassi and were previously unaware of it. Were we in for an eye and mind opener! The ancient cave dwellings, some still in use, more that were lived in until recent years, were mind boggling and such a treat and curiosity. This visit was clearly one of the highlights of our entire trip. I would like to go back again and spend more time immersing myself into the ancient, yet current culture that facilitated the use of the cave dwellings.

The Grotto di Castellana,"On our visit to Puglia last summer, while we were staying in Alberobello, we visited the Grotto di Castellana one afternoon. The grotto, whose tickets and timed reservations must be made in advance, was truly interesting and fascinating. The grotto, actually ""caverns"" are viewed during a guided tour and are much more extensive than I had imagined. The pathways are well paved and safety railings are present wherever needed, especially where the path might be slippery or slightly steep or where stairs are present. The grotto itself is a visual treat with the different rock formations and developments. However, I found that the lighting , although great for visual viewing, did not lend itself well to my basic subcompact camera, so most (but not all) of my memories are mental.

St Anthony of Padua Church,We ducked into St. Anthony of Padua Church when a sudden rain shower interrupted our visit to see the Trulli's in Alberobello. Dry and sheltered from the rain we were able to explore the small and simple church with its lovely arched altar apse.

The Trulli's of Alberobello,"We visited the Trulli's in Alberobello last September and this was a highlight of our entire trip to Puglia. These small white stone buildings with their domed stone roofs are a treasure to behold. We were truly impressed with how well these old buildings have held up and been maintained through the centuries. Clean and freshly whitewashed, they almost appear as if they had been recently constructed. Invited to visit inside, we were amazed at the details of the brickwork forming the arched separations between the small rooms and the interior design and structure of the domed roofs. The number of these Trullis - an entire village of them - was also surprising.

The Grand Hotel la Chiusa di Chietri in Alberobello,"We stayed at Grand Hotel La Chiusa di Chietri in Alberobello for a couple of night during our trip to Puglia last September. It was a very nice hotel, actually a ""spa and rersort center', very likely the best hotel in Alberobello (We understand that there is only one other.) but it isn't really ""in"" Alberobello because it was a fifteen minute drive out in the country outside of Alberobello to reach the hotel. There is nothing around the hotel except fields and farms. You would have to have your own private transportation or be on a group tour to stay at the La Chiusa di Chietri; there is no public transport anywhere about.

That said, it has lovely grounds and a variety of lodgings, rooms and cabins and condos (I think). Lovely landscaping with extensive trees and shrubberies. The exterior is non-descript and understated without even a name sign on the exterior of the building. The front door/entryway leads to a secondary lobby somewhat removed from the main lobby and desk. The main lobby is located close to the bar and restaurant.

Room #123 was on the ground floor and had a view into a narrow courtyard and a raised walkway with more rooms opposite (see photo). The room was down a hallway/wing off the secondary lobby.. The room had two twin beds pushed together European style) to make one large-sized bed with three pillows and a white duvet. The room was good size but appeared to be missing furniture as there was a large open blank space at one end of the bedroom. Was this supposed to have been a sitting area or space for a table and chairs?

The room did have night stands and wall sconces above them on either side of the bed, two wall sconces on the wall opposite the bed, (all with switches controlled at bedside.); a desk/counter top with a straight back desk chair; a small TV on the countertop, a mirror, one luggage carrier, and a wardrobe closet. There was a phone in the room and a small refrigerator under the vanity but no coffee urn or fixings. A small safe was in the wardrobe closet.
The bathroom had an attractive red granite sink and countertop and a tub/shower combination. But there was only a cloth fabric shower curtain and the shower head and spray pattern were only so-so fair. There was a small selection of basic toiletries, bar soap but no tissues; and a non-heated towel rack with 6 towels, but limited hooks and hanging space in the bathroom.

Only one keycard was issued per couple and it was required to keep the room electric on.

We had dinner in the hotel restaurant on our first night there and it was good. Breakfast buffets, however were only fair (at best). There was only a limited number of items and selections with a limited selection of pastry, rolls, fruit, and cheeses, and only orange or pineapple juice. There were mostly fried eggs and no omelettes (despite previous advice that omelettes were available). A request for a scrambled egg resulted in a chopped up fried egg.There was only limited bacon and no sausage or hash. On the morning's breakfast, the hotel ran out of croissants. Coffee was provided by only one coffee machine with no coffee service to the tables.",September 2019,Grand Hotel La Chiusa di Chietri,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580227-d572494-Reviews-Grand_Hotel_La_Chiusa_di_Chietri-Alberobello_Province_of_Bari_Puglia.html,"Alberobello, Italy",hotels,3.0,4.0
That's Amore Restaurant in Rome,"On our last night in Rome last summer, my Wife and I were very fortunate to have had dinner at That's Amore Restaurant on Via in Arcione in Rome.
Decorated in a modern format, there was much to see and encounter among the decorations and decor. However, the real star was the meal which was quite extensive and most delicious. It was great!

The Circus Maximus in Rome,"On our last stay in Rome, last summer, we were fortunate to have been staying in a hotel just one block from the northwest end of The Circus Maximus in Rome and were able to pass by the Circus Maximus frequently during our two stays there. The Circus Maximus is quite impressive, largely because of it's size and extent. Although now looking probably very different from how it appeared two thousand years ago, the sheer size of the Circus Maximus is staggering when one considers how and when it was built. A little imagination of how it must have seemed and appeared to an Ancient Roman develops an appreciation for this historic location that stays in one's mind.

The ruins and remains of the Roman Forum, adjacent and nearby, are much more extensive and ""renovated"" for public viewing.

My Wife and I were quite fortunate on our last trip to Rome last summer to have had our hotel lodgings within walking distance of the Colloseum. We were able to stroll over and gaze on the mighty, awe-inspiring structure without the inconveniences of traffic, parking, or limited viewing time from a moving vehicle (unable to stop and pause in the traffic). On foot we could take our time, gazing as long as we wanted, waiting as long as necessary for people to move out of the way for the ""perfect"" photo, etc.

The Roman Forum is quite extensive and stretches for many blocks.

Two Stays at the Kolbe Hotel in Rome,"We stayed at The Kolbe Hotel Rome twice last year - at the beginning and end of our trip to Puglia and the Neapolitan Riviera. We've been to Rome a number of times but cannot think of a better place to stay while in Rome.
The Kolbe Hotel has an excellent location: across the street from the back wall of the Roman Forum, about a block and a half from the Circus Maximus, convenient walking distance to the Palatine Hill, Coliseum, Arch of Constantine, Victor Emanuel Monument, and the Gates of the Roman Forum!
The front facade of the Kolbe Hotel Rome is unpreposing and located on the Via Di San Teodoro, itself a very unassuming side street. You'll have to look carefully to notice the hotel (see the pictures below).
There is a large lobby with plenty of seating for weary and/or social travellers and the Desk Clerk(s) were very helpful and friendly.
We had two very different rooms during our two stays at the Kolbe Hotel:
Room #211 was located towards the back of the hotel on floor 1-1/2(?). It was the only room located just off a gallery reached from an extra flight of stairs - almost like a private mini-penthouse. It was a nice room, good sized with asymetric walls. There were two twin beds (with 4 pillows and a white duvet) with night stands and lamps, a small desk & chair, wardrobe closet (with removable hangers), and only one luggage rack. An unusual feature was that the large TV was mounted on a pedestal stand and positioned at the foot of the bed (basically in the center of the room!). The bathroom was good-sized and roomy with a tub/shower combination and a bidet. The shower had a 1/2 glass partition and a decent shower head. The bathroom had an attractive dark red granite sink counter and floor. The sink had a single lever faucet handle. There was a heated towel rack with 4-6 towels; and a nice selection of toiletries; with bar soap, but no face cloths, and only plastic drinking cups.
The room had no complimentary bottles of water, nor a coffee urn or fixings. It did have a mini bar.
There was no overhead light but the lighting was controlled from bedside.
; and there were some spare electrical outlets.
Dinner at the Hotel Kolbe dining room was very good, but the breakfasts, served on the terrace were only fair to good.

Room #233 was altogether different: Located on the front wall of the Kolbe Hotel Rome it had a view from window facing the front of the hotel and across the street to the back side of the Roman Forum. Room #233 also had a sofa/loveseat (which might have been a pull-out sleeper sofa) that backed onto the head of the circular bed. All/both were located in the center of the room with the bed facing towards the windows. The high headboard of the bed served as a divider between the two parts of the room. There were two TV, one each serving the bed, the other facing the sofa.

This is a great place to stay and we'd be pleased to stay there again on our next trip to Rome.",September 2019,Kolbe Hotel Rome,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d208553-Reviews-Kolbe_Hotel_Rome-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.5
The Areopagus in Athens,"The Areopagus in Athens is a fascinating place. Located at the northern foot of the Acropolis it is readily visible from the main gates of the Acropolis. Also called Mars Hill, it is the ancient site for the people of Athens to congregate and for speakers and orators of the day to address the public. Most importantly to Christians of the present time, this is the location where St. Paul addressed the Greeks when he was preaching in Athens during the first century. As such, it is a very important part of our history and culture.
My Wife and I had seen The Areopagus from the Acropolis on several previous trips to Athens, but this trip was the first time that we actually walked over to, and climbed up to the top of, The Areopagus. It isn't that high up and the steps and stairs (an older, steeper stone set and a newer steel staircase with an easier gradient) aren't that long or steep. The stone steps are uneven and can be slippery in damp weather while the top of The Areopagus is rough and uneven and footing might be a bit dodgy in a large crowd of tourists. Although not as high as the Acropolis, there is a nice 360 degree view of the adjoining area and the nearby city.

A more desolate and barren spot would be hard to find anywhere in the world. Viewed from below on the flat land surrounding the mountain, one can - with difficulty - locate the ancient Monastery clinging to the steep side of the Mountain, blending in with the drab colored rock. A single resort is located on the lower slopes of the mountain. The resort and/or the Monastery are accessible via a cable car from the ground below the mountain. From the viewpoint, no foliage or greenery of any kind is visible anywhere on the drab tan slopes. The nearest greenery and foliage is located well below the base of the mountain.

The Church of The Nativity in Bethlehem,"The Church of The Nativity is located in Bethlehem and is unfortunately located behind the walls of the Palestine area. In my mind, The Church of the Nativity with it's below-ground grotto/cave marking the birthplace of the Infant Jesus Christ, is second only to the Church of The Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem as the most sacred spot of Christianity in the Holy Land.

This is definitely something everyone should try at least once in their life. We noticed that extra / more showers had been added just on the shore and that the locker and shower rooms above the lake had been expanded and updated since our previous trip 5-6 years ago.

Qaser Al-Yahud - Christ's Baptismal Site,"The site of Christ's baptism by St. John The Baptist on the River Jordan is very interesting and must be experienced on any trip to the Holy Land. At the site, both banks (on the Israeli side and on the opposite bank on the Jordanian side) facilities have been developed with steps leading down into the water. Both sides have shaded pavilions and the Israeli side has several small altars nearby. The Jordan River, however, is not how one might picture it: It is small, narrow (only about 15-20 feet wide), and very muddy with a strand of barbed wire running down the center to mark and guard the border. Other than at the built up and developed steps, both banks are very overgrown with weeds and shrubs.
Border guards sit at picnic tables on either side to guard the border between Jordan and Israel.
The site is located in the West Bank and has been a contested area for years.

Via Dolorosa - The Way of The Cross,"The Via Dolorosa - The Way of the Cross is a winding path through the ancient Old City of Jerusalem tracing the route that Our Lord carried His Cross on His way to be crucified on Calvary. This is a awe-inspiring and inspirational journey that any Pilgrim to the Holy Land must take. 2,000 years of development along the Via Dolorosa has camoflaged and, in some places, obliterated the original route. In fact, the final three of the fourteen Stations are now all located in one place: outside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (rather than in the original locations which are inside or underneath the Church itself). It is best to go in the very early morning, before the shops and stalls of the Old City fully come to life in order to experience the Via Dolorosa in its best light and with a minimum of current, modern distraction. Because of the cobblestone paving along the whole way, and the many sloping areas and steps in places, The Way of Th Cross is not very ADA compliant and wakers and/or wheelchairs will have difficulty managing its length.",July 2019,The Way of the Cross - Via Dolorosa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293983-d318931-Reviews-The_Way_of_the_Cross_Via_Dolorosa-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",attractions,5.0,4.5
Christ's Tomb,"Christ's Tomb is probably the most sacred and inspirational shrine in all of the world. Certainly it is the most important and holy place in Jerusalem. Even despite the sometimes very crowded conditions, Christ's Tomb cannot help but cause each Pilgrim to have an inspirational and reverential thoughts and frame of mind during a Pilgrimage visit. This is a must-see place; but let's face it, Christ's Tomb is the reason why you came to Jerusalem and the Holy Land in the first place. Do not forget to see the location of Christ's Crucifixion and the site and stone upon which His lifeless Body was laid after the Crucifixion.",July 2019,Christ's Tomb,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293983-d324448-Reviews-Christ_s_Tomb-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",attractions,5.0,4.5
The Mount of Olives,"The Mount of Olives, the sacred and historical hillside across the Kidron Valley from the east gate of old Jerusalem is filled with numerous significant locations important in the life of Jesus Christ. While parts of the Mount have been otherwise developped, many areas have been developed as Churches to celebrate important episodes in the Life of Jesus Christ such as the Basilica of the Agony (Church of All Nations) celebrating Christ's Agony in the Garden; The Domini Flugit where Jesus cried over the city of Jerusalem; The Church of The Pater Noster where Christ taught His disciples how to pray; and the Garden of Gethsemane next to the Basilica of the Agony where Jesus Christ spent his last night in prayer.
All of these locations are well worth a visit, and should be mandatory for any visit to the Holy Land, but are all closely located - all on the Mount of Olives!",July 2019,Monte das Oliveiras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293983-d318947-Reviews-Monte_das_Oliveiras-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",attractions,4.0,4.5
