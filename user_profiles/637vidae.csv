Top notch experience,"Top notch experience with a special thanks to our driver Shahid. He was so polite and explained the schedule tour for us properly and he gave amazing ideas for when we stopped to take photos for sunset. Highly recommend him as if we go next time we will definitely choose him.
The tour included buggy’s, camel ride, dune bashing followed by a bbq/dessert dinner, fire show, tannoura dance and belly dancing.",October 2020,"Red Sand Dunes Desert Safari, BBQ Dinner, Camel Ride, Sand Boarding In Dubai",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g295424-d13500354-Red_Sand_Dunes_Desert_Safari_BBQ_Dinner_Camel_Ride_Sand_Boarding_In_Dubai-Dubai_Em.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",activities,5.0,5.0
"Average hotel, woudnt return","the hotel itself and the rooms are nice, however we didn't get a balcony with our room which was a bit disappointing. the pool is filled with a lot of children if you're looking for a relaxing place i don't suggest this hotel its more family friendly with loud kids, the music wasn't loud at the pool area.. The restaurant options weren't great as both of them had nearly the same menu, the food presentation wasn't up to the standards, food was bland lacking flavor in everything we ordered except for the Tom Yum soup. we told the waitress we will be eating in a sharing style and they never got us plates so me and my husband has to eat from the dish in the middle of the table. Also when we finished our meals they wouldn't remove the empty dishes off our table which was super weird. Overall i wouldn't return again. The check in and check out process takes around 15-20 mins per person it was so long. i know this is new hotel and they have room for improvements. Also i couldn't sleep properly as in the hallway you can hear people chatting and laughing so it was disturbing.",August 2020,C Central Resort The Palm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d19175168-Reviews-C_Central_Resort_The_Palm-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,3.0,5.0
Such a lovely restaurant with delicious food and outstanding hospitality,"It was our time for me and my husband to dine at Ammos. Tony the manager was so kind, polite, friendly & helpful in assisting us with the food selection and drinks. Dubai needs more managers like him. He had an honest opinion and wasnt pushy at all. He also surprised us with a dessert for our anniversary dinner. I love Greek food and can easily suggest Ammos for people to try out as they wont regret it. Cant wait to return and try other food options :D",August 2020,AMMOS Greek Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d15199871-Reviews-AMMOS_Greek_Restaurant-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Authentic Mexican restaurant,"We had a wonderful experience at the restaurant, they had a mariachi band playing and singing a couple of times which gives you the authentic Mexican experience. They are very talented as well as the drummer who shook things up and pumped up the crowd. Food was tasty but overpriced in my opinion. We sat downstairs for dinner which was a calmer vibe but we moved upstairs around midnight and this is where the party started, they had salsa dancers and drummer entertaining the crowd.
Overall we had a lovely experience thanks to Fernando and Christian who were always attentive to us.
I absolutely loved that all the staff are Latin it really adds the authentic touch.",January 2020,Puerto 99,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d17377799-Reviews-Puerto_99-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Take me back to Greece,"First of all, the interiors made me feel so close to Greece, the food was delicious and the prices weren't that bad. Note that you can only sit there for 2 hours which isn't bad. The best part was mix of Arabic/Greek music they play and then they perform their traditional Sirtaki dance with plate smashing.

valet parking,"the employees at valet parking couldn't find my keys for 20 mins which worried me a lot & on top of that whenever i asked what happened to my keys & wheres my car they ignored me even when i raised my voice louder. U had to help them find my keys which i couldn't either but after sometime they found it and my valet ticket had a stamp in red clearly saying its paid, the man at the valet asked where is the 2nd ticket i said when i drove in i was given only 1 ticket and he kept arguing with me and i mentioned may times that it says i paid already anyway & asked to get my car. but they kept torturing me without giving my car back. it was the most stressful & upsetting experience i ever had in Dubai valets. its a shame i had to yell & get into tears thinking my car was given to someone else or keys were lost. eventually got my car back after all this trouble.",January 2017,"V Hotel Dubai, Curio Collection by Hilton",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d9762100-Reviews-V_Hotel_Dubai_Curio_Collection_by_Hilton-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,1.0,4.5
