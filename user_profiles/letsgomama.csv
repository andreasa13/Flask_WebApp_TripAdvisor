has not disappointed us yet!,"Every time we have been, I have been delighted with the perfect service, pleasant relaxing ambiance, and most of all the excellent food. There are always a ton of options that are gluten free that are not salad or grilled fish/chicken like most places. These gluten free meals are as delicious and creative as what gluten eaters can have! My husband loves their paella, so he gets it every time. I get something different every time because the food is so good and it is so rare I get so many good options!!! There are excellent appetizers as well. I just wish they would make their dessert menu more GF friendly. We get soooo tired of ice cream as the only options.",January 2020,Olive Lucy's Kitchen Table,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60906-d3929686-Reviews-Olive_Lucy_s_Kitchen_Table-Morristown_Morris_County_New_Jersey.html,"Morristown, New Jersey",restaurants,5.0,4.0
exceeded expectations,"This place was amazing! From the actual steles, statues and pillars (most of what you see on the Acropolis is actually replicated to protect the originals from further decay) displays on how they were made, what they meant, what they looked like originally (I never knew they were actually painted bright colors!) glass floors where you walk over actual ongoing excavations, and a phenomenal lego recreation with a humorous eplanatory table, we wished we had allowed more time to explore. We look forward to going back, and will spring for a tour next time going into deeper explanations. It was simply amazing to all of us- don't miss this. I resisted it, thinking we had seen everything at the acropolis itself. Don't make that mistake! It was incredible.",December 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
You have to do it. And you can. If you are brave. But it is so worth it!,"I am mobility impaired. I thought the Acropolis would be one of places that would be off limits to me. We were smart enough to book the Viator full day Athens private tour, and our wonderful driver knew exactly where to take me and who to talk to. (There is a discount for disabled people and their one companion.) He took me as close as possible to the chair lift that goes to the elevator. Without that you are looking at what would for me have been an impossible climb up hundreds of rough uneven stone flights of steps. The lift is a platform that slowly ascends up the long stairway. Those stairs are shallow and doable if you can walk at all. When you get to the top of that you then are taken into an industrial cage elevator that ascends the vertical cliff. This elevator is NOT for the faint of heart; in fact I was asked in broken English if I had any heart problems. I am severely claustrophobic but this elevator, being an open gauge cage, did not bother me at all. It takes you in your chair slowly up the face of that cliff and when you roll out, facing the magnificent parthenon, and slowly roll past the 7 maidens of the temple, you will find you cannot catch your breath because of the spectacular scale and beauty before you. Pictures fail, words fail, nothing can prepare you for the spirit and aura of this place. The views are incredible- all of Athens, Lycabettus hill, churches and mosques, the entire Agora, Mars Hill, the far mountains, even the coast on a clear day. It was difficult to navigate up at the top- much of the terrain is very rough even for my sturdy chair. Even where you can navigate the chair, prepare to have your kidneys rattled. But I am so so so grateful to the extremely helpful and encouraging staff, my family, and my knowledgable driver for making this possible for me. It more than exceeded anything I could have imagined.",December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Exceeded expectations,"This was a last minute booking and I was afraid the 3 pm time slot would shortchange us. It turned out to be perfect! We saw things we needed to see by daylight and then watched the sunset from the top of the spanish steps with St Peter’s in the background- it was amazing.
Our guide Nora was exceptional- knowledgeable, funny, interesting, personable and thoughtful. She took us places even my husband, a multiple visitor to Rome, had not seen and gave us tidbits and backgrounds even on the things he was familiar with.
Seeing Rome by Gil art was one of the best tours we have done. I am mobility impaired and was able to see everything I wanted to, and my family ( husband, adult son and daughter in law) saw more than they expected to or could have on foot.

MUST see Cant Miss for Duluth,"This is our favorite and standard visitor fare when people come to see us at our bakehouse in Wisconsin. We take a day to bring them to Duluth, to Canal Park, where we start with the LS Maritime Visitor Center. Excellent intro to learning about the lake and shipping industry, history of how Duluth beat out Superior for the harbor, fascinating story behind the Edmund Fitzgerald, even a fun replica of a ship's bridge. There are films depicting the formation of the Great lakes, and of ore boats being filled, emptied, and piloted. We always find it interesting and never get bored, oh- and it s FREE, they have clean bathrooms, a friendly gift shop, and you can watch the ships come in the harbor from inside on a cold day. If it is a nice day, we go outside, watch the bridge come up and wave to the crew on the incoming or outgoing ships.

"Historic. But go for dinner, not lunch.","So I have wanted to dine here for a long time based on reminiscences of family members from days gone by. My cousin brought me here for lunch on my birthday. I was a little disappointed. The building is fascinating, lots of great pictures from old days, historic pictures, tons of carved woodwork and ornate details. The service was prompt and professional, the food was ok, but the view I heard so much about was very underwhelming- basically a great view of the parking lot and another restaurant with a distant view of some lake. Much better views at the Boat Club a block down. Apparently, for dinner, there are white table cloths and a full menu including delectable steaks and so on. The lunch menu was more limited. My cousin had walleye he said was pretty good. I had the specialty burger on the plate (no bun) which brings me to my biggest disappointment- not a great place for lunch if you are gluten free. No GF bread option (Boat Club does.) and I couldn't have the fries or famous chips because they are not fried in a separate fryer, the soup and chili had flour in it, which left me with a choice of sautéed zucchini and squash. And my burger laying naked and shivering on the plate. Perhaps the dinner options of a steak or fish with a baked potato are better for we Celiacs but in terms of service and quality of the food we got, and the ambiance of the historic building I would go back and give the dinner menu a shot.",September 2019,PIckwick Restaurant & Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g43018-d409415-Reviews-PIckwick_Restaurant_Pub-Duluth_Minnesota.html,"Duluth, Minnesota",restaurants,4.0,4.0
stunning surprise,"We did not know about these murals before we arrived in Ashland. We saw one, and then decided to drive down main street to look at the quaint old buildings and happened to see a few more. Stunning! Stopped by the Ashland Historical Museum on main street to find out more, got a brochure and found 15 of the 18. Apparently, there is a guided trolley tour of them in the summer, and I think I will try that next year. I loved reading about the artists, the murals, and the fact that they are real people and places depicted in these murals. Some are tucked away, so the brochure was very helpful. The veteran one brought me to tears, the main street stores one was my favorite, I love the lighthouse keepers...goodness, they were ALL so good! Look for the German candy store painted like a gingerbread house evoking Hansel and Gretel!!! And do not miss the phenomenal mosaic mural on the wall of the food co-op- breathtaking! And even the garbage cans on main street have mosaics!

lovely respite in the day.,"This restaurant, formerly the Molly Cooper? recently opened in the downstairs of the Best Western Chequamegon Hotel. The hotel is worth seeing; though it was built in the 80's it was built to look like and capture the ambience of a grand old victorian hotel, with lots of old timey woodwork and antiques. The restaurant is bow shaped, looks out on the water, and has a cool, peaceful decor and ambience to it with soft music and lots of windows. The menu is small but well balanced, and interesting modern classics. I had the chicken with brie and prosciutto wrapped asparagus, my friend had the lemon garlic chicken wings appetizer for her main and took home enough for dinner, too. We splurged on the Swedish Cream award winning dessert and my goodness, they deserved that award! A generous portion of almondy thick cream- like a panda cotta almost, with a layer of lingonberry jam and topped with big fat blackberries and raspberries- it was the highlight of the day and worth the trip by itself. The service was a bit harried- only two girls working- but very friendly and we lacked for nothing. My only wish is that it was a leeeetle bit more Celiac friendly. The server seemed lost about gluten and had to ask about everything- but having said that, the kitchen clearly understood, made adaptations and I did not get glutened.",August 2019,Chequamegon Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g30341-d17640223-Reviews-Chequamegon_Grill-Ashland_Wisconsin.html,"Ashland, Wisconsin",restaurants,4.0,4.5
start here!,"We stopped in to see if they had a map of the murals, and spent an hour absolutely entranced. There are lovely antiques, fascinating historical displays and lots of wonderful miniature mock ups, as well as photos- my favorite was the display of then and now photos.

absolute must.,"we stopped here on the way by, and frankly we just wanted to use the bathrooms. We figured we have been to sooooooo many visitor centers and they are usually clean bathrooms and tons of brochures, maybe an anemic display or two. THIS. PLACE. ROCKS. Seriously, they should charge admission. Better than most museums I have been to. We spent hours, learned SO MUCH, watched a super cool film about shipwrecks of the great lakes, and could have stayed longer but had someplace we had to get to.

escaped with our lives.,"Cannot speak for the food as it turns out. Arrived on a Sunday afternoon, came in to be greeted diffidently by a young woman who seemed irritated by our very presence. There were four occupied tables and about 6 unoccupied VERY DIRTY un- bussed tables. Second young lady came up, asked how many, we told her three- she said ""well, its at least a 25-35 minute wait."" I looked around questioningly, she said ""there are a LOT of people waiting for these tables."" However, we saw no one waiting save two or three on the patio out front. We figured with the unwelcoming attitude, the filthy tables, and lack of apparent servers, they must be woefully and unexpectedly understaffed.

Wonderful surprise,"I am baffled by the terrible reviews. The restaurant was beautiful, cool clean tones, tastefully decorated, with absolutely stunning views of the lake. The service was friendly and impeccable. The menu for lunch was small and select, but varied. One of us had the crab cakes. She grew up in Maryland and pronounced them very, very good. One of us had the grilled chicken sandwich and normally she is a nibbler but she devoured the entire meal. I had the maple bacon burger, on a gluten free bun, and had a tomato bisque soup in place of the fries (the fries are NOT and cannot be gluten free.)Can I tell you that the soup was absolutely heaven on a spoon, and the burger was the best burger I have ever eaten. I called the server back twice to double check that it was in fact a gluten free bun as it was so soft and delicious. I cannot understand the negative reviews. I will give it another try but as far as I was concerned, we found a new go to place.",July 2019,Boat Club Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g43018-d12328849-Reviews-Boat_Club_Restaurant-Duluth_Minnesota.html,"Duluth, Minnesota",restaurants,5.0,3.5
iffy,"Ok, we went here last year and had a wonderful experience with great food and a nice chat with the owner. Wanted to get back this year and this time it was not so great. Sunday afternoon, we stopped by for lunch while out enjoying a drive. Only one other couple in the place. Greeter seemed nice but reserved- said hi and went back to her work, while we finally awkwardly chose a seat. The young lady doing the cooking seemed irritated we were interrupting her day. The advertised gluten free bun was ""no longer available"" and the cook then asked me if I wanted it on a regular bun instead. Um, CELIAC. I asked for gluten free bun because I CAN NOT HAVE WHEAT. Then the potato wedges looked battered. I asked, server said she would ask cook. Cook said no flour. So I ate three, when the server then came back and said the cook isn't ""FOR SURE"" they aren't battered, she had thrown the box they came in away! IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THESE THINGS. I cant just take a chance on it. I ate no more and lost confidence in the safety of the food. Too bad because the meat was cooked juicy and just right, and my partner loved his mama burger. I just felt like we wandered in rather unwelcome and got the babysitters trying to run things. Most disappointing. If you do not have food allergies, you will love this cute, clean, adorable place with cute menus and excellent burgers. I hear the chicken is very very good, too.

different and tasty,"We had heard a lot about this place, had seen its reviews on Tripadvisor, our guide mentioned it, and it came up in a recommended gluten free restaurants site. Perhaps it was overhyped, or perhaps I was fatigued from my journey but It wasn't what I expected at all.
First of all, it is very, very small and cramped. The tables were unclean because it was very busy. There were very very few gluten free options after all. I had a most delicious and unique omelet, with cauliflower and other vegetables and herbs in a wonderful sauce and I was not disappointed. Husband had the croque madame and loved the flavorful ham and gruyere cheese on a hearty slice of artisan bread. Not something you generally find anywhere else. But there were very few pastries or treats at all, and only one gluten free. I was told they usually had a rich chocolate brownie type cookie that was gluten free but was sold out. Came the next day to try it, and again, it was ""sold out."" Either it is THAT GOOD, or there isn't much demand for it so they don't make it or make enough, I don't know.
I might try this place again just because the food was so unique and tasty, but I won't count it on my gluten safe list. When a place lists itself as gluten free friendly, but don't even have a gluten free bread for their many sandwiches, or gluten free bakery items, it is disappointing. Perhaps in the summertime with the influx of visitors, they have more. I recommend you give it a try, though. Unless you are claustrophobic.",January 2017,Persephone Bakery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60491-d4453231-Reviews-Persephone_Bakery-Jackson_Jackson_Hole_Wyoming.html,"Jackson, Wyoming",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Best Chili, best experience!","We found this on Tripadvisor and decided to give it a try after a long day negotiating the hordes in DC Easter Weekend. What a treat! It is a small, relaxed kind of place, very warm and welcoming. Our server brought us drinks and two sampler trays of the chili and explained them. She complimented all of our choices, and she was right, they were all superb! Tater tot dish, chili burger, chicken alamo, and a corn bread chili dish were delectable, perfectly seasoned and hearty. Drinks kept coming, and we left full, satisfied, comforted, renewed, and only sorry there isn't one of these near us in New Jersey!

"clean, reasonable, convenient","We have stayed at this hotel before with family members. It is an exceptionally well maintained, clean, nicely appointed hotel very convenient to the city but with great rates and free parking. My only concern this trip was that the staff seemed cold and preoccupied, and did not greet us when we came in or out, appeared to be almost surly when interrupted. Others in the elevator commented on this as well, so it reassured me that it was not just me. This was not the case the last time we stayed so perhaps it was an aberration. I hope so. It is called the hospitality industry for a reason- people want to feel welcomed and trusting. There are restaurants within easy distance of this hotel, and it feels like a clean safe area, and only took us 15 or 20 minutes to zip into DC. Be aware that they, like most hotels in the DC area, have king beds or double beds- finding two queens in the DC area is very hard to do. This hotel has only an outdoor pool, but since we no longer have young kids, that is no big deal to us. The food service is good- waffles, the usual omelets or scrambled eggs and sausage, even gluten free cheerios for we Celiacs. Great coffee, and cookies and fruit round the clock.

it adds up.,"A friend suggested this cafe because I am Celiac, and they offer gluten free options-a relative rarity in New Jersey. I live in Summit, but have never tried this little cafe across from the theater on Springfield Ave. I looked up the menu and was impressed.
This is not a sit down and be served cafe. You line up, order soup, salad and or sandwiches, and wait til they call your name-sort of Panera lite.
It is small, clean, modernly spare decor, the staff was friendly.
My first disappointment was that there were 4 soups and the only GF offering was cream of mushroom. Blech. Mushrooms are a distinctive flavor. You like it or hate it. Im in the latter camp.
The sandwiches look good and they offer Udi's GF bread as an option.
The custom salads are superb. You take a menu and circle your choices of greens, veggies and add ons and dressing. They make it, and call your number.
But first, you pay...and i mean PAY. The custom salad base price is 7.95. With that you choose one of four greens, and three veggie choices. And a dressing. Good variety, fresh quality. But each additional veggie is a dollar, and then there are add ons, ranging from 2-4 dollars each-bacon, chicken, boiled egg, cheese, avocado, etc. Before you know it, your yummy custom salad is twice that. I had a kale salad with onion, bacon, and avocado, cucumber and beets. It still seemed mostly kale- and cost me 15 dollars.
I can see how it could easily have added up to twice that if I put on it what I would at a help yourself salad bar.
My other beef is that when you pay, they turn the screen around and ask you to enter a tip. Your choices are no tip, 15, 18 or 20 percent. It made me feel backed into a corner. Why should I tip for no service? You get your own soup, your own drink, and you come up to the counter and pick up your own food. But if I put no tip, I seem a cheapskate. And I have no way of knowing if I would get ""punished"" for that.
I may give this place another try- on a day with a GF soup I like and try the sandwich. Will probably avoid the fresh and tasty but overpriced custom salad because it is too easy to circle the add ons. It is tasty and clean, but a little tinny in the noise department, and the bill will be much higher than you expected. Adjust for that and you will like it just fine.",January 2016,Batavia Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46855-d5563019-Reviews-Batavia_Cafe-Summit_New_Jersey.html,"Summit, New Jersey",restaurants,3.0,4.0
one of a kind service from a chain...,"I love this chain. Like any chain, some are excellent, some are, shall we say, complacent. This one definitely cares.
I have two allergies that make chinese food dangerous- celiac disease (gluten-wheat, rye and barley) and shellfish. For the most part, I avoid asian cuisine because they use fish or oyster sauce, soy sauce, and it just turns out to be a problem. Not so here!
The chain has a special menu tailored for allergies. I only have a few options but all are excellent.
The service at this particular establishment was superb-I felt heard, cared for, safe, and catered to. It was clean, pervasively friendly without being intrusive, and if I lived anywhere near here I would be such a regular they would know my name.

not gonna make it...,"With a prime location right next door to the MAYO and some interesting fare, a quirky decor, and having started out well, I was hopeful. Subsequent trips back have left me unhappy in more ways than one.
For starters, we had reservations made months in advance for a 5:45 seating. When they started to seat us in THE most undesirable table in the entire restaurant, a table smack in the middle of high traffic, in the line of gale force winds each time the door opens, we asked if we could have the booth sitting empty instead. I am disabled and have trouble maintaining my balance on the ridiculously uncomfortable tiny round bistro seats. We were told no. I asked if it had been specifically reserved and was told no, but that it was a ""timing issue."" We explained the problem, and they politely but steadfastly refused to accommodate us. 15 minutes later another group of four came in and were given the booth. I was miserable the entire meal. Had to wear my coat as cold causes my body to seize up. Had to have help maintaining my seat. Just awful and no one could give me a reasonable explanation as to why we could not be moved to another table.
Secondly, I have doubts about their understanding of gluten free. The server is happy to go ask, but three times she went to ask and never came back with the answer. I questioned two things- how could a polenta made with pumpkin ALE and a pudding made with STOUT be gluten free? No one ever could tell me, so I was afraid to eat it.
Which brings me to another issue- I love the movement toward smaller, specialized seasonal menus locally sourced. But this is the SAME EXACT TINY MENU we have had since we came in August, October, and December. I have now had all three things I care to try. And there are only the same three desserts, only one of which is truly gluten free.
I also need to give some feedback about the drinks-they sound wonderful! They sound AMAZING! and they taste...well...kinda gross. I tried the cucumber mint and the pomegranate lemonade and the apple fizz. Husband had the spiced harvest tea. All of them are TOOOOO SWEEET and the taste is lost in the heavy hand of cinnamon or mint and simple syrup. Tone that back and bring out some of the natural flavors.
The duck was good, the hanger steak good but nothing special, the braised lamb was excellent, the hamburger was tasty and the fries are good, daughter said the pork chop was the best she had ever had. There is...or was...potential, but they need to tune it up a bit.
Im not sure I have it in me to try again- it was chaotic, and I was left so cold by the absolute refusal to accommodate my needs-with so many many excellent choices within walking distance (and parking is a real issue for this restaurant as well) I think I will expand my horizons for before or after shows.",December 2015,South+Pine American Eatery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60906-d8336430-Reviews-South_Pine_American_Eatery-Morristown_Morris_County_New_Jersey.html,"Morristown, New Jersey",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"perfect location, great food.","We decided to give this new place a try mainly because of the location, smack next door to the Mayo Performing Arts in Morristown. The reviews commended the food, so we thought it was worth a try. It was.
The atmosphere is interesting quirky, shabby chic and eclectic, with painted doors and old windows hung on the wall, copper cookware as art and yet beaded glass chandeliers. I loved it! The waitstaff are friendly and easy to spot with their matching black tee shirts, and at least ours, Alex, was VERY knowledgable about the menu and clearly up to speed on the Gluten factor, something important to me with Celiac. While it did appear at times that the staff were running in circles or things were a little chaotic, the reality was our service was friendly, attentive without being intrusive, timely, and efficient.
The food was excellent. I like the smaller menu. One feels the food is fresh and done right rather than yanked from the freezer and quickly done up. The food is interesting and a little different without being weird and too artsy. I had the Black Garlic Caesar salad, with perfect kale, shaved parmesan, chick peas, and a tangy garlic dressing. Simple, but delectable. Daughter had the Apple salad, which she said was excellent, with the sweetness of the fruits contrasting nicely with the tartness of the dressing. She ate every bite. We shared the signature burger, without the bun. I asked for the egg to be cooked hard, as I dislike gooey yolk. I know Chef's hate that, but it was my preference and it came out with the white cooked crisp and the yolk still uncooked. Not soft, I mean, totally wet. Alex apologized and offered to take it back but I preferred to remove the egg and eat the cheeseburger. It was otherwise cooked perfectly and very tasty.
Husband wanted the duck, but Alex explained that it was already sold out (at 5:45 on a Saturday night-Im guessing for whatever reason they just didnt have any that day, which happens. We will try back.) so he went with the Chatham Cod, which came in a chowder sauce with a nice chorizo crisp sprinkled on it. He said it was excellent and filling.
We finished up with the Chocolate Stout pudding with pretzel topping for husband, which came in a generous bowl, and which he cleaned up and almost licked the bowl, and the Pumpkin Panna Cotta, without the graham cracker streusel for we ladies. It was served in a mason jar, rich with pumpkin pie flavor and with a heartier texture than typical panna cotta. I loved it.
The only iffiness of the night was with the drinks- while I enjoyed very much the cucumber mint cooler, a refreshing maceration of cucumber with mint in club soda, my table mates did not care for it at all. Their Autumn spice ice tea (think constant comment meets chai) and Pomegranate lemonade were both excruciatingly sweet. The tea was consumed by both but the Pomegranate lemonade was all sweet and no flavor-maybe a bad batch? They left it, and after I tasted it, I didnt blame them.
We left feeling delighted with the restaurant on whole, and looking forward to coming back for the Hanger steak, the missing duck, and the lamb shank. I hope the menu changes seasonally, because it is very small, but I must say it is done right and I hope South&Pine make it in the cutthroat Morristown scene-not just because of their perfect location for the show, but because chef Leia Gaccione has something special and remarkable to offer.",October 2015,South+Pine American Eatery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60906-d8336430-Reviews-South_Pine_American_Eatery-Morristown_Morris_County_New_Jersey.html,"Morristown, New Jersey",restaurants,4.0,4.0
like dining at a friend's house,"Our extended family has been vacationing or living at Lake Nebagamon since 1930, so we have seen a lot of restaurants in the area come and go. We just bought a house in Lake Nebagamon, and made three trips in as many months in the process. Each trip included one or two visits to Twin Gables.
It is small, the front is a restaurant room and the back is a bar. The menu is substantial, and enhanced by specials written on the chalkboard wall. But when you walk in, you walk into a warm, friendly, welcoming place run by the ever present and smiley Sherry, and as she is hugging and greeting regulars and locals by name, one thinks of ""Cheers, where everybody knows your name, and you are really glad you came.""
They are known for their fish frys (whitefish on Friday, Walleye on Saturday, broiled or fried) their ""Broached"" chicken in its crispy batter, and the fall off the bone ribs in tangy sauce. And their pies-oh, dear Lord, their PIES! The strawberry Rhubarb was perfection in a flaky crust. There is a selection of fruit pies and a cheesecake or two, maybe a chocolate silk...if you have room. If not, trust me, ask for it to go and take it home.
The service is excellent, the salad bar fresh and varied, and watching Sherry run around making it all look easy puts a smile on your face and a hug in your heart.
This place has been around a long time, and i hope it is around forever somehow. You can't go wrong, unless you come in expecting New York Dining or have a bad attitude. This is down home cooking in a down home atmosphere and it just doesn't get any better than that.",October 2015,Twin Gables Cafe & Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g59739-d4919560-Reviews-Twin_Gables_Cafe_Lounge-Brule_Wisconsin.html,"Brule, Wisconsin",restaurants,4.0,4.5
clean and helpful,"I love Culvers. And not just for their flavor of the day ice cream. While the ice cream (custard style) is the ultimate in creamy and flavorful without being cloyingly sweet, and with the infinite variety of flavors, styles and add ons, they also have a solid menu that grinds all other ""fast food"" into the dirt. There is a reason that across the street, the golden arches employees were bored while the lot here was full and the drive through here was four cars deep.
From a perfect burger with a warm, soft, gluten free bun, to the pot roast sandwich, they offer things you can't get other places. The usual suspects of burgers, chicken fingers, etc are surprisingly fresh tasting, and the fries are hot and crispy every time. EVERY. TIME.
But what really sets it apart for me is the fresh faced friendly helpful go out of their way to make it a good experience staff. No waiting at the counter with a dozen other milling people-they deliver it to your table, hot and ready. They take your order cheerfully and patiently, bring it while it is hot, and ask what else they can do for you.
This is a well run chain, and Superior has an especially well managed restaurant with a well trained staff who keeps the place clean as a whistle and filled with happy faces.
And they offer free wifi-and that, my friend, is like the cherry on the top of a perfect Sundae-which they also have in spades.",October 2015,Culver's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60320-d409545-Reviews-Culver_s-Superior_Wisconsin.html,"Superior, Wisconsin",restaurants,4.0,4.0
a favorite that gets better and better,"For many many decades, our extended family has been stopping at Tobies as the ""halfway point"" between the Twin Cities and the North Woods where we own cabins. It used to be a pull off of the highway into the lot, for the bakery and a few tables for soup and sandwiches, and now it is a big bakery, restaurant, and more at the interchange. But it still makes the BEST pecan rolls and Limpa bread you can get anywhere. In recent years, they have added more foods, gifts, treats, and souvenirs, but the best thing they have added is the selection of gluten free items for the Celiacs among us who watched enviously as the others devoured cinnamon rolls and pies and smacked their lips. On a recent trip, the Gluten free offerings included cinnamon rolls, pies, flaky biscuits, lemon bars, carrot cake and coffee cake. We stocked up as usual with bread, limpa, carmel pecan rolls, cinnamon buns, pies and so on for the week, and stoked up with coffee and jams, and as we left, as we have every trip, we blessed the friendly servers and the excellent baked goods, which despite the growth and touristy feel, have maintained their quality no matter what.",October 2015,Tobies Restaurant and Bakery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g43164-d508358-Reviews-Tobies_Restaurant_and_Bakery-Hinckley_Minnesota.html,"Hinckley, Minnesota",restaurants,5.0,3.5
clean and quiet.,"I stay at Hampton Inns because they are consistent-great beds, good food, clean, and friendly. We chose this one because we wanted to be out of the city toward the North where we were headed.
The staff were friendly and professional, the room was clean and exceptionally quiet. I was surprised that the bathroom door knob was hanging loose-Hamptons are usually on the ball with this kind of thing, and as with most of the older Hamptons there are a lack of grab bars for safety in the bathroom. I wish wish wish hotels would protect themselves from liability and guests from injury stepping into and out of the shower/tubs where the floors are frequently wet and often at a different level by simply putting a grab bar on the wall next to it for grabbing as one enters or exits the shower.
This Hampton was otherwise in great condition, with a quiet and efficient cooling system, solidly built and quiet, clean as a whistle, and helpful-one of the staff brought me water when she overheard me tell my husband I was terribly thirsty when we arrived, and another cleaning the breakfast area saw me having difficulty and jumped to help me manage my coffee and plate.
We will definitely make this our regular stopping point when we fly into MSP and drive up to our vacation house in the Northlands.",October 2015,Hampton Inn & Suites Lino Lakes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g43259-d674762-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Lino_Lakes-Lino_Lakes_Minnesota.html,"Lino Lakes, Minnesota",hotels,4.0,4.5
Never fails to impress me.,"There is a reason why it is hard to get in to this restaurant. Make your reservations in advance. This visit, we decided to give lunch a try, since booking a month in advance still had no dinner time options that worked for us.
I find it perplexing and amusing to read reviews from people saying it was ""gloomy"" and overpriced. Clearly people from sunny, cheap regions who are accustomed to plain hearty tasteless fare.
We have eaten here many times, and have eaten at almost all of the Epcot restaurants over the years. Most are very good to very okay. This is superlative.
I love the atmosphere-far from gloomy, I find it cozy, cool and quiet. The service is some of Disney's finest, and that is saying something since most of the retail world could learn from Disney's service training.
I always mention in my reservation that I have Celiac (gluten allergy) and they always have fresh, hot, delicious GF rolls for me, and are very knowledgable about what is safe for me to eat. I have never gotten ""glutened"" by accident there.
From the OUTSTANDING Poutine-homecut fries slathered with a garlicky red wine reduction and topped with fresh cheese curds and truffle salt- (I could eat this every day and never ever tire of it.) to the fresh crisp and tangy salads, to the absolute perfection of the steaks, and finishing with our favorite Maple Creme Brûlée, we are always stuffed, satisfied, and eager to come back. Husband really likes the beer cheese soup, and the maple glazed salmon, as well. The wines are very good and pair nicely.
I rarely bother to review someplace every time I go, but I am always so pleased with this choice, I felt I needed to let people know-it is still excellent, it is worth every penny, and I look forward to it all year.",April 2015,Le Cellier Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34515-d492929-Reviews-Le_Cellier_Steakhouse-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Nice venture into exotic dishes,"I loved the spices used in the Moroccan lamb sausage, the rack of lamb was done perfectly and very tasty, and husband thoroughly enjoyed the trio of Baklava for dessert. Service was friendly and professional, we sat on the covered patio with marginal views of the Illuminations fireworks show- it is billed as a good viewing spot, but the reality is that the show takes place in the lagoon on the other side of the center island, so the view is obstructed somewhat. Still, we could see it, we were out of the rain, and it was a pleasant and tasty meal at a good price for what we got. My only real disappointment is how few gluten free options there are for we Celiacs. Kudos, however, to the well trained knowledgable wait staff-they knew what was safe to eat and what was not.

Couldn't be better!,"This Spanish influence restaurant in the heart of the old town, right off the pedestrian walk, was the whole package for lunch. We sat in a bright atrium area, had a funny, interesting server (David the fisherman) and I had many gluten free choices to select from. We shared the 1905 salad, I had the Palomilla steak, which was delicious, husband had a combo of Mixto Cuban sandwich, black bean soup, and an empanada, and pronounced it all ""excellent.""

Why is this place not packed???,"I generally do not put hotel restaurants high on my list. My experience has been that they tend to be very over-priced, with not a lot of concern for the quality that guarantees repeat business. Based on trip advisor reviews, we decided to give Blue Morel a chance for something new.
I was dismayed when we were seated, because there were only three tables taken. That remained the case for the evening. I wondered uneasily if there was a reason for it-do people know something I don't know?
Then we had the most wonderful evening! Two particular superlatives I must give high credit for. This is THE ONLY restaurant in this entire region I have been to where they brought me gluten free bread, without my even requesting it. The mid atlantic is woefully behind in meeting the needs of those of us with Celiac. I let the waiter know when I asked about my choices, and the next thing I knew, to my delighted surprise, they came with warm GF rolls. Wow!!!! The waiter was very knowledgeable about what I could eat and I felt very safe.
The second is that according to dear husband, they have absolutely the BEST wine by the glass menu he has ever seen.
We were there on a sunday evening. The sunday menu is Prix Fixe-select an appetizer, entree, and dessert from the varied and ample choices, with a handful of extra choices for an up charge.
I was impressed by the creative but not weird offerings. I had the apple compote squash soup and it was very good. Husband found the duck confit odd- a patty on greens-but tasty. His sea Bass was PERFECT, and my rib eye steak was better and cooked more perfectly than any I have had at any steakhouse in this area. I was stunned into delicious silence. Everything we had, down to the chocolate brioche husband devoured to the three scoops of sorbet (coconut, cranberry, and blood orange) was prepared perfectly, served beautifully, and scrumptious.
The service was warm and professional, present without hovering. The ambience was subtle and peaceful, and I loved being able to converse without competing with loud music, and chattering crowds.
I have no idea why this place was not crowded with regular customers. Either it was the sunday afternoon, or word needs to get out. Why would anyone want to deal with Morristown's parking issues, jostle the crowds, and shout over meals to be heard, when there was a top New York City quality food and service with easy parking and lovely surroundings just a little down the road?

Still loving it!,"This restaurant, housed since the mid 1970's in a 125 year old former cable car and powerhouse building in gentrifying downtown Denver is a family favorite since 1979. It is so much fun to take our adult children and their wives there and regale them with tales of our past-""right there, in the Cable car tables, I told your dad I was expecting you!!!""
In all that time, it has only gotten better and better. The food is solid American style Italian, trustworthy pasta, chicken Parm, salads, etc. It is the ONLY place I have ever found that serves their delicious Mizithra cheese and browned butter sauce. It comes with a decent salad and is followed up with Pistachio or other ice cream. They have fun drinks that come in keepsake glasses (of which we now have a full set, lol.) All around are antiques, tiffany glass, old repurposed stained glass windows, and nostalgic prints. There is some kind of magic in the air there, that makes the food taste better, the heart sing, and laughter flow! It has recently been remodeled, but retains its unique and cozy decor and ambience.

Not what I hoped for,"I need to start by saying that I found management to be exceptionally friendly, available, and helpful. I will also say that the condo was very clean. The location is good-the shuttle bus is nearby and will take you to Winter Park ski resort, or the nearby grocery store. There was a wonderful view of the mountains out the sliding glass door (which opened onto an unusable deck due to heavy snow.) The heat is a gas fireplace-lovely and more than sufficient. The seating area is small for a group of more than 5.
Now, here is what you need to know: This is a condo that is meant more for a group of college students (of which there were many, partying loudly in the hot tub underneath us! We found ourselves singing along to the drunken songs sung so loudly we could hear every word.) You must not mind a loud train going by every so many hours. You must not mind the neighbors clomping loudly up and down the stairs in board boots early in the morning, shouting gleefully in their excitement to hit the slopes. You must be able and willing to climb a steep flight of stairs to get to the condo, and to go upstairs to the loft bedroom area. If that is all okay with you, you wont mind the rest.
First of all, the design is different than any interval resort condos we have stayed in-there was no master bathroom, the bedrooms were tiny, and there was no in room jetted tub. There were no extra blankets and the ones there were not enough and skimpy. The select comfort bed did not work. The shower bar in the tub, a curved deal meant to expand the space in the shower and keep the curtain from wrapping around you, was installed BACKWARDS. Really???? The door to the main bathroom did not latch, so if someone opened the front door, the draft swung the bathroom door open for all to appreciate. Same with the bedroom door. Little annoying things, like the picture in the master bedroom is hung upside down. The kitchen chairs sag in the middle, making the bar press into your thighs. The internet is for the entire condo so at high use times, it was unbearably slow, or would not work (evening.) The first few days we were there, the hot tub was broken-a real problem when you return from a day skiing in a polar vortex, and crave the hot water to soothe your muscles and warm your bones. While I like the use of code entries, they do have to work-and these do not work well. Also, although this would apply anywhere, dont leave anything in the pool area and expect it to be there when you get back. Someone stole my son's bathing suit hanging on a hook next to the hot tub.
So it comes down to what is important to you-if you want clean, affordable, friendly, and adequate place to crash and sleep, fix a simple meal, and close to the slopes-its fine. If you were looking for any degree of luxury, or more than basic comfort, keep looking. This was our second time here-that says something. But this time, I was not able to ski, and found that it was NOT a good place if you have to hang out there all the time. I like my creature comforts-and for me, that means a master suite with a deep tub and a private bathroom, and a door that shuts tight. And this place has a foul odor which no one can identify. Perhaps a sewage leak from the past, or maybe kimchi cooking in another condo, not sure. But it was rank and that was disconcerting.
Twin Rivers has the potential to be a little better than it is with some attention to maintenance details, but the potential is fairly limited by its design. Could be improved though.",January 2014,Twin Rivers Condominium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33431-d317158-Reviews-Twin_Rivers_Condominium-Fraser_Grand_County_Colorado.html,"Fraser, Colorado",hotels,3.0,3.5
sweet little place,"We arrived in Frenchtown later than expected and needed a place for a quick bite of dinner on a friday night. We were directed to this cafe, which is nowhere near the town. It is a cute, friendly cafe and ice cream store. It was nearly empty when we arrived, but we were greeted in a friendly manner. Cute signs on the walls, clean and pleasant atmosphere. Menu is surprisingly varied, but fair warning to Celiacs-like many places, they do not really get the gluten free thing. I explained, and the waitress helpfully made a suggestion to help me order a meal without gluten, which was not easy, but then brought me my plate with a load of battered french fries! They were unable to find out if the batter had gluten, as they were frozen in a plain bag, and did not offer me any substitute. I did not dare to eat them as they were undoubtedly flour battered. They were getting ready to close, and cleaned right around us, and counted the register, but we did not feel pushed out at all.

what fun!,"We had a hard time finding this place but once we did, parked, and hiked the short walk to the hidden rock field (dirt path about a quarter of a mile from the parking.) We had brought a bag with some pvc pipe, small hammers, and a few pieces of pipe in varying thicknesses. The four kids immediately began clamboring over the field of rocks, tapping them with the implements to find the ones which sounded metallic and ""rang"" in different tones. It was a weekday, and we were almost the only ones there. My kids had such a great time inventing songs together. They were mesmerized by them! I sat on a large rock near the trail and watched them.

The ambience is lovely, whether you are on the windowed veranda seating, or in the upper dining room. I have not eaten in the bar area-it is always crowded and a bit noisy-but the other rooms are perfect for conversation and fine dining.
The staff are quite friendly and professional. You generally have two servers tag teaming, and they are very well informed on the food.
The food is always without exception excellent, often unique, and always fresh. They utilize local food sources, and create some delightfully different recipes. The menu changes frequently, so we never get tired of going back. The desserts are also special and wonderful, and also change with the seasons, so save room for them-well worth it!

Its no Roots Morristown...,"We frequently have dined at the Roots in Morristown, with friends who live nearby. We love it so much, we have gone there numerous times for special occasions on our own. Because we live in Summit, it seemed like a good idea to go there, assuming it would be of the same caliber.
What a disappointment, and one I cannot understand. It is crowded, oddly laid out, and though the food was disappointing, the worst experience all three times we tried again was the cold, disinterested, rude and snarky staff, from the so called greeters at the door who do not greet, to the waiters and water pourers. We are friendly, easy going people, and we expected the same level of professional, warm, top notch service we receive at Roots Morristown.
The food is also not up to snuff. Same menu, but the steaks were not cooked to our specification, the creamed spinach was cool, the popovers were gummy, and the potatoes lyonnaise were greasy. What the heck? Three times we tried again, and all three times we waited longer than 20 minutes despite a reservation, no sommelier, food plunked down without anyone checking back to see how things were. The last time, we were seated by the bar despite having requested a quiet back room table, with standing patrons poking their butts into our space while they waited for tables.

lovely respite,"We chose the Widow McCrea House for a quick getaway for our 36th wedding anniversary. Originally looking for just one night, chatting with innkeeper Lynn on the phone encouraged me to push hubby for two nights, at a discount. She also suggested we consider upgrading from Privacy suite to Cottage, and while we enjoyed the privacy suite, next time we will pony up for the cottage-it is larger, has sitting area, and its own little courtyard.
The Privacy suite had its own entrance in a small courtyard with a fountain. The decor is delightful, victorian antiques and yet with a fully modern and well appointed bathroom with a deep corner two person jacuzzi tub, and a corner shower with coved glass doors. Sweet touches like varying cat pictures, carved birds in the bathroom, and whimsical sculptures complete it.
The room is not overly large, it has a drop leaf table for breakfast, and a hard wooden rocking chair that is quite low to the ground. I would love for there to have been comfy chairs to sit in for chatting. It was private, but it is an old house. The people upstairs walking around, and the noises from the office behind us were easily heard, though not particularly bothersome. At 11, the Jacuzzis and fountain are turned off for quiet sake.
The inn is located close to Frenchtown village, which does roll up its sidewalks at 9. Nice town to poke through the shops, then go for a nice walk along the river on the canal path. Plenty of excellent food to be had here and nearby.
Burt prepares a delectable breakfast each morning and if you have the suite or cottage, it is delivered in a basket to your door-muffins still warm, crepes, french toast, quiche or other gourmet fare along with fresh fruit, orange juice, and coffee upon request. Fantastic!

Could not have been more perfect!,"We dined here for our 36th wedding anniversary. From the phone call to make the reservations clear through well wishes as we left, it was a masterpiece.
You have three choices-the Brick Room, which is more formal dining, the grill room which has a bar in it, still very nice, if a tiny bit more casual, and the front porch outside. We chose the brick room and it was the right choice for us.
The food was fantastic! Better than anything I have had in New York City, or anywhere else. I had the rack of lamb, prepared perfectly, with the most delicious honey sweet potatoes I have ever had, and french green beans. Hubby had a seafood chowder for starter, and a quail and roast duck entree he said was fabulous. For dessert we shared a flour less chocolate soufflé, with raspberry chocolate truffle ice cream. Our server told us it was gluten free,and her favorite and she did not steer us wrong! IT WAS WONDERFUL! And such a surprise for me to have an option for dessert that was not another creme brûlée or ice cream.
The walls are decorated with the most beautiful paintings by Alexander Volkov.

A genuine delight,"We selected this through a matrix of trip advisor ratings and what was available the day before at the time we wanted for a party our size. It can be surprisingly difficult to get a table in Bethlehem at times. This was 4 miles from where we wanted to be, but as it turns out, worth every tenth mile. What a fabulous place and what incredible food! This is a top notch dining establishment. The decor is the finest I have ever seen anywhere-when I entered, I thought I had inadvertently walked into an upscale spa. We were treated with utmost professional warm friendliness, our special seating request accommodated cheerfully, and attended to by a very competent, if mildly snooty waiter. The steaks are all excellent Black Angus, and cooked perfectly. The salads are huge, I suggest sharing, the sides are special, and also meant for sharing (though not as generous as the salads.) The sea bass was some of the best seafood we have had, and the hollandaise sauce on the asparagus buttery lemon perfection. Hubby tried the mystery wine flight-three two ounce glasses of red or white, you are told after your meal what you had when you tell which one you liked best and why. Fun twist on the usual glass of fine wine.
We were too full for dessert, but after reading the menu, made up our minds to return to this restaurant soon, without waiting for the next event in Bethlehem…yes, this was worth an hour drive just to come to dinner, and that is what we plan to do very soon.
I am disabled, and often experience discomfort or out and out snubbing by nicer restaurants as this, but my treatment here was such that even I forgot for a while that I am disabled. I was as respectfully treated as everyone else in my party or around us. Our young adult daughter especially appreciated the music, and I loved that it was at a volume that allowed enjoyment of the music but easy conversation as well.

"fun, different, and unique","We came to celebrate my son's 30th birthday and it was his choice-and we sure were not disappointed! Every bite of food, every nuance of service, and the beautifully appointed atmosphere was perfection.
I have Celiac, and I appreciated the conscientious awareness and concern they had for me, making sure I knew exactly what I could safely eat and bringing me adaptations where necessary. This is the kind of place where you order a variety of things and share them all around-a few bites of this or that, making for a delightful panoply of flavors and samples from around the world. The menu, which changes seasonally to provide for local fresh ingredients and to add in new dishes rather than overwhelm the menu and kitchen, is divided into world regions. The food is fresh, imaginative and very very tasty.
The servers clearly enjoy being there and act almost as tour guides, taking you through your international experience.
I am told that upstairs, the decor pays homage to its origins as a mortuary with metal stretcher tables and other mildly macabre touches. I was amused downstairs by the toe tag menu touches and formaldehyde type water bottles.
We loved our experience and cannot wait to do it again. while not cheap, it was not overly expensive and was worth every penny.",January 2014,Linger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33388-d2251414-Reviews-Linger-Denver_Colorado.html,"Denver, Colorado",restaurants,5.0,4.5
What a wonderful surprise!,"We went to the museum to see the Passport to Paris exhibit-frankly, I just was not expecting much at all. I have been to the Louvre, the Tate, the Smithsonians, and I live in the NYC area where the Met and others are part of our annual diet. I used to live in Chicago, where we were members of the art institute. I honestly didnt think DAM would have much to impress me. Boy was I shocked! One of the nicest, most pleasant art museum experiences I have EVER had! Very doable size, superb approach to display; each piece feels like the only and most important piece in the museum! HUGE variety of types and styles and genre's, and in every area, there is a hands on corner for kids and adults to try it out for themselves. We took advantage of a free docent led tour and loved it. I could spend hours and hours here and never get bored! The Passport to Paris, with the handheld tourguide device was brilliant, and worth every cent. If we lived here, or visited more often, I would absolutely get a membership as they also have classes, special events such as friday night live music, and background tours available. Everyone was friendly and it was very well marked. I highly recommend this for all ages, and I think this is the perfect place to drag a teenager, to introduce them to art and enjoy the look on their face, and yours when they beg you to go back again! This place is that good.",January 2014,Denver Art Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33388-d128694-Reviews-Denver_Art_Museum-Denver_Colorado.html,"Denver, Colorado",attractions,5.0,4.5
Absolute must,"This is an enjoyable stop for ages 5 and up. (children under five are not allowed on the tour.) Pay attention to the street names as you enter; they are tea names, such as Sleepytime drive. Also, the fields surrounding are filled with prairie dogs popping up, the kids just loved it!!!!
You begin in the tasting room where they give you a china cup to sample hot and iced teas, which they have about twenty urns out to help yourself. In addition, you can ask the servers to sample anything the company sells, including the Kombucha and some teas they only sell at the factory itself. This was a wonderful way to try out some flavors without committing to an entire box!
You then watch an interesting video of the history of the company, followed by a guided tour of the factory itself, where you learn all about tea, herbs, where they buy their supplies, how they clean, mix and test them, etc. My favorite bit is the Peppermint room where the fragrance is pungent and heady and wonderful!!!! The machinery mixing, packaging and palleting the teas is fascinating, as is the distribution information.
It does not bother me at all that it funnels you out through the gift shop. Their teas are all sold in there, along with interesting gifts and treats, I love the gift shop! I load up on teas, which they will ship for you upon request, and help myself to the big deep sale bin of boxes for a dollar! The staff are very friendly and helpful.
They have wheelchairs upon request, there is a cafe there, and this place is something you just cant do anywhere else.

"fresh, delicious, and GF options!","We had a family group party of 7 for dinner. The wait at Efrains was an hour and a half, so when I called here and they said they could seat us right away, I was nervous that the food would not be very good. I was wrong-it was excellent! The waitress was very knowledgeable about what I could safely eat as a Celiac, and advised me very well. We all enjoyed our dinner, the atmosphere was much nicer than what I was expecting, and the prices were very very good. The food was fresh, healthy, and yet quite tasty. I want to come back in the summer, when the large doors are rolled up to the outside! They were friendly and it is a great value-the wait here is what should have been the longer!!!!

Travel ease,"We selected this hotel due to its proximity to DIA-not so close as to feel like planes are landing on you, but close enough to have a fast free shuttle. The hotel is new, in a new area of new hotels, with Hamptons usual excellent quality and attention to detail. We stayed in an accessible room that was a cut above the usual with handheld shower and spacious room and bathroom. The only negatives were a foul odor in the hallway, (but the room smelled fresh and clean.) and a missing hair dryer. Allow extra time for the shuttle-it comes every twenty minutes but ours left early, so we had to wait for the next one. This meant instead of being at the airport at 9:30, we did not arrive until almost ten.",January 2014,Hampton Inn & Suites Denver/Airport-Gateway Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33388-d2309623-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Denver_Airport_Gateway_Park-Denver_Colorado.html,"Denver, Colorado",hotels,5.0,4.5
The only way to go!,"I have never been to a dine in theater before. We chose this because we wanted to see Tosca streamed live from the Met through FathomEvents. This was one of the select theaters, the price was better than the others, and I thought the seats might be more comfortable for a three and a half hour opera. What a fantastic decision! This place was clean, friendly, the seats were super comfortable, and we actually ordered lunch- now THAT is the way to enjoy opera!!! The food was affordable and the quality decent-as good as I have ever gotten at Fridays, Chili's, a diner, or other mid range restaurant. It was such a great experience that I think I will make it my first choice for all movies from now on. My only gripe? The restrooms are pretty far away from the theater we were in. I highly recommend this theater!",November 2013,AMC Dine-In Theatres Essex Green 9,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60796-d3825773-Reviews-AMC_Dine_In_Theatres_Essex_Green_9-West_Orange_New_Jersey.html,"West Orange, New Jersey",attractions,4.0,3.5
one of my favorites,"This restaurant has been our ""go to"" for family celebrations and nicer nights out for a long time. We go for birthdays, anniversaries, get togethers, good report cards, someone got a raise, all kinds of ""special events."" I would say we are there about once a month, for the past 8 years? We go to Roots or Ruths Chris from time to time, but I have to say I cannot see that it is that much better than a comfortable night with good food and down to earth service at Longhorn! I love that they have great steak, the sides are good, and that they are always bringing new things to try. While they do work with you if you are gluten free, I wish they had a few more options as far as appetizers, sides and desserts for us. My favorite is the Outlaw Ribeye. I have never had a bad one yet. We usually have competent friendly service, we have had a few newbies who goofed something up but always fixed it when it was brought to their attention.
The other night my daughter and I went to celebrate straight A's on midterms (any excuse will do!) and had one of the best experiences we have ever had there, all due to a remarkable server named Gina or Jean? She was incredible. I actually spoke to the manager about her, she was so engaging and excellent. After all the times I have been here, and I am fairly critical, and very much a carnivore, I cannot comprehend the complainers. Maybe they should examine their expectations and attitudes.

A DC gem,"We stayed here while visiting washington DC. I selected it because I like the consistency of Hampton Inns, it passed the bed bug registry test, and for being so close to DC in the high season, the rates were very affordable. We needed two rooms for 7 people.
The hotel staff and management here are superior. What a difference it makes to have the people at the front desk so cheerful, friendly, helpful and welcoming! The facility is clean as a whistle throughout. The breakfast area is very nice and was well stocked. The rooms in this hotel are smaller than typical for a Hampton, and there are no queen beds-something I found is the case throughout the DC area! Only King or double. We were very cramped in one room-a king with sofa bed, no room at all for a cot for the teenager. If we were traveling with just two or three, it would be plenty spacious. The rooms were well appointed, exceptionally clean, and quiet. The pool is outdoors, has an accessiblity hoist, there is no hot tub.
This hotel is very near to easy access to the freeway into DC, and near the subway station (there is a free shuttle to the subway/train station) so while traffic is very heavy certain times of day, the access is as good as one can ask. There are many fine restaurants and family restaurants as well as a superb healthy grocery store and a mall nearby.
I was exceptionally pleased with this hotel and plan to make it our home away from home any time we travel to DC.",June 2013,Hampton Inn Alexandria/Pentagon South,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g30226-d83906-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Alexandria_Pentagon_South-Alexandria_Virginia.html,"Alexandria, Virginia",hotels,5.0,4.5

We dined overlooking Bannister's wharf, every morsel of food was excellent-I had the blue cheese bacon burger, hubby had a seafood eggs benedict, Dad had seafood salad, Mom had an egg dish, all was superb.

exceeded expectations,"I made reservations for our 35th wedding anniversary by phone with the most helpful representative ever. She offered me an Ocean front king jacuzzi room at a great price and I jumped on it.
I had read some mixed reviews of this place. Still, it looked like what I was wishing for so decided to give it a try.
I found them to be very friendly and welcoming. We checked in and the bellman told us an easier way to get from parking to our room given my disability. I appreciated that. We were wished a happy anniversary, and she mentioned she was sending up a bottle of champagne!
The location is excellent, right on the sand with a boardwalk leading out. There used to be a line of palm trees, all are cut off a few feet from the ground; not sure if they got too tall and obstructed views or if they suffered hurricane damage. They do look a bit silly. The view of the ocean from our room was wonderful, but to my disappointment, the balcony is NOT ocean front, but ocean view, from the side. Because ours was right on the patio with the hot tubs outside the pool and lounge area, we did not use it as we felt like we were in a fishbowl, and it was noisy. I was really sad about that. I had so counted on early morning coffee looking out to sea.
The room was clean as a whistle, no complaints there at all, but a bit worn and dated. The chair was so stained I could not bring myself to sit in it. The bed, a tempurpedic, was clean, newer, and very comfortable. The kitchenette was well stocked and there was a full size fridge. Good to know for a future visit. The heart shaped jacuzzi tub was great, and worked very well, although it is worn and stained, and the carpet around it is worn and shabby.
I was thinking on the days we were there that if I ever came back, I would beg for a room higher up-we were looking forward to a quiet romantic retreat, but the noise from the adjacent pool, and the early morning shouts of children swimming or on the beach was hard for us. If we had been higher up, it would have been perfect.
We found out when we checked out, that we had been charged for the champagne, and when we disputed it, discovered that we had originally been slated for a fifth floor room, which would have been perfect, and was apparently nicer, but that the owners had extended their stay and bumped us to one of the lower hotel rooms. I almost cried. Our weekend was lovely, but it could have been perfect!! They did deduct the champagne; apparently our free bottle was sent to the original room, lol, so the one we got was thought to be a second order.
If not for knowing that, I would probably not come back-maybe check out one of the other nice resorts we saw along the strip-but because they were so nice, and because it might have been better if the people had not bumped us, we are thinking of giving it another try, maybe in September for my birthday. What I care most about is safe, clean, good service and easy parking, and we had all that, plus an ocean view. I think you will like it.",April 2013,Princess Royale Oceanfront Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g41298-d89489-Reviews-Princess_Royale_Oceanfront_Resort-Ocean_City_Maryland.html,"Ocean City, Maryland",hotels,4.0,4.5
a delightful trip,"On a weekend trip to Ocean City MD, we decided to drive down the Jersey shore and spend the afternoon in Cape May, then take the ferry across. We had never done this before, thinking that the expense was ridiculous given that we could drive the long way around for ""free.""
SO GLAD we took the ferry! We chose the 6 o:clock ferry after an afternoon of lunch and walking the shops in Cape May, waited in line at the ferry where when we checked in we were given a happy anniversary card! When I made the reservations, they asked if I had any coupons, or was with a group, and I said no, just the two of us on our 35th wedding anniversary getaway. They remembered that and several signed a card to give us when we checked in, along with a free drink coupon!
We so enjoyed sitting outside with the gentle rolling watching the sunset. Saw some dolphins (which the captain announced over the pa system.) and then went inside for the remainder of the trip. It was such a restful, pleasant interlude in our busy day, we could stroll, chat, snack, and all the while enjoy the gentle rolling, the sea, the sunset. It was a bit pricey at $38, but in my opinion it was worth every penny!
The loading was quick and efficient. The only thing to know is that the stairway up from the parking deck to services was steep and long. There is an elevator if you need it with advance notice. Also, take a jacket...it can get breezy and chilly even on a warm day and you dont want to have to go all the way back down, and shinny between the cars to get yours.",April 2013,Cape May-Lewes Ferry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34028-d1172802-Reviews-Cape_May_Lewes_Ferry-Lewes_Delaware.html,"Lewes, Delaware",attractions,4.0,4.5
Pleasant luncheon,"We had a list of the five best places to eat from Tripadvisor in hand, when we arrived in Cape May looking for lunch. We had tried to find George's, but turned out the GPS directions are wrong, and when we called to correct them, found out they were not yet opening for lunch in the season. Disappointed, we decided to look for parking and wander the shops. We found a spot and right in front of us was the back of Tisha's, with its patio seating. Checked the menu and decided it was worth a try. Loved it! Husband had crab cakes, I had a fantastic burger, the service was superb and friendly, it was a lovely day to be on the patio smelling the sea air.

Still my favorite exchange,"This was our second experience with this property, our first was in January of 2009. We were delighted once again. Check in was fast, friendly, and organized. We had a three bedroom-be advised! This three bedroom, which was absolutely gorgeous, was actually a two bedroom with a loft. The loft, which technically overlooks the living room, was spacious and had two twin beds, and would be perfect for kids. We had two adults staying up there, and they were very comfortable, but when anyone is up downstairs, lights are on and noise goes right there. The master suite was incredible with a jacuzzi the size of a small pool, and a freestanding shower and separate toilet. The other bedroom was huge, with two queens, attached to a beautiful bathroom.
Full kitchen, washer dryer, and screened balcony overlooking grounds and pond made it perfect.
The resort is amazing, with 14 pools, onsite restaurants, quick store, deli, krispy kreme, game room, movies, and security. They have tennis, horseshoes, paddleboats, all kinds of things we never used because we were at the Disney parks all day. parking was excellent.
My one and only complaint, and it is a big one, is the EGREGIOUS fees for wifi. SERIOUSLY, in this day and age, it feels like absolute terrorism to charge anything at all, much less 10 dollars a day, for wifi. It is free for owners, but NOT exchangers. It left a very bitter taste in my mouth. Other than that, from BOTH my experiences here, it is as close to perfect as anywhere we have ever stayed.",February 2013,Westgate Vacation Villas Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34352-d84886-Reviews-Westgate_Vacation_Villas_Resort-Kissimmee_Florida.html,"Kissimmee, Florida",hotels,4.0,3.5
Perfect experience worth every penny.,"We tried to get reservations here on our previous visits to WDW and it was booked. I booked well in advance this time, and now I understand why it is so popular. This was the consummate experience-perfect service, excellent atmosphere, and superb food. Canadian french style food, some of the best steak I have ever eaten, and they provided for me, who is gluten free, the best rolls I have ever eaten. The maple creme brulee is the perfect topper for the meal-it was absolutely delectable. You MUST have the potatoes poutine. The description-french fries with reduction sauce and cheese-sounds iffy.

it gets better and better!,"We have been eating at The Old Spaghetti factory since we lived in Denver in the 1980's. We loved it then, and though we moved, we make it one of our first choices when we visit Denver. I love the ambience-the quirky decor, stained glass, the railroad car inside, the tucked away booths. But the Spaghetti, most particularly the Mizthra cheese and browned butter, is incredible. To my delight, they now have an extensive Gluten Free menu, so I was able to enjoy my old favorite even though I was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease. Our server was excellent, and the food was served hot and delicious, and the cream sodas (you get to keep the glass!) are delightful.
