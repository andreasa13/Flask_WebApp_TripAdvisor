"great location, disappointing service","I am a Hilton Gold member and we recently stayed for multiple nights at this property. It is in an excellent location with great views of the ocean. However, the service is lackluster (as it is in all of Panama, really). We had called ahead of time and emailed the hotel for specific bedding requests and were assured that everything was in order. On arrival, on checking, we were told again, that our requests were taken care of, but, of course when we get to the room, our bedding request had not been taken care of. It took an extra hour after check in and multiple requests to even get some one to come up.
In addition, even though we were Thanked for our loyalty to Hilton based on our time share ownership and Gold status with Hilton Honors, not once were we told the location of, or invited to the Executive lounge at check in- a privilege accorded to us at every Hilton worldwide.It was left to us and a wonderful lounge attendant to figure out the location etc
The service in the restaurants similarly, was variable. The wait for a server to come to the table was uniformly long once seated, service times were again variable, once orders had been placed. The Bell persons were hit or miss, sometimes they would be available for help; at others they could not be located at all.
The sad part is that this could be, with some attention, a great Hilton in Latin America. The rooms were wonderful, the location is outstanding and the place is generally well kept ; we just wish the service matched the other aspects of the Hotel.",December 2019,Hilton Panama,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294480-d6562541-Reviews-Hilton_Panama-Panama_City_Panama_Province.html,"Panama City, Panama",hotels,3.0,4.5

Fantastic,"This is one of the great boutique hotels in the world in my opinion. We were here for 3 nights and the polite staff, attentive service and great food totally blew us away. The rooms are charming and the facilities are more than adequate.
Of note, one of the members of our party was quite ill for 2 days, and the service provided as well as the kindness shown by the staff was something you would not seen in a hospital!

Good airline,"The plane was well kept and clean, leg room was adequate and boarding was efficient. Two things however , cast a shadow on an otherwise excellent flight: one departure was delayed from Cairo for reasons unknown and no announcement was made for many minutes that the flight was delayed. Second, the announcements on the plane by the staff were unintelligible. I understand that English was perhaps not the first language for the staff, but it was hard to understand even a few words, the accent was extremely heavy. Now, I don’t think that the announcements were of great importance on the plane, but if there was an emergency, I don’t think that many passengers on the flight would have been able to follow instructions, most of them being Western tourists.",May 2019,Royal Jordanian,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729138-Reviews-Royal-Jordanian,World,flights,4.0,3.0
Adequate,"Egypt Air has been an airline I have dreaded to fly in all the years I have been flying all over the world. On my recent trip to Egypt, I had no choice to fly them, and, I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. The planes(s) were comfortable, clean and appeared to be well maintained. The restroom was basic, with minimal but adequate amenities for Economy class. The flights were on time and generally the service was courteous and professional.

Excellent airline,"Great service and excellent onboard cuisine was we found on our recent trip from Amman to Istanbul and then on to Chicago. The staff were courteous, the planes although slightly older, were well maintained and clean. Onboard entertainment was adequate. The cuisine was fantastic with the presence of an onboard chef from Istanbul to Chicago. Departure and arrival were on time and overall, the journey was A Plus.

Excellent company,"Untame Belize is a your company which operates hotels, provides excursions and provides transportation services in Belize. We booked 2 transfers and an excursion with this company and were greatly satisfied with the service.
The owner is a native of Belize and his responsiveness and service were excellent.
We took an excursion with this company’s tour guide Edgar and greatly enjoyed it. His careful driving, attention to detail and knowledge of historical sites was much appreciated. He was always cheerful, kept the vehicle clean and had a great sense of humor.

Mixed bag,"This resort has a lot of potential, situated as it is on a private island. Sadly, it does not live up to its potential and leaves a traveller only disappointed.

Pros: Ideal location, limited number of people, Excellent staff.
Cons: Poor maintainence, horrible food, rooms (some) are poorly designed, Overpriced excursions.Poor communication within the organization

There are many reviews on this forum which praise this resort, so I will not discuss the Pros further, I will, however discuss the shortcomings as I saw them, in an effort to improve the functioning of this resort.

Poor Maintainence: We were 2 couples who arrived on this island after a rather harrowing boat ride through 6 foot waves because of a minor storm. We were completely soaked and cold. We were taken to our rooms, which were disappointingly designed(more later) and found that we had no hot water to take a shower after being completely drenched in cold salt water. We took cold showers and reported this to management an hour later. we were informed during dinner that the problem was fixed. The next morning we had no hot water again and it was still cold outside. To make a long story short, it took the management almost 36 hours to “fix” a problem.On another day a guest on the island told us he fell into the water walking around near an overwater bar when a rotted plank on the walkway broke under him. In addition there was too much accumulated rotting vegetation on the island to make walking around on this island a pleasant experience. Walkways around the island were poorly maintained and poorly lit.We were told by the manager that there were improvement”plans” in the works, but, other than increasing the number of rooms, we don’t believe there were any concrete plans for improvement.

Horrible food: This is a real shortcoming. There literally was no choice offered. One entree was allowed at each meal, the dishes were uninspiring, not flavorful and on most occasions were served cold. Happy hour was characterized by free flowing liquor but the appetizers were either chips and salsa, cold sausages and hot dogs in canned tomato sauce and a variety of unflavorful ,cold pastries of some sort. On one day , a member of our party was tired of the bad food and asked for a grilled cheese sandwich or a PBJ and was told that there was no bread! Imagine a resort without a loaf of bread.

We were booked into what were called ""ocean facing cabanas” and while the location was good, the rooms were tiny and were completely taken up up by the bed. There was no place to hang any clothes or outerwear. There were drawers under the bed, but that's hardly the place for hanging wet outerwear.The rooms were poorly appointed and other than a water Jar and had no coffee/tea makers or supplies. There were no places to hang anything in the bathroom. Finally , there was no place to sit in the room! If you wanted to read or listen to music quietly, you had to sit on the bed or outside on the Patio. The tiny room did not even have place for a chair. The solution IMHO for these rooms which were side by side is that they should both be combined into one room, to at least chair to be put in the room and allow for quiet relaxation inside. To be honest, we asked the manager to be moved if possible, and were taken on a tour of the property’s rooms . These were much better designed and equipped , however they were apparently all booked. We obtained our rooms after bidding at a charity auction and therefore were reluctant to push further in an effort to keep the charity out of an unpleasant situation for us.

Overpriced excursions: The snorkeling and dive excursions as well as island tours were priced at least 20-30% higher than comparable offerings elsewhere.

Poor communication: the resort offers shuttle boat transfer from the mainland, and while we understand that weather conditions dictate where they dock, communicating this to the guests is essential. We were initially told to assemble at a resort on the mainland for our transfer to the island and arrived there to be told that because of the weather the transfer skiff would dock about 30-40 minutes away. This was fine and we were transferred to the other dock without incident. On our return, the weather was perfect and we assumed that we would be returned to our original docking point on the mainland. We therefore made arrangements with a driver to pick up at the mainland resort and transfer us to the international airport in Belize city which was a 2 hour drive away. We checked with the staff at the island regarding the times of departure , arrival at the dock and whether we would have adequate time for the land transfer etc and were assured everything was fine. Imagine our surprise, therefore, when the return skiff docked not at the mainland resort but at the alternative dock and our driver was now 30-40 minutes away waiting for us. We asked to be driven to the mainland resort and were accommodated, but a little more communication that morning would have led to less stress and worry not to mention the driver wondering what had happened. Its important that when plans change, the resort informs its guests ahead of time, although we could not understand why the skiff could not dock at the original location as the weather was excellent.

This resort prides itself as being of the "" casual luxury/barefoot elegant” variety. Based on our experience, it is neither luxurious nor elegant. We have stayed at a number of such resorts all over the world and this resort at best is a poor imitator. I take no pride in this poor review, but, it is my hope that management takes these issues seriously.",December 2018,"Thatch Caye, a Muy'Ono Resort",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g5921325-d1015315-Reviews-Thatch_Caye_a_Muy_Ono_Resort-Coco_Plum_Cay_Belize_Cayes.html,"Coco Plum Cay, Belize",hotels,2.0,4.5
A museum to see on rainy day,"The Blanton Museum of art is located on the University of Texas Campus in Austin. This small museum focuses mostly on Latin American and Southwestern Art. There are a few interesting paintings mostly from Mexico and Latin America. There are however, special exhibits that focus on the art of other areas of the world. These special exhibits are separately priced and depending on the exhibit are sometimes very interesting.
The entrance to museum is reasonable and if you are affiliated with the University of texas system as a student , employee or faculty admission is either free or discounted. There is plenty of parking in the area and there is a small cafe with decent offerings.
All in all, if its a rainy day in Austin and you want to do something, this is the place for you.",April 2018,The Blanton Museum of Art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30196-d139504-Reviews-The_Blanton_Museum_of_Art-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",attractions,3.0,4.5
Texas in a nutshell,"This museum, located next to the University of Texas at Austin, is perhaps the most interesting museum in Austin for all ages. It is extremely well signposted with a good mix of dioramas and interactive exhibits. The multimedia shows are very good, although they cost extra. I would highly recommend it to visitors from outside of Texas for a quick and informative introduction to the state of Texas.
PS: Until a few years ago they also had an IMAX movie called “Texas- the big picture” which although a little cheesy, was extremely beloved by my younger guests. I really wish they had something to replace this movie.",December 2017,Bullock Texas State History Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30196-d209385-Reviews-Bullock_Texas_State_History_Museum-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",attractions,4.0,4.5
Iconic Hotel,"This resort, a historic and popular resort in Arizona is sprawling, friendly and extremely relaxing. On a recent visit, check in was smooth with both valet and self parking available. The rooms in the original wing although charming may feel a little small. The other wings are more spacious especially for families.
Highly recommended is a stay in the Ocatillo wing which provides access to the lounge and included breakfast as well as evening canapés and complimentary wine and beer.
The pools are great ( there are 8 pools I think) including the historic Catalina pool which was a favorite of Hollywood stars in previous eras.
Kids and pets are well catered for, and , during holidays and in the summer many programs exist to entertain children.
The restaurants and bars are fun and extremely atmospheric with contemporary and classic dishes. This is the birthplace of a number of classic cocktails and I highly recommend the Tequila sunrise. Also highly recommended is the fun , free and informative history tour which takes you behind the historic facade of the hotel. Another activity which I highly recommend is the afternoon tea which on a recent visit was curated by Kevin Doyle who described himself as a tea Sommelier. He was knowledgeable, attentive and led us through an exquisite afternoon activity. A must if you are a fan of the tea tradition.
Finally, if you are a hosting a special event such as a wedding , there are few places in the southwest which are better.",October 2018,"Arizona Biltmore, A Waldorf Astoria Resort",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g31310-d115484-Reviews-Arizona_Biltmore_A_Waldorf_Astoria_Resort-Phoenix_Arizona.html,"Phoenix, Arizona",hotels,5.0,4.5
Wonderful service,"Dunia camp is a southern Serengeti camp operated by Asilia. This company is very eco conscious and from what I have read is a great employer. We loved the open camp plan with it's proximity to wildlife. We could actually hear Buffalo and lions at night close to our tents. Some lions had actually killed a buffalo the previous night to our arrival about 80 yards away from one of the tents.
We initially were a little nervous but after we settled down we realized what a great experience the stay was at this camp.
The tents themselves were comfortable and spacious. The food was very good and the staff were eager to please and extremely friendly. We would love to return and are extremely grateful to all the women who run this camp.
Don't however walk away from camp and do not walk alone back to your tent without an escort. While we were leaving the camp there were elephants less than a quarter mile from camp on the road and there were lions in the grass about 100-200 yards from camp.

Convenient,"This is a new extremely convenient hotel if you have a long layover in Vienna. It's literally across the street from the airport terminal and you can walk across without trouble. The Vienna airport train station is a few metres away from the lobby and is convenient if you are going to the city.

The rooms are airport basic but serve their purpose
The restaurant has a decent breakfast , we did not have any other meals there.

The staff are friendly and helpful and usually go the extra mile to provide help when needed.

The only thing that we were not fans of was the extra they charge for early check in. Considering that this is an airport hotel and flights may arrive in the early morning, they should not expect that travellers would wait in the lobby until the 2 or 3 pm check in time. On the other hand, they tell you this ahead of time so it's not really a surprise. I just wish that they would change to a 24 check in system given their location.",July 2018,NH Vienna Airport Conference Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190454-d228063-Reviews-NH_Vienna_Airport_Conference_Center-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",hotels,4.0,4.0
Very good hotel,"We stayed here as a family in June and were impressed. We were warmly received and shown promptly to our rooms after a fairly easy and quick check in. The rooms are very large for a city hotel and we'll appointed. The shower water pressure was good and the breakfast was of a high standard.

The location is convenient and there is a free shuttle that will take you downtown. The staff however are the highlight of this hotel. Most city hotels have staff that are rushed St best and grumpy at their worst in my opinion. This jotel's staff were however a delight to interact with. From the concierge who was extremely courteous and helpful to the bellmen who gave us great advice on authentic Greek restaurants everyone was wonderful.
