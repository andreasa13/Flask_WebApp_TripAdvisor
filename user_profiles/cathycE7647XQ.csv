Just go!,"Am pretty sure most people go while in Athens but buy your combo ticket at the temple of Zeus where there may not be a lineup to purchase. Once you have your ticket then you bypass all other lineups to go straight to scanning in! No wait!
Also we were travelling on our own so we managed to avoid the crowds by heading up around lunch time. Not too hot the day we went! We could have gone later in the day with no crowds also. Absolutely worth the walk up but be smart - wear your walking shoes, sun hat and take water! That way you will really enjoy!",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Awesome!,"Just go - it’s too hard to describe other than awesome - and I am not usually a museum lover.
The archaeological site beneath the museum is quite incredible as well.",September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Thieves!,"Nice touristy area with restaurants and shops. However, my iPhone was stolen here. The locals all know the routine of the thieves. Drop a map in front of you and start yelling and pointing at the map. While you are in shock they steal whatever is under the map! My iPhone was actually under my husband’s big camera!
Can spoil your time in Plaka in a hurry. Be especially careful after buying something- they will watch to see where the wallet returns to.....",September 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
wonderful food,Had the mixed grill for 4 with the loser salad - recommended by waitress and it was awesome. The second time we had greek salad and pasta and grilled chicken. Once again great food and the service is friendly and polite.,September 2019,Lostre Kouzina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6765593-Reviews-Lostre_Kouzina-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Interesting coffee shop!,Great coffee and a nice place to sit and relax. Local art work everywhere you look.It is an amazing space as you can still tell that it was a church at one time. Enjoyable visit.,August 2018,Resurrect Art Coffee House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60873-d2701953-Reviews-Resurrect_Art_Coffee_House-Seward_Alaska.html,"Seward, Alaska",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent Decaf!,So hard to get a quality taste in a decaf but this caffe has the best! They also have a great assortment of mugs and then there is the baked goods........ A wonderful experience. Just go!,July 2018,Revel Caffe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155015-d2243843-Reviews-Revel_Caffe-Stratford_Ontario.html,"Stratford, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Best kept secret!,Away from the Main Street tourist area it is worth finding this place. The menu for breakfast offers many choices but more importantly gives you the chance to have smaller portions. There are always awesome baked goods but the skillets are just the right size and excellent. It gets very busy and you might have to wait for a table but it is well worth the wait. The atmosphere is small town and very enjoyable!,July 2018,Brenda's Place & Bakery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155015-d13996740-Reviews-Brenda_s_Place_Bakery-Stratford_Ontario.html,"Stratford, Canada",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Always excellent!,"Always great service and food at this location.
Have visited with just my husband but also with a group of eight.

Very Disappointed!,"We were in Seville for one week with another couple. We had been looking forward to a carriage ride for several days. A driver, speaking English, approached us and explained the tour and the price. It soon became evident that his English was not up to the level of a tour guide! We looked at his carriage and asked if 4 people would fit. He said YES. However, after less than a minute we realized that this was going to be terrible for us all. While my husband is tall the rest of us are small people. There was NO leg room so my husband had both feet out on the step of the carriage and actually rode beside the driver while we visited the park. The smaller seat faces backwards and is horribly uncomfortable and makes it difficult to see the sights. We wiggled around and tried to get comfortable but it was impossible. Our driver did tell us the name of the sights and took photos of us at the Plaza but between those times he talked on his cell phone. Sorry that is NOT good service. When we returned he asked if we liked the tour and I said you should NEVER have taken 4 people in your carriage as there is not enough room for anyone to enjoy the trip! After walking around today and noticing the carriages - many of them are not suitable for 4 people - even the ones with better seats are still very short on leg room. So if you would like a comfortable, romantic buggy ride where you can actually sit beside your husband - check out the seats in the carriage FIRST! or just decide that only 2 can go in one carriage! or just enjoy looking at them...........",March 2017,Horse & Carriage Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187443-d2587905-Reviews-Horse_Carriage_Tour-Seville_Province_of_Seville_Andalucia.html,"Seville, Spain",attractions,1.0,3.5
Must Eat here!,If you love tapas then you must eat here! We arrived at 7:15 before it became packed with locals and tourists. We ate here twice during our stay in Sevilla and the 4 of us tried most of their selections plus the red wine. Excellent! The second time we had a delightful waitress who was willing to give our table separate cheques. Would definitely recommend!,March 2017,Restaurante Eslava,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187443-d984924-Reviews-Restaurante_Eslava-Seville_Province_of_Seville_Andalucia.html,"Seville, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Quality!,"Olga at the front desk was very welcoming and called to make sure our room was fine. Wonderful clean, fairly new room - excellent bedding.

Nice atmosphere - too bad the company uses cheap ingredients!,Great waitress! The ingredients in just about everything used by this chain are processed - so I went for the fruit and yogurt plate. Unfortunately they are still using MSG when so many progressive restaurants like Cracker Barrel have eliminated this. Will not come back until they really take an interest in preparing quality food for their customers.,April 2012,Bob Evans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34678-d466676-Reviews-Bob_Evans-Tampa_Florida.html,"Tampa, Florida",restaurants,2.0,4.0
