Good hotel alongside the sea and the boulevard,Good hotel just beside hotel Hilton about 30 minutes drive from the airport. We chose a seaview room on the 7th floor and got a beautiful view of the sea and the boulevard. The room and bathroom size were smaller than expected. Most of attractions in Baku city is close by. Two malls and Nizami street are at walking distance. The staff were friendly but only a few speak English.
