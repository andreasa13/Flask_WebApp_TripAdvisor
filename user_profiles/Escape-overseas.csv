Definitely 5* for this leg of our flight.,"For the final leg of our long journey, the third of the flights with Avianca, we were upgraded to business class, which was a pleasant surprise. Although we hold Platinum status as frequent flyers the opportunities for complimentary upgrades get less and less as airlines consolidate flights and often fly full. A real boost to a long journey sipping champagne to celebrate our return to the Galapagos - definitely 5* for this leg of our flight.",January 2020,Avianca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729028-Reviews-Avianca,World,flights,5.0,4.0
Great location for the early morning ferries.,"Located very close to the harbour we chose the hotel for an overnight stay to facilitate an evening arrival by ferry from one of the islands and the early morning ferry to another the following day. A previous stay, a couple of years ago, had been disappointing, but it best served our purpose this time around so booked anyway.
I am glad to report that the negatives found during our previous trip have been turned into positives. English speaking receptionist, assistance with luggage and a great breakfast served in time to catch the morning ferry. Fast check in and out - all just what we booked with no issues - great location for fast access to the ferries without the need for a taxis and of course being located close to the harbour, well located for shops and restaurants for evening entertainment.",January 2020,Hotel Ninfa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297533-d1182725-Reviews-Hotel_Ninfa-Puerto_Ayora_Santa_Cruz_Galapagos_Islands.html,"Santa Cruz, Ecuador",hotels,4.0,3.5
Just an all round great place to stay,"Having stayed here before we said we would return and so we did. Captain Max is an excellent host, keen to ensure all his guests get the most of their visit to the island. The accommodation is centrally located so all you need is within a short walk.
The rooms are lovingly arrange around a nautical theme with comfortable beds and air conditioning and come complete with a hammock if that 'rocks your boat'.

A vibrant sculptural celebration,A landmark enroute to the Darwin Research Centre and a rather vibrant reminder and tribute to what this island group means to the world at large in our understanding of evolution based on the work of Charles Darwin.,January 2020,Monumento Darwin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297533-d13200730-Reviews-Monumento_Darwin-Puerto_Ayora_Santa_Cruz_Galapagos_Islands.html,"Santa Cruz, Ecuador",attractions,4.0,3.5
The central hub of any visit,"A long journey fro the UK, but worth every hour of the 29 hours spent getting there, door to door. Located in the centre of the island group it provides a good kicking off spot to explore the other islands. This island is the only one with a road running through it's centre, providing connection between Baltra island airport to the north and the port, which is Santa Cruz, to the south. The town is more established than the population settlements on the other islands and as such has one of the more developed tourist industry, providing numerous restaurants, accommodation, dive shops etc from which to plan your stay within the Galapagos. As such we chose to avoid the busy periods to get away from the crowds, although i understand the islands are implementing a policy of sustainable tourism by increasing the price to enter the region from $100 to $400 per person at some time in 2020 to assist in controlling the growth in the number of visitors. To experience this island we plan 3 to 4 days to visit the sights, having visited previously, before moving on to other islands within the group. If moving between islands you will likely pass through several times during your stay since some islands are only accessible by ferries from this port. To make the most of your visit to the Galapagos plan your visit in advance to make the most of the time available to you - this is a lovely island, but only one of many, with different wildlife on the islands and in the ocean, throughout the group, so traveling between the islands is an essential part of any visit.",January 2020,Santa Cruz Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297532-d10841626-Reviews-Santa_Cruz_Island-Santa_Cruz_Galapagos_Islands.html,"Santa Cruz, Ecuador",attractions,5.0,4.5
Walk into pure bliss,"The location is well signposted from the town, and although a bit of a walk it is well worth it. The path leads up a series of steps to a ranger station and on through the typical volcanic landscape of Opuntia cactus 'trees', with numerous small lizards scurrying to keep you company. The reward at the end of the path is a vast sandy beach, extending as far as the eye can see, speckled with a few people here and there, and of course iguanas sunning themselves as they absorb the heat of the day. Keep an eye on the flags to judge whether or not it is advisable to swim - safety is your own responsibility. There are no life guards on this beach.
Further along is the Tortuga Laguna where you are able to snorkel, swim and kayak, somewhat more protected by the bay and outlying reef.",January 2020,Galapagos Beach at Tortuga Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297532-d2511723-Reviews-Galapagos_Beach_at_Tortuga_Bay-Santa_Cruz_Galapagos_Islands.html,"Santa Cruz, Ecuador",attractions,5.0,4.5

"The local's enjoy the area, but there are better beaches available","A relatively small beach, obviously in demand by local families who seem to occupy both the beach and its boardwalk. The area is accessed by an 80c water taxis ride from the main pier across the bay, followed by and a short walk.

The centre of activity as the water taxis come and go,"A walk along the 'Malecon' is to walk along the main street adjacent to the sea, with restaurants, jewelry shops, tourist gift stores, holiday accommodation, tour agents and the like facing the sea. With the inter-island boats collecting and offloading passengers, water taxis form the vital link to the larger speed boats and to the beach and hotel area to the east of the bay. The local sea inhabitants take precedence over bench seats and form the 'sea lion' photo attraction. Elsewhere iguanas sun themselves away from the daily hustle. The skate board park provides for local sport activity, including volley ball and evening music, providing the opportunity for social gatherings. Taxis park up waiting for their next fair, although if you stay close to this area they aren't really needed to access the general tourist activities, which are mostly within walking distance.",January 2020,Malecon de Puerto Ayora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297533-d13161100-Reviews-Malecon_de_Puerto_Ayora-Puerto_Ayora_Santa_Cruz_Galapagos_Islands.html,"Santa Cruz, Ecuador",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice visit but came away empty handed - maybe next time,"The gallery is eye catching, located on the corner of the road, facing you as you return from the Darwin Research Center. My eye was drawn to the woven tapestries in the window, with an extensive range of patterns and sizes within the store. We established that they were from Peru and as such were likely to be a lot more expensive than available on the mainland. as such it made little sense to lug one around during our island hoping trip.

"Pleasant flight, but 'no night' time refreshments","Our journey to Ecuador stated with the first of three flights with Avianca. The boarding process and general flight was uneventful, other than a slightly delayed departure once on board, with an attentive cabin crew. During the 'night' there was no one to be seen and no routine pass through the cabin with water or refreshments for those who remained awake, unlike other airlines.

"Wow, and all for free, some of the best snorkeling on the island","Don't underestimate some of the things that are available for free. A visit to Concha de Perla, adjacent to the main harbour. provides the opportunity to swim with playful sea lions, marine Iguana, and numerous colourful fish, and then if you are lucky, sea turtles, stringray, both Marbel and spotted and white tipped reef sharks. The more times you visit the more likely you are to experience the full range of sea life that we recorded during our trip. For us it took three visits, but wow, and all for free. You can book snorkeling tours and travel around the coast, at significant cost and see a lot less - well maybe.
The depth of the water of course varies with the tide, and we swam both at high and low tide. In the end what you see is just luck. The huge Marbel Ray, sitting on the bottom, was seen at low tide, but at high tide we saw the reef shark, turtle and swam just above three spotted rays, all swimming in close formation. As for Iguana and sea lions, well they are just everywhere whilst the sun is up.

Los Tuneles Tour with this company should be on your agenda,"Having utilised this company on our previous visit to the island, almost 2 years ago, and been suitably impressed, I tried contacting by email to pre-arrange a tour to Los Tuneles. Unfortunately I received no response and could only make arrangements once on the island. Never-the-less we were able to arrange for the trip on a date to suit and we were again impressed by the service, quality of equipment provided for the snorkeling, the agreed price for the three of us, the lunch and refreshments included, the boat crew, who remained attentive throughout, and most of all the guide who accompanied us, both for the land tour and in the water.
This is an amazing location and we were fortunate, through the knowledge of the guide, to see courting Blue Footed Boobies, with several other birds, and swim with numerous giant turtles, white tipped reef sharks and, what was a first for me, sea horses.
My previous review advised that if you are to do any trip, then was the one to do, and this is most definitely the tour company to do it with. They use their own boat and staff, and apart from the lack of email response to pre-book, the service was faultless. The guide even uses his own 'go-pro' to record the trip and will happily download a copy to your own device or storage card upon return to base.
When we return to the island, as we most surely will, this tour, with this company, will be on our agenda.",January 2020,Pahoehoe Galapagos Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297525-d11741551-Reviews-Pahoehoe_Galapagos_Tours-Isabela_Galapagos_Islands.html,"Isabela, Ecuador",attractions,5.0,5.0

Disappointing - give it a miss,"Lots of positive reviews but it didnt live up to our expectation. We selected mains and after some time we were told the choice of one was not available.

The risotto was tasteless and we assume had been prepared with frozen vegetables. White fish was salty.

Good choice of hotel.,"Well located for shopping, beach and restaurants. Upon checking in we were advised that our key card would also double as a ticket on the trolley bus service serving Ala Mona Shopping Center - bonus. For our trips to the beach or snorkeling the hotel proved towels and even a tote bag to carry them in. Room was good, service at the hotel very good, checking us in early, having arrived on a morning flight.

Sometimes the impromptu events are the best.,"We had a family friend phone to say he was at the station and had 2.5 hours before his next train. With Firejacks just down the steps from the railway station we arranged to meet for dinner and met up 15 minutes later. It was early evening and, relatively quiet, and so we sat in a booth to catch up. We all ordered steaks, which were all well prepared to each of our requirements, tender and juicy. Service was excellent. We finished with coffee in time for the train connection. Sometimes the impromptu events are the best.",November 2019,Firejacks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190726-d14210092-Reviews-Firejacks-Stevenage_Hertfordshire_England.html,"Stevenage, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Not up to standard - shame on you,"Not up to standard. I'm not sure whats happening at United but this was the 4th flight we have taken with this airline in the past two weeks and on 50% of those flights there were problems with the personal entertainment systems, including missing plug jacks and defective armrest operators. To add insult to injury the one of the flight crew spilt tomatoe juice over my son, whilst the cabin was in darkness, and hoped to get away without an apology.

Glad to be back,"This is still my 'go to' place in Kona, despite problems on a previous visit. At one time we were regular visitors, but we hadn't returned here in almost 3 years and I missed the casual vibe and the ability to watch the ocean from our balcony, sit, relax and read a book, or walk to one of many local restaurants.

Should be nicer than it was,"From the outside it looked like a nice venue for lunch, but I think we chose the wrong day. There was a large group of people celebrating a birthday and they certainly didn't have a noise filter. Fortunately we were seated some distance away, others dinners moved to more remote tables to get away from the noise. How management thought this acceptable I do not know. Food was ok, service adequate.

Even in this modern world somethings never change.,"Powell and Market Street is the start of the Cable Car journey over to Fisherman's Wharf. Having descended on the cable system, a few movements of the control levers releases the car to allow it to be manually rotated on the turntable, and having been turned through 180 degrees, re-engaged for the return journey over the hill. Whilst queuing for the ride it adds a little entertainment and is something I'm not sure you will see anywhere else during your travels.",October 2019,Powell and Market Cable Car Turnaround,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d3670548-Reviews-Powell_and_Market_Cable_Car_Turnaround-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,4.0,4.0
Hang off the side of the car for the true experience,"No visit to San Francisco would be complete without a ride on the cable car, and since this was a first time visit for our son, it was high on the list of things to do. We queued at the start of the run, at the junction of Powell Street and Market Street, having obtained $7 one way tickets from the nearby ticket booth. For the true ride experience, if you are able, stand alongside the seated passengers at the front of the car - all rather iconic. If your heading over the hill down to Fisherman's Wharf it's going to take a while. This time around the car failed to grip the underground cable at the base of one of the inclines along the way, but this clearly wasn't a first, as the operator radioed in. A short time later a truck pulled up at the rear and pushed us uphill until the cable system re-engaged, adding to the experience.",October 2019,Cable Cars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d104821-Reviews-Cable_Cars-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Lunch by the ocean, with Happy Hour","When in Kona our hotel is next door, so we have passed by dozens of times and never stopped to eat, although I'm not sure why. On this occasion we did and sitting under the shade of a large umbrella, on a typical sunny day, with our feet on the sand filled raised patio, we ordered a late lunch. By the time we had finished happy hour was upon us and so we stayed a while longer. We had a great lunch and thoroughly enjoyed our relaxed visit, watching out over the ocean. I guess we've been missing out and we will definitely return.",October 2019,Huggo's On The Rocks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60872-d634615-Reviews-Huggo_s_On_The_Rocks-Kailua_Kona_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good home made food,"Home made food appears to be the specialty here. Driving along the coast road back to Kona form the Volcano National Park we saw the sign advertising the most Southerly restaurant in America and stopped for a break.

"Dinner, whilst spotting with Manta Ray","We visited for dinner to coincide with Manta Ray spotting along the viewing area and from our table in the open air restaurant. Initially there were lots of boats milling around so we felt the chance of a sighting was slim and indeed only spotted one, briefly.
having sat down at our table the boats moved away and sure enough a manta ray came to play, or rather eat, within the bay swimming around for almost 30 minutes, joined later by another. Whilst the spectacle interrupted our meal somewhat, this is what we had come to see and made it all the more enjoyable. The table service was good, the food well cooked and prepared - successful evening.",October 2019,Rays on the Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60872-d3473261-Reviews-Rays_on_the_Bay-Kailua_Kona_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",restaurants,5.0,3.5

Nice little Italian restaurant,"Located at the foot of the cinema it was ideally located for a pre-cinema drink. We had hoped to return for dinner after the showing but closing at 9.00pm made it impossible. A nice little Italian restaurant with good service and a nice menu.

Typical American diner - as though time has stood still.,"Our hotel was located nearby and we stopped in for breakfast, for our son to experience a typical American diner - something a little more nostalgic than the modern restaurants.

Had a lot of fun without 'breaking the bank',"Out for a late evening with my son, we stopped by for a beer and the opportunity to play some of the table games located at on end of the bar.
