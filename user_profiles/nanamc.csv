Second visit this year!!,"We stayed here in March this year and were very pleased to return.
The purpose of our current visit is to have massages from Basheer who is a master masseuse. Basheer and his team will give you a relaxing massage if this is what you need but if you have a specific problem area, discuss this with Basheer and he will be able to treat that issue - if not he will tell you. My husband has a spinal disability and basheer's massages make a huge difference to his mobility and comfort. I had a foot massage from Vaser and this also has made a difference and has decreased my foot pain.
We always thoroughly enjoy our time at the Parkroyal Penang - the hotel is very clean and tidy, the staff are all extremely polite, helpful and courteous.
We would like to mention the reception staff members Yazim and Eita and the waiters Abid and Rizaz who all gave us extremely good service with a smile!!

Great place to stay,"We were very happy with our 6 days here. Our room was very clean, tidy and nice (except for the wardrobe door that would not stay shut in spite of being reported twice) and the beds were very comfortable with sufficient pillows and covers provided.
There are two entrances - one from the street and the other from the front court area where the old olive tree is growing.
Breakfast was included and provided ample choices for all tastes. There was very nice brewed coffee, hot water for tea and instant coffee too. The breakfast room has several tables on the balcony area so don't forget to look around.

The restaurant is upstairs in Falirou Street in a property that looks like a private home. The green sign on the front of the building says ManhManh so it could be easily missed.

Wonderful 4 days !!,"We took the 4 day Classical Greece & Meteora - First Class Tour from Athens in early October 2019 and after a short wait we were shown to our bus for the trip to begin.
First, we met Eva our Tour Guide - she is a very delightful young woman who has an extensive knowledge of Greek history and Greek Mythology, which made the tour so much more interesting. At every stop, Eva was able to expalin how the myths generally had an element of truth which pointed to an historical fact.
Our very competant driver Panos was very good and as we sat in the front of the bus we were able to observe his use of the road and his care when driving ... well done Panos!!!
During this tour, we saw many amazing places such as Epidauras, Olympia, the Sanctury of the Olympian Zeus, Delphi, Kalambaka, Meteora where we saw the amazing Byzantine Monastaries perched high on the hilltops.

Fantastic Hotel and Fantastic staff,"We travelled from South Australia and stayed here in total for 11 nights (with a 4 day Tour in between our stays).
The Hotel staff, especially Vasilis, Vasia and VIcky are extremely helpful, courteous and very professional, which makes it easy to approach them all for information and directions. The cleaning staff are very efficient and helpful too.
Our rooms were on the 6th floor and were, on both occasions, extremely clean, spacious and included an adequately equipped kitchen with hotplate, fridge, kettle and coffee maker. The shower was great with good pressure and the bed was really comfortable and had plenty of good pillows.
There is a Metro station a few minutes walk from the Hotel and the Acropolis is approx 800metres away if you care to walk there. The Metro makes it very easy to get to most archeological sites and on warm or wet days makes travel much easier.
In the nearby streets you will find many restaurants and eating houses as well as laundromats and supermarkets. Within two blocks we found 2 laundromats and 1 drycleaner so it is easy to pack light to make room for all your souveniers. The laundromat we used cost 5 Euro to wash and 2 Euro to dry per load.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definately recommend this hotel to our friends.

Great place to relax!!,"We arrived at the Parkroyal after dark and were greeted by lovely smiles and after check in, a welcome drink in the Javana lounge by the hostess Lorenz.
After moving into our room we went for a walk around the gardens and then sat and listened to the Ark Band in the Javana Lounge until we crashed for the night.
Our room was clean, tidy and very well suplied with amenities. Our balcony looked out over the garden to the sea and provided us many hours to watch the water activities enjoyed by hotel guests.
Complimentary breakfast is served in Cinnamon Asian Kitchen which is clean, tidy and well set out. You can eat inside or in the very wide undercover outdoor areas where the ceiling fans circulate the warm air. From the outdoor area the views of the garden, big tree and double swing are very pleasant.
The staff in Cinnamon are very friendly, polite and helpful, especiall Wahyu who we saw most mornings. Wayhu always greeted us with a smile, polite and funy conversation and assisted us with whatever request we had - he makes a great cappuccino too!!
We ate a few times in Cinnamon for dinner at the buffets and must say what a great range of foods from different cultures were presented for guests to choose from. One waiter Ibid, who served us, also gave us great service with a pleasant smile.
Although we are not swimmers, there are two pools in the hotel gardens, one with a water slide and one that appears more shallow for family groups to spend time with their children in a calmer way. There are always Life Guards on duty whenever people are in the pools. I must also mention the toilets downstairs for guests who use the pools, sun lounges etc ... they are the cleanest and most pleasantly fragrant toilet blocks I can remember using!
We were aware of the Massage service available and had two massages from Basheer who offers massages 3 days per week, his neice Nita and her husband provide massages on other days - I had a foot massage by Nita and thoroughly enjoyed it ... so did my feet!!
We were not happy with only one aspect of our stay here. It was White Eagle Tours. We spoke to their staff on 3 occasions trying to organise our days. We were talked out of going to George Town on one occasion and into booking their driver to take us to Entopia (The Butterfly Farm) and the Batik Factory (where we were to be picked up later) - we were told it was only 600 metres from Entopia to the Batik Factory but in actuallity it was closer to 1.4 kilometers which in the humidity and 30+c temperature was quite a walk for us given our health issues. We also wanted to go into George Town on the hotel shuttle but the White Eagle staff had not told us the shuttle had to be booked the day before and we were told we could not use the shuttle .. so we took a local taxi into George Town and the driver parked and waited for us to visit the attractions and then move on to the next place we wanted to see and drove us back to the Hotel when we were done site-seeing ... and the cost was far less than the tour through White Eagle Tours.",March 2019,PARKROYAL Penang Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635527-d306935-Reviews-PARKROYAL_Penang_Resort-Batu_Ferringhi_Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",hotels,5.0,4.0

We saw whales!!,"We took a whale watching tour with this company and were not dissapointed!! We saw a family of Orcas, many seals and a Bald Eagle.

Personal handwritten welcome in your room!,"We stayed in this lovely hotel for 3 nights in September 2018. I was delighted to find a hand written note from the General Manager in our room when we arrived. Such a lovely touch!
The St. Regis is well situated close to the Pacific Centre, City Centre Station and in walking distance to Chinatown and Gas Town. We also walked to the Vancouver Lookout which is well worth the effort, the panoramic views are quite amazing.
There were three menu choices for breakfast which is served at your table by the helpful Breakfast Room staff.
I must mention the wonderful front desk staff who were so helpful when we wanted to book a whale watchng tour - so very helpful.
I would definately recommend this Hotel to friends and family travelling to Vacouver.

Great night's stay on our way to Heathrow,"We arrived late in the afternoon and the room was ready, clean and tidy. There was a kettle with good sized mugs, tea, coffee and milk provided - bonus!!

Second visit this year - still excellent!,"We returned to the Dolphin Bay Suites in September after a delightful stay in May. We returned to the north of Scotland to attend the Highland Military Tattoo at Fort George and to visit more intersting places.
Our unit was again, spotlessly clean when we arrived and when the microwave stopped working, it was replaced within 20 minutes with a new one.

Beautiful old home and fantastic surrounds!,"We stayed here for 3 nights on our way to Scotland. The Hotel is a beautiful old country house built around 1911 and is set on 20 acres of landscaped gardens and forests that reach to the shore of Lake Windermere. Make sure you walk around the garden and then down the path to the boat house on the lake shore - the walk and view are really worth doing and the garden's flowers are beautiful.
The house has plenty of lounge areas which are lovely to relax in and read a paper or sip a cup of tea. Some of the rooms are on the small side but the ample lounge areas downstairs make up for the lack of lounging space in the rooms.
We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to our friends.",September 2017,Cragwood Country House Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186330-d584327-Reviews-Cragwood_Country_House_Hotel-Windermere_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Windermere, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,5.0

Beautiful old house and grounds,"We visited Duff House in September and enjoyed our 90 mins wandering about. We chatted to the guides who were stationed around the house and gave lots of useful information and directions. As Australians we were directed to the two old globes(1700-1800) with one showing the lack of the southern coast of Australia as the globes pre-date the completed mapping of Australia - we really appreciated the guide's time in pointing this out to us. The decorations, furniture and paintings are well worth the time to spend there looking at the many rooms and gaining a smalll glimpse of life in Victorian times.",September 2017,Duff House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186488-d566294-Reviews-Duff_House-Banff_Aberdeenshire_Scotland.html,"Banff, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fort George and the Highland Military Tattoo,"We visited #FortGeorge again to watch the #HighlandMilitaryTattoo which we thoroughly enjoyed in spite of the chill wind that blew almost all night - but - it did not rain. :)
The military re-enactments, the music, colour and pagentry were well worth the time and energy to get there.
Personally I enjoyed the 'stroll through history' the enactments played out, from the jacobites to the modern day - very well done.",September 2017,Fort George,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186543-d523427-Reviews-Fort_George-Inverness_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Inverness, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5

"Excellent tour, vehicle and guide!","We accompanied friends on this tour and could not have wished it to be any better. David Hamilton (driver) has very broad knowledge of Orkney and it's attractions. He was very informative and took time to answer all our questions. The tour moved along well but was not rushed and he had us back at the ship right on time as arranged.

Wonderful example of a Z plan tower house,"We visited Brodie Castle this September and took a guided tour - non guided tours are available on some days.
The tour commenced in the amazing library and just got better from there. The history hidden in this castle is amazing and the guides share the growth of the castle as each Laird made their own additions. The castle has four floors with the nursery on the top floor with the nanny's rooms. The personal articles that were used by the previous residents are like peeping into history as you see the things from childrens toys, books, the mirrors, porcelain pots/vases to the kitchen equipment on display.
The number of art works in the house is exceptional thanks to the wives of the lairds who were wise enough to gather artwork.
My only complaint is that photography is not allowed but a Brodie Castle book is available for five pounds.",September 2017,Brodie Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551767-d2188358-Reviews-Brodie_Castle-Forres_Moray_Scotland.html,"Forres, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
