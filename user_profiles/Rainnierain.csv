Perfect,"I love munnork island. This is a perfect vacation. Clear sea and nice beach, best place to relax and not too far from Bangkok. Food was great especially the fresh coconut juice. The little hut by tge beach is so fantastic we can lay down there all day to see the perfect view. The view above and under the sea is too good to be true.
