Bewitched and satisfied,"Undoubtedly one of the best cafes’ I’ve been to! Tables outside and inside. The prices are quite low. I recommend the schwarzwald cake, it isn’t too sweet, too small or too-whatever ;), croissants are also perfect. Latte macchiato is tasty, very subtle and I wasn’t disappointed with the green tea - to be honest, I hadn’t drunk a better green tea before! I think that there is much more tasty food to try there :DD I liked the atmosphere, the decorations and the view of the street.",August 2020,Kolben Kaffee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187281-d6779628-Reviews-Kolben_Kaffee-Freiburg_im_Breisgau_Baden_Wurttemberg.html,"Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Must-be!,"„Flam’s” is placed in a lovely aisle in the old part of the city. It has tables both outside and inside. The prices are fair (6€40 for a flamkuchen and about 3€ for a drink). The food is amazing, not too salty and not too bland. And the atmosphere is hard to be replaced :D The stuff is friendly, you can order in English.",July 2020,Flam's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g666494-d3681989-Reviews-Flam_s-Vendenheim_Strasbourg_Bas_Rhin_Grand_Est.html,"Vendenheim, France",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Great experience,A very interesting museum. It was fantastic to see the original music sheets and to listen to Bach’s pieces played on the old instruments.
