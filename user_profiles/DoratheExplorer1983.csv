Unfriendly staff,"We stayed 3nights here. The location was good as central and near metro. The receptionist on arrival was grumpy. There is a buffet for breakfast which had a large selection of food and drinks. There is also a cafeteria which serves Tapas and evening meals but watch out if you only want a drink after 6pm even with the place over half empty you can’t sit at a table to drink it. We went in for a meal our last night at 7pm and was told only tapas even though others were looking at menus as they don’t serve until 8.30 and the restaurant didn’t open until 9pm. First morning at breakfast it was drop this and that by one member of staff, very noisy. You got the feeling you were not wanted. What they need to remember is no customers no job. Be a bit more friendly and we may come back.",September 2018,Silken Indautxu Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187454-d228618-Reviews-Silken_Indautxu_Hotel-Bilbao_Province_of_Vizcaya_Basque_Country.html,"Bilbao, Spain",hotels,2.0,4.0
Internal Tour,On the morning of September 30th we did the morning tour of inside the theatre which was fascinating! The tour guide was very informative and let us take as many photos as we liked .

The visit that wasn’t beware !,"After paying our entrance fee got to the entrance and were stopped from entry as our backpack was too large. They had an airport style measure of bag and as ours was to tall though it was half empty were told it had to be placed in the cloakroom. With no other way other than our hands to carry phones, purses, and camera’s we refused to leave it there. No signs mention this size issue at the pay desk. We got our money back so we’re ready using a different bag when visiting the maritime museum but they didn’t have any size issues.",September 2018,Guggenheim Museum Bilbao,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187454-d190276-Reviews-Guggenheim_Museum_Bilbao-Bilbao_Province_of_Vizcaya_Basque_Country.html,"Bilbao, Spain",attractions,1.0,4.5
Interesting Maritime,On arrival at the desk the lady assistant was most helpful and with very good English not something we had come across up to now. She explained how to go round the museum without having to pay extra for the information guide. Even though it was a Saturday was very quiet inside and we enjoyed the time there very much so. The only downside was finding the place. Look for the RED crane and when looking over the water to the dry dock you are possibly standing on the roof of the museum.,September 2018,Museo Maritimo Ria de Bilbao,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187454-d2160538-Reviews-Museo_Maritimo_Ria_de_Bilbao-Bilbao_Province_of_Vizcaya_Basque_Country.html,"Bilbao, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.0

Not what I Expected,"After reading a review from Lonely Planet about how good the food was we were very disappointed with not only the food but the service was absolutely shocking ! We had the lunch time Special which was only €12 but this was the only thing they offered lunch times . I had cauliflower cheese to start with and tuna lasagna for the main course . The tuna had what looked to have been reheated in the microwave . My mum had a chicken salad and before she had finished she was asked if she was ready for the main course! The oils which were placed on the table before our starters arrived were taken suddenly whilst stilling using them for the salad!

Food was served luke warm , which was warmer than the staffs attitude! Will definitely not be returning again !",September 2018,El Txoko Berria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187454-d3294181-Reviews-El_Txoko_Berria-Bilbao_Province_of_Vizcaya_Basque_Country.html,"Bilbao, Spain",restaurants,1.0,3.5
