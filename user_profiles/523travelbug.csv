Graet Thai fun,"Take one of these great ""taxis"", they are so much fun, cost around 200 Baht or $4 oz dollars for our family of four, from our hotel far end of Patong to Joycelong shopping centre. Take it whenever you can Haggle for price, take it at night, they are lit up like a nightclub open air and a sound system simply amazing not to mention banging music, it feels like a party bus and they are quick and easy......great fun.",May 2017,Tuk-Tuk Drivers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1215781-d8538453-Reviews-Tuk_Tuk_Drivers-Phuket_Town_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",attractions,5.0,3.5
Beautiful and Easy,"Travelled to James Bond island then made our way to a beautiful spot on the bay, where we were met by canoes and this is the best part, you dont paddle they do it for you, through beautiful caves with limestone and turqouise water, looks like a scene out of King Kong, beautiful and picturesque, highly reccommend.
Great for everyone, couples families friends etc.
