Worth the visit,"Clearly the most obvious place for a tourist to visit in Athens. This is worth a visit but will be extremely popular and can be very cold during the mid-summer months. Not too expensive to see such an impressive place, this is an obvious place to visit for anyone visiting Athens.",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Definitely worth the evening,Sophia was a terrific instructor who kept us entertained during the class and shared her stories while also asking us for our stories over dinner. We created 7 dishes that can be used for a single large dinner or as individual starters or desserts whenever to compliment any meal. She showed her native Greek knowledge of cooking the dishes and made the class very friendly to beginner or expert chefs. This class is absolutely worth an evening of your trip!,January 2020,Athens Cooking Day Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d3602683-Reviews-Athens_Cooking_Day_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
