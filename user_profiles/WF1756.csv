Full of interest,"Greenwich Observatory is best approached from the water (you can take a boat from near Tower Bridge). To anyone with a passing interest in time, history, navigation or invention, Greenwich Observatory is a star attraction. Not only can you stand on the prime meridian, you can also take the very interesting and detailed audio tour of the history of longitude. The hill also commands an excellent view of London. There are a number of other attractions nearby, so allow plenty to time to look around.",September 2019,Royal Observatory Greenwich,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d194293-Reviews-Royal_Observatory_Greenwich-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0

Much more than we expected,"We have stayed at a Sheraton Four Points in North America but nothing could have prepared us for the quality of the one in Dubai. We arrived at the hotel before 7 in the morning after flying in from Athens and, for a modest fee, we could check in straight away. This was very helpful.
The suite, on one of the high floors, consisted of two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a sitting room and dinning room and a full kitchen, not to mention a washing machine and dryer. It was just outstanding.
The hotel has a rooftop swimming pool and a bar with excellent views, especially at night.

Good room and great location,"Our stay at the Hotel Plaza L’Etolie on Av de Wagram was a pleasant one. The hotel is very close to the Arc de Triomphe and our room had a view of the Eiffel Tower, a bonus which enhanced our stay. There were also a number of restaurants in our immediate vicinity which was also advantage.

The hotel is compact, especially the corridors and the lift is tiny, barely fitting the four of us. There are some quirky old fashioned features. The room key, for example, is an actual key and they like you to leave it with the front desk when you go out. The staff are also very helpful.

The room was spacious enough for us. Our bed was comfortable and we slept well and there was a sofa bed for the two children. It is worth noting that the website does not confirm that there can be four in a room but we found that the sofa bed was fine for the purpose.

The location, the comfort of the room and the friendliness of the staff made for a very pleasant stay.",September 2019,Hotel Plaza Etoile,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d228758-Reviews-Hotel_Plaza_Etoile-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,4.0,4.0
Great for the fans,"You need to book Harry Potter World well in advance of your intended visit. When I booked for us more than a month in advance of our trip, I couldn’t get a morning booking any day of the week we were in London.
Getting to the studio requires taking a train to Watford Junction (we went from Euston) and then a shuttle bus from the station. You need to have cash for the shuttle as they don’t take card.
The tour is for the fans. Detailed sets have been recreated, including the great hall, Daigon Alley and the station platform at Paddington. On the trip you get the chance to ‘ride’ a broom in house robes and buy butterbeer!
The high points for us were the scale model of Hogwarts and the extensive and recently opened Gringott’s Bank, including some impressive visuals of its destruction.

An exceptional experience,"The Acropolis is, deservedly, a top drawer experience. The centerpiece of the Acropolis is the Parthenon which you can get close to but not walk through. The complex itself dominates the city and, from the city square, it looks an impossible walk to the top. Fortunately, there is a track which winds around the hill and allows you to get to the top. From the north, though, it is not well signed so it’s a matter of following the crowds to get to the top.
We went there in the afternoon and were able to enter straight away.

An outstanding series of exhibits,"The Acropolis Museum is a stand out attraction. The building itself is modern and elegant and beautifully situated. From the top floor there is an excellent view of the Acropolis itself.
There is an extensive collection throughout the museum but the centerpiece is probably the Parthenon Galley with its careful recreation of the Parthenon frieze, complete with reminders that important parts of the Parthenon are in other museums.

This is a must do when in Paris,"The Arc de Triomphe is constructed on a truly grand scale and you get a commanding view down broad, impressive streets. You can also go up to the top for a view of the Paris skyline.
Ensure that you take the tunnels to the Arc itself and not just view it from the surrounding footpaths.

A Five Star Experience,"The Palace of Versailles is an absolute must see on a trip to Paris. The Palace itself is ornate, grand, richly decorated and historically significant. The gardens are also extensive, with the various pools on a grand scale, so you need at least three hours to even begin to do justice to the Palace and the gardens.

The Palace is easily accessed via the Metro, although it takes some planning because the Metro is vast and complex. Nevertheless, we didn’t let that put us off. There are, too, a number of different tickets on offer. My advice is to ensure you have a timed entry one which allows you to skip the line. When we went the line must have been 300-400 meters long. Make sure, too, that you include the gardens in your ticket because they are a vital part of the experience. Be prepared to do lots of walking. Keep in mind that if you do have issues walking there are carts to hire.",September 2019,Palace of Versailles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187148-d188681-Reviews-Palace_of_Versailles-Versailles_Yvelines_Ile_de_France.html,"Versailles, France",attractions,5.0,4.0
An Outstanding Experience,"The Tower of London is a genuine five star site, especially if you are the slightest bit interested in history. We arrived at opening time where we picked up our on-line tickets. Although getting in was a bit slow, the Tower precinct is big enough for the crowds to be spread out.
There is much to see as sections of the Tower were constructed at different times. The Medieval Palace, the White Tower and the battlements and even the ravens are all fascinating while the Crown Jewels display is not only interesting, the flow of people is well managed. The family consensus was that the display about the death of the Princes during the Wars of the Roses was the highlight of that part of the history which dealt with imprisonment, torture and executions.
The Tower is not to be missed.",September 2019,Tower of London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187547-Reviews-Tower_of_London-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5

Good food but some odd quirks,"When we sat down to eat at Monsieur Madame we ordered our food to be told that there would be wait as the kitchen didn’t open until 7.00. Although that meant a half hour wait we had walked so much during the day we didn’t care.
The main courses, when they arrived were delicious and between us we had chicken, salmon and lamb shoulder. They were all so delicious we decided to order desert. Imagine our surprise to find that, of the four deserts we wanted, only two were available. Given we were the first diners of the night we found that strange.
Nevertheless, what we did eat was delicious and the service was good.",September 2019,Monsieur Madame,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d15297203-Reviews-Monsieur_Madame-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,4.0,3.5

Adventures at the London Metropole!,"There are some great features about this hotel. It's in a great location, with two Underground Stations in close proximity and a short walk down to Marble Arch and some good shopping. The lobby is spacious and the restaurant is good - we had both breakfast and one dinner there and had no complaints.
However, the hotel is a bit tired and could do with a design update. I would, for instance, hate to have mobility issues getting into the bath in order to have a shower. And what is it with hotels and their swimming pools? The one here was out of action. I really think that there should be some sort of notification or little sweetener when this happens as it seems to happen far too often.
We had a number of issues with our room and ended up having to move twice!
Despite this, I have to commend the very friendly staff who cheerfully resolved our issues so that, on balance, we had a good stay.",September 2019,Hilton London Metropole,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193089-Reviews-Hilton_London_Metropole-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,3.5

Probably my favourite hotel,"We have stayed at the Hotel Bonaventure twice and loved it both times. It is unusual in that the hotel is upstairs on the top floor and the design sees a collection of mezzanine floors. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The hotel is in an excellent location across the road from the central railway station and it is linked to the underground city. A feature of the hotel is the pool which is brilliant in summer and equally enticing in winter with snow on the pool deck. Make sure, whatever the season, you use the pool. We found the service excellent. After a mix up resulted in us being offered breakfast on our last morning, we arrived at the dinning room only to find that breakfast wouldn't begin for another half hour.

There are some nice rides like Nemo and friends for the younger kids and Mission Space for the slightly more adventurous. We also love the gentle and history laded Spaceship Earth.
At the World Showcase section of the park you will find the best food and best variety in all of the Disney resorts. The Coral Sea Restaurant, Le Cellier, Chefs de France all offer excellent food while the Biergarten and Princess Storybook offer buffets with entertainment.

An efficient way to cross the border using the bus,Using The tunnel bus to cross the border is a good way to move between Detroit and Windsor. Of course you have to deal with the security officers on either side of the tunnel but that has been a fairly speedy experience. When catching the bus back to Windsor avoid the Rosa Parks Terminal. There are other stops you can use.,December 2017,Detroit-Windsor Tunnel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g42139-d560601-Reviews-Detroit_Windsor_Tunnel-Detroit_Michigan.html,"Detroit, Michigan",attractions,4.0,4.0

A great tour for the family,The Ford factory tour was well worth it. We got historical and modern perspectives from two films and then saw the factory where the F-150 is made. All of us learnt a lot from what was an enjoyable experience. We did this as part of the Museum experience.

A top class attraction,"The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation is a great museum with some different and unique experiences. When we went we also had the benefit of the Pixar display which had an abundance of hands - on activities for all of the family. The rest of the museum has some extraordinary machines; not just cars but farm equipment, planes and railway engines as well. An unexpected highlight was the Rosa Parks bus, make sure you don't miss it.",December 2017,The Henry Ford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g42130-d103793-Reviews-The_Henry_Ford-Dearborn_Michigan.html,"Dearborn, Michigan",attractions,5.0,5.0
A good choice near the Airport,"After flying in from Auckland to Houston, we needed to break our journey and stay overnight near the airport for an early flight the next day. The hotel was perfectly suited to our needs with a comfortable room. We picked this hotel not just for its proximity to the airport but also because it had a restaurant and a free shuttle. The restaurant seemed more like a boozy bar at first which was a bit disconcerting as I was travelling with my two daughters. However, the food was surprisingly tasty and the service sound. The shuttle provided a good service for a very early flight.",December 2017,Sheraton North Houston at George Bush Intercontinental,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g56003-d99101-Reviews-Sheraton_North_Houston_at_George_Bush_Intercontinental-Houston_Texas.html,"Houston, Texas",hotels,4.0,3.5
"Great, reliable food","We recently had an anniversary dinner at the Keg in Windsor.

A great meal out,"For our last night in Canberra we ate at Black Fire and the meat based meal was a delight. I had the lamb, my wife had the steak, as did our younger daughter, while the older one had the ribs. The meal was perfect and the service was helpful, with our waitress suggesting the desert sharing plate. This proved to be an inspired choice for the family. This was easily the best meal we had in Canberra.",September 2017,Black Fire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255057-d6882195-Reviews-Black_Fire-Canberra_Australian_Capital_Territory.html,"Canberra, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"A rich, immersive experience","The Australian War Memorial is a multi-faceted, serious educational experience. It is full of solemnity and, sometimes, pageantry. The tomb of the unknown soldier evokes the sadness of war, while the displays below ground are so extensive they require most of the day to do them all. All of the Australian conflicts are covered. I particularly recommend searching for relatives on the honour roll (you can use the website to find out which panel the name appears) and the VC awardees section as especially worthwhile.",September 2017,Australian War Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255057-d257269-Reviews-Australian_War_Memorial-Canberra_Australian_Capital_Territory.html,"Canberra, Australia",attractions,5.0,5.0
