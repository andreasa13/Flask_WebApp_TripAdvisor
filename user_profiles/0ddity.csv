"Not enough can be said about how great this place is, and it's all true. Must see while in Athens","The Acropolis is a must see if you're in Athens. It's grand and magestic and absolutely impressive. I do recommend reading up ahead of time so you'd know what you're witnessing, or take a guided tour. Walking around ruins without context and unprepared lessens the experience. It might be a good idea to visit the the museum before going up if you plan on doing this without a guide. The place is always packed full of tourists and there's a line, but the wait is reasonable. If you want to avoid the lines it would be a good idea going up at the end of the day. But check open in hours before deciding as none of the sites work late afternoon.
I recommend getting the ""all pass"" ticket, as most other sites are very close by and worth visiting.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Quaint and picturesque neighborhood, well worth the stroll. Many photo opportunities","This is a beautiful, old city neighborhood on the slopes of the Acropolis, and in fact leads to it, so it would make a great starter walk before going up there. It's filled with really, really narrow pathways and houses in the traditional white and blue as well as many murals and graffiti. There are many great views of Athens from it. It's quite the climb, but well worth it.",October 2019,Anafiotika,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d524609-Reviews-Anafiotika-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Hours of viewing! Not to miss if you're visiting the Acropolis,"This new museum iw wonderful, but note that the ""all pass"" ticket does not include the museum. It does include other museums but not this one. It's busy all year round and there's always a line at the entrance, but it's not that bad. Also, keep in mind the last admission to the museum is at 15:00, so it's recommended to get an earlier start when planing a visit.
The museum carries wonderful exhibits and detailed explanations on each and at the top level a to scale reconstruction of the Parthenon with all the parts that are not kept on site. Pretty impressive.",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Edgy neighborhood, flea market, dive bars, graffiti all a step from the Acropolis","This is an edgier, colorful neighborhood at the center of which is the is the Monasteraki train station and square. During the day there's a market outside and at night it's a meeting place for young people. Around it are small pedestrian alleys with souvenir shops and flea market. You can also find many tiny streets filled with great graffiti and some more questionable characters, so watch out for you bag and wallets in there. At night the place is buzzing with people and there are lots of bars where young people come to party.",October 2019,Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d265865-Reviews-Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Best panoramic view of Athens! Steep climb but worth it.,"Mount Lycabettus, or the ""wolf hill"" is part of the 7 hills of Athens. Most of the mountain is a charming and somewhat upscale neighborhood with steep, winding streets and staircases overflowing with vegitation and trees. Great to stroll on a hot day as it's shady,but the climb could be tiring. Near the top there's a cable car which takes you to the peak and there you can enjoy an unmatched 360 view of Athens and a great view of the Acropolis.
The cable car has very limited operation hours, mainly till noon and also runs every 30 min, so keep in mind to check the time table and opening hours, so you won't be stuck waiting to go up. There's also a restaurant on top of the hill, but i wouldn't recommend eating there as it's mainly a tourist trap.",October 2019,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Old school bakery with great traditional Greek pastry,"This is a small unassuming bakery, very close to Sintagma square with a great selection of traditional Greek pastries. It looks and is prepared old school and tastes fantastic. Especially recommended is the ""bougatsa"" - a filo and milk cream pastry, considered to be a typical on the go breakfast. You should also try the various ""pita"" - savory filo pasties",October 2019,Ariston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1025168-Reviews-Ariston-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"A lively, quaint neighborhood which offers hours of strolling","Plaka is situated in the very center of Athens, below the acropolis. It consists of a labyrinth of tiny alleys, streets and pedestrian zones. It's filled with typical European style 19th/early 20th century architecture, shops which varry from international, posh chains, to alleys filled with souvenirs.
Each alley offers something new: trendy bars, edgy dive bars and clubs, street food and many restaurants.
It's a neighborhood worth revisiting several days from a different route and at different hours of the day, if your hotel is very close to the center, since it'll give you a better chance to see the variety it has to offer variety it has offer.",October 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
