Fun in the sun,This was a great trip! The boat was beautiful and there was ample time for swimming as well as exploring on Capri. Alex was an excellent guide and provided insightful commentary and insight while making sure everyone was happy and safe.,June 2019,Capri Boat Experience - Small Group Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187785-d14054422-Capri_Boat_Experience_Small_Group_Tour-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",activities,5.0,4.5
Greek History,"For anyone interested in history, art, architecture and mythology the Acropolis is a must see! The Acropolis offers you a histic view of Greece and the ancient world as well as a phenominal view of the city of Athens. Although the Acropolis is on a hill overlooking Athens it is easy to navigate and teh paths are well graded and maintained. I'm glad I went during a cooler period as there is not much shade at the top!",March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Exceptionally relaxing!,I had such a fabulous experience at the Athens Fish Spa! The spa itself is lovely with great atmosphere and it smells wonderful. The therapist I has was phenominal. I did the 4 hour spa package and the therapist was expert with all the different treatments. I would highly reccomend this spa and all of the services they offer!,March 2019,Athens Fish Spa Massage & Hammam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2099485-Reviews-Athens_Fish_Spa_Massage_Hammam-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Good Products,"The spa is in a strange location and a bit hard to find. The products used and available are excellent, but the service rooms and environment are not the best. If you are looking for a spa atmosphere this is not the place. The radio is a bit loud and set to a top 40 station. I had brow and lash services and the room I was in was not private and many therapists came in and out of the room banging drawers open and closed, riffling through products, etc. Additionally another client and therapist entered the room for treatment during my treatment. Both my therapist and the therapist of the client took multiple phone calls during treatment. I am happy with the services provided, but would pass on another visit and find somewhere that has a better spa atmosphere.",March 2019,Mf Day Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d8558063-Reviews-Mf_Day_Spa-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,5.0
Perfect Holiday,"Alion Beach Hotel was a perfect place to spend Christmas as a solo traveler. The location is amazing, the rooms spacious with beautiful views and the staff was above and beyond attentive! And the food! The food is wonderful, plentiful and affordable. I spent most of one day in the spa relaxing and being pampered by amazing spa staff. I highly recommend!",December 2018,Alion Beach Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g262055-d278158-Reviews-Alion_Beach_Hotel-Ayia_Napa_Famagusta_District.html,"Ayia Napa, Cyprus",hotels,5.0,4.5
