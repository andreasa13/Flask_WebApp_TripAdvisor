NOT CHILD FRIENDLY,This restaurant is nor child friendly or ogre friendly the art is nice but children get very bored as stuff is all pretty much the same. I only suggest going if you are a super-fan of Greek art.,October 2019,Benaki Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198714-Reviews-Benaki_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Great Hotel Bad Area,"I have 0 problems with this hotel the staff are very nice and the rooms are lovely. But the thing ghat lets this great hotel down is the area, we found walking back at night time quite disturbing and lots of rubbish everywhere. Also very noisy.",October 2019,Athens Comfort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d12549457-Reviews-Athens_Comfort-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Another quality thing in Athens!,This was truly a fabulous experience the whole site is amazing and amazes me every time I see it you can't come to Athens and not go up this historic mountain.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
MUST SEE!!!!!!!,"You have to come here, the architecture of the building is delicious and the underground ancient town is superb. Amazing hidden library/reading area and lovely art. Shop was also very nice, toilets here nice and clean so overall probably the best museum I've been to as an ogre.",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Amazingly Brilliant,"We went to see a Benfica vs Anderlecht friendly on our summer holiday and though Benfica lost the stadium is a fantastic sight and Benfica have a pet eagle that at the start of each game fly's around the inside of the stadium. The whole experience was amazing and the highlight was watching that eagle fly around with the fans clapping along and then finally the eagle lands in the centre for all to see. The stadium is the best football (soccer) stadium I have ever seen, this stadium is definitely worth a visit.",July 2019,Estadio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d3877563-Reviews-Estadio_do_Sport_Lisboa_e_Benfica-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
Disappointed,"We had very high hopes going in to the museum having enjoyed the first few books but I was disappointed as the shop is extremely expensive and the museum is cool in some parts but also a bit boring in others. The wax models on the top floor were good but the worker who was touring our group spoke like "" this is were Sherlock would sit in the evening"" and that sometimes they forgot that he is fictional. Overall the experience was slightly on the boring side and I definitely don't recommend bringing small children.",April 2019,Sherlock Holmes Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d211907-Reviews-Sherlock_Holmes_Museum-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,3.5
Very Poor,Ryanair is below average as their is no on-board entertainment and the seats are worse than uncomfartable to sit on. This airline is very bad but most of the time it is the cheapest option so if you want an airplane that is simple and reliable this airline could work but it might not be enjoyable as other bigger airlines.,October 2018,Ryanair,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729141-Reviews-Ryanair,World,flights,2.0,3.0
Average,"EasyJet airlines are always standard, the seats are not very comfy, the Captain was friendly as the crew were too. The toilets are tiny as always, I really don't like planes.",June 2019,easyJet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729066-Reviews-EasyJet,World,flights,3.0,3.5
RECLINING SEATS!!!!,"The main attraction of this cinema is that recently they upgraded to ODEON LUXE which has very comfy reclining seats with a handy table. As all ways at cinemas the pic and mix and pretty much all food is very expensive, other than that the cinema is very good.",June 2019,Odeon Cinema Glasgow Quay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186534-d4105895-Reviews-Odeon_Cinema_Glasgow_Quay-Glasgow_Scotland.html,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
WWE Live,"Great location and capacity, went to see WWE Live in November 2018 and had a great time! The WWE shop is highly expensive but worth it as I still love to wear my tour t-shirt that I got for Â£25. One of the greatest nights of my life in an amazing venue.",November 2018,The SSE Hydro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186534-d4986333-Reviews-The_SSE_Hydro-Glasgow_Scotland.html,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
Busy But Spectacular,"We didn't get a tour so we had to walk round and see it ourselves, the entire place is jammed with tourists and people trying to get you to come on tours. When you get inside is really amazing and inspiring, the architecture is beyond beautiful. Fantastic experience and definitely worth going.",October 2018,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
Fantastic,"Very big park with great play park next to a house of an art lover, fantastic astro turf football pitch, good dry ski slope, nice gardens and great cycle track.
I Love everything in the park and go there lots great place to walk a dog or enjoy the view!",June 2019,Bellahouston Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186534-d189012-Reviews-Bellahouston_Park-Glasgow_Scotland.html,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
Very Good Cafe but not perfect,"The cafe is very trendy and the staff are friendly, the toilets are alright but there are only to cubicles. The only big problem I had is
that my glass which came with my chocolate milk was beyond dirty, it had blemishes and things I can't describe all over it, I had to drink my chocolate milk out of the bottle.",July 2019,Estefanea Cafe (Sintra),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189164-d8075122-Reviews-Estefanea_Cafe_Sintra-Sintra_Sintra_Municipality_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Sintra, Portugal",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Windy,"Camp site is in a nice location with a decent pool, I stayed with eurocamp and it was good except one room had toilet and another had shower and sink so after you finished doing your ""business"" you have to walk across the kitchen to wash your hands. Eurocamp site rep is very very friendly and gives you great tips, the problems are the wi-fi is terrible most of the time and it is extremely windy.The restaurant on site is completely rubbish and the supermarket is tiny, there are not many good restaurants or supermarkets nearby so eating is sometimes hard. Games room is small and have to pay for everything inside and when I went they had a tennis court but no rackets or tennis balls!",July 2019,Orbitur Guincho,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189154-d239341-Reviews-Orbitur_Guincho-Cascais_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Cascais, Portugal",hotels,3.0,3.0
Very Good,"I go to this stadium nearly every week sometimes more, most of the fans are fair minded people but some are not. The atmosphere is outstanding for a small stadium and the shop is very good too. The workers in the shop work very hard and have to put up with some pretty crazy people. I love rugby park and I highly recommend a visit to this historic stadium!
Finally there is little leg room in the seats.",May 2019,Rugby Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186520-d15053202-Reviews-Rugby_Park-Kilmarnock_East_Ayrshire_Ayrshire_Scotland.html,"Kilmarnock, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Mehhhhhh,"It is a standard beach. There is nice sand and a fun play park but otherwise just a normal beach. It is sometimes sunny and it is good when it is but when it is cloudy or rainy or both it is deserted and no atmosphere, nice place, okay beach.",August 2018,Troon Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551834-d6974145-Reviews-Troon_Beach-Troon_South_Ayrshire_Ayrshire_Scotland.html,"Troon, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5
Brilliant,"The monument is fantastic to look at is massive in size but the main attraction of this monument is that you can climb all the way to the top. There are to ways to get up to the top you can either use the lift or climb all the stairs up, I used the stairs and yes there were lots and lots but I enjoyed it lots. At the top there are beautiful views of Belem and the Tower, I felt I could have stayed there all day as I never got bored of staring across Belem and simply enjoying the view.",July 2019,Padrao dos Descobrimentos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d243620-Reviews-Padrao_dos_Descobrimentos-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.0
Lovely Custard Tarts!,"The park is very nice and you get a spectacular view of the Pantheon the little restaurant serves good food for good prices and the staff are very nice and friendly.

Worth it,"The park is a decent size, there are two main parks one with better grown up rides like in Toy Story Land the other one has the main Disney castle and more rides for younger children like in adventure land or discovery land. I would definitely recommend going to both parks but personally I spent 90% of my time in the studios park ( grown up one ) as I only really took a picture of the castle and main street etc. in the other park because I wanted to go on the fun big rides and their at the studios park. I highly recommend going because after hours of queuing I had a fantastic time.",June 2019,DisneylandÂ® Paris 1-Day Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187147-d11988977-DisneylandR_Paris_1_Day_Ticket-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",activities,4.0,3.5
