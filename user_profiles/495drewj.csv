Don’t look for a smoke house or a welcome,"Don’t come looking for a Smokehouse. On arrival, I excitedly answered the server (Maria as it happened) that we were here for the smoked fish. Without hesitation, she answered, “we haven’t had smoked fish for five years.” Disappointed, we finished our beer and left for an apolitical establishment.",April 2021,Maria's Smokehouse and Seafood Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34231-d402062-Reviews-Maria_s_Smokehouse_and_Seafood_Restaurant-Fort_Myers_Beach_Florida.html,"Fort Myers Beach, Florida",restaurants,1.0,3.5
Really just Ok. A bit of a disappointment.,The train ride was interesting but a bit short and expensive. The locomotive is admittedly beautifully restored. The house tour is cursory and really underwhelming compared to any historic house I’ve experienced. The sugar plantations along the river road in Louisiana come to mind as much more thorough and informative. The tasting was inadequate compared to either Foursquare or Mt. Gay. The saving grace was the movie which was really first rate.,February 2020,St. Nicholas Abbey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1183146-d154047-Reviews-St_Nicholas_Abbey-Saint_Peter_Parish_Barbados.html,Barbados,attractions,3.0,4.5
Great stop,Really nice lunch stop. Everything was great prepared fresh.

Think of it as a food tour,"We went for the lunch buffet. I had heard that it was expensive and maybe is for lunch, but you pay way more for a food tour and you wouldn’t get the variety or the quality.

Best fish cutter,Many of the reviews say this is the best place for flying fish cutter. He was serving marlin on the day I went. It was still the best fish sandwich I had on the island.

Great place for breakfast,They get busy at about 10 but you can pick a table by the sand earlier.

"Stunning, a vision of paradise.","Truly a spot that will stay with you. Unfortunately, I don’t think a picture can capture it.

"No need to go in the cave, the view from the cliff is nice.","Really I thought the cave tour was a ripoff and dangerous to boot. $15 US for 10 minutes of struggling not to kill yourself on slippery, wet cave floor that has been polished by decades of feet. You see one pool with a few inch to inch and a half sea anemones and then, if you want, 10 minutes to swim in a pool about the size of a modest hotel pool. Really a let down. Maybe it appeals to folks who have never seen a cave.",March 2020,Animal Flower Cave,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1183170-d149914-Reviews-Animal_Flower_Cave-Saint_Lucy_Parish_Barbados.html,Barbados,attractions,1.0,4.5
Just another review saying you need to go,"You do need to go. If your shy of crowds, I am, go early say around 5pm or a little after. Food will taste just as good.

"Good food, reasonable prices, great spot","I didn’t realize that all the food is buffet style but their marlin, cheesy breadfruit, rice and beans were pretty great.

"Very nice afternoon, great amenities, more so than anywhere else on Hydra","We have stayed twice in the area toward Kamini so this was our first trip to the Beach Club. It was a pleasant walk though several kilometers. The beach club sand beds are 10 euros but are cushioned and come with complimentary water on ice, a really nice towel, and your own button to call for service. That is the real key - drinks, wine, beer, milkshakes, ice cream, snacks, sushi, and sandwiches at the push of a button. What luxury! The beach has been sanded but is still a bit rocky. However there is enough sand that it can be enjoyed without sand shoes which is unique for Hydra.",September 2019,Mandraki Resort Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189493-d198958-Reviews-Mandraki_Resort_Beach-Hydra_Saronic_Gulf_Islands_Attica.html,"Hydra, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
You don’t need a tour!,"In this situation, I don’t advise a tour. A tour doesn’t help with the walk, lines or crowds. Go to the temple of Hephaestus first. Buy a ticket there. The temple is pretty wonderful and the lines are shorter. The walk to the Acropolis is easy from there particular compared to the walk up the hill. That is the only way up, but it is doable, just take it easy if needed. You will find no shade on top so dress appropriately. Some stones have been worn smooth and slippery; wear grippy shoes. There is lots of resource info on the Acropolis. Check it out before you go. I recommend the “Hidden Cities - Athens” series on PBS for a start.",September 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Don’t miss this Tour!!,This is your chance to experience the spirit of modern Athens. We met several fellow tourists who “didn’t like Athens”. We were astonished. I think this tour is the reason.

The two ends of this hotel are very different.,"It might be a little worrying (it was for me) when you see the lobby of A for Athens. It is not up to premium standard. I assure you the other end of the hotel, the roof top bar, fully is. In between, the rooms are very clean modern and comfortable. Great linens. Great amenities. Unbeatable location. You’ll enjoy the stay particularly if you get a reservation for drinks and sunset on the roof.

"Don’t hesitate, go!","We visited on a reccomendation and I was surprised, later, to see any modest, much less negative reviews. This is probably the best Indian restaurant I have been to. I admit I have never visited India, but based on many examples in the US and other countries this would be number 1. Everything about it is accommodating for a delightful low key evening of excellent food. It is true ky a neighborhood gem.

Don’t Hesitate. A perfect introduction to this wonderful island and culture.,"I think our entire weeks stay was enhanced by this tour. We learned about the island, the culture and a little of the people of Ambergris Caye. Felipe is a wonderful guide and you will feel that you have made a local friend by the end of the tour. We ran into him several times and were greeted with a big warm smile each time. Of course we also visited restaurants that we returned to later in the week. The food on the tour was so good and the restaurants so hospitable that they became “our places”. The tour includes a lot of food so pace yourself, if you can. It is hard not to eat it all. You will also be offered a beer, rum drink or non-alcoholic option at each stop, so don’t eat the day of the tour. Whatever you do GO and say hi to Felipe for me.",January 2018,Belize Food Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g291962-d10379098-Reviews-Belize_Food_Tours-San_Pedro_Ambergris_Caye_Belize_Cayes.html,"Ambergris Caye, Belize",attractions,5.0,5.0
Amazing Great Little Place - a real find.,"This is one of those great little out of the way places that, if your lucky enough to get in, will quickly charm, entertain and delight you. Argile, the owner and most everything, is a trip - very gregarious, always moving, constantly smiling; a joy to watch. As he says, “I need a bigger place, but I don’t need a bigger place.” The restaurant only has about 21 seats and loses a couple on rainy nights, like when we were there. But Argile makes it fun and, of course, delicious. The creole sauce and the garlic coconut were fantastic. If you stop by during the day, he will save you a seat. It’s worth doing since word of mouth was sharing the “secret” of the Hungry Grouper during our stay.",January 2018,Hungry Grouper,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g291962-d8125498-Reviews-Hungry_Grouper-San_Pedro_Ambergris_Caye_Belize_Cayes.html,"Ambergris Caye, Belize",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Best stop for ceviche.,"Wild Mango’s offers a wider selection of great ceviche choices than anywhere else we found in San Pedro. Check out the option to pick 3 different recipes. Each has its own chip choice. It is on the appetizer section of the menu but makes a sizable lunch choice. Of course the drinks and view are unbeatable. Enjoy.

If you aren’t interested in ceviche (sorry) - the tacos are great too.",January 2018,Wild Mango's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g291962-d1238236-Reviews-Wild_Mango_s-San_Pedro_Ambergris_Caye_Belize_Cayes.html,"Ambergris Caye, Belize",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Does the world need another great burger place?,"Of course it does. Sometime a really great burger just can’t be beat, particularly if it has terrific fries and craft beer. This one is also accommodating with SMALLER versions of all their great burgers. Just ask, you don’t have to share or wast half a burger. You will be completely satisfied. It can get busy but that just proves it is great and it is worth the wait.

Oh wow! Go on pot au feu night!,Pot au feu is only offered three nights a week. Tuesday was one and I always pick the limited or special offer. It worked out here. Fantastic. A glass of excellent Eichhof Klosterbrau is all you need. They couldn't have been nicer to a group of non-German speakers. Reservation recommended; they are packed by locals. Alternatively go early and beg.

One entree is enough unless you have a big appetite,"The regular portion size on the ala carte menu is quite good. A first and third choice selection together was a sizable meal. As many others have mentioned this is contemporary Korean influenced cuisine. It is very inventive and very good. The octopus, first course selection, was exceptional (moderately spicy if worried). The tuna was seared beautifully and delicious.

Excellent - could not have been better,"I have seen some disparaging reviews and they are far from our experience (party of 5). Service was incredibly cordial and welcoming. Food was excellent; we shared a Bryndzové Halušky (English: potato dumplings with bryndza sheep cheese and bacon, is one of the national dishes in Slovakia) as an appetizer. Mint tea service was impressive and excellent. Stuffed peppers were delicious. Pig cheek stew with butter dumplings was warming and appropriate for the blustery spring day.

Overall, I would not hesitate to visit again.",April 2017,Zylinder - Cafe & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274924-d3322024-Reviews-Zylinder_Cafe_Restaurant-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Floyd's has whatever you are looking for,We have used Floyd's for a large group for several years because it can accommodate our group but also everyone's tastes. They are great at traditional fried seafood (the oysters are terrific) and always has great options and more unique specials. One tip is that Chef Floyd will also cook your catch after a day on the water. We brought in Mahi and cobia and he went all iron chef on several courses of family style offerings. It was terrific. I can recommend Floyd's no matter what your tastes.,June 2016,Floyd's 1921 Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49367-d2171553-Reviews-Floyd_s_1921_Restaurant-Morehead_City_North_Carolina.html,"Morehead City, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Simply the worlds best corned beef hash!,"I hesitate to tell you that it is that good, since I may no longer find it easy to get a seat. Based on many years of comparison, this home cooked, stringy, corned beef and hand cut potatoes, fried just so, are supreme. This stuff is pilgrimage worthy. I recommend either the corned beef hash and eggs or the skillet with hash, jalapeños and pepper jack. I would take the biscuit and add a side of excellent sausage gravy but it up to you. Just go try it, you'll see.",June 2016,Grumpy's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49367-d9736524-Reviews-Grumpy_s-Morehead_City_North_Carolina.html,"Morehead City, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Tasty, Fun & Memorable - What more can you ask of lunch?","My party found both the food and the view to be terrific. A particular shoutout to the pork chop. As just a lunch, this one is very very good, maybe a bit pricy. In combination with the setting, the glass floor and the pod it is the center of a great afternoon. The experience is up there with the best of the rotating restaurants and surpasses most observation towers. I would be sorry if we had missed it. I recommend it to you.",March 2016,360 The Restaurant at the CN Tower,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d681795-Reviews-360_The_Restaurant_at_the_CN_Tower-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Toronto, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Always fantastic - on Monday and Tuesday it is unbelievable.,"Wow what a place; Not inexpensive but always great. It has been our special occasion go to for some time. Monday and Tuesday is now a special occasion all by itself. They offer a prix fixe menu for $30 along with their regular menu. The prix fixe they say is a ""tasting"" menu but the portions are ample for anyone and too much for most. Think one 2 inch thick root beer roasted pork chop instead of two. Apps are fantastic I tried the gnocchi cake with red sauce and sausage. The ""giant rigatoni"" with shrimp, scallops and sea bass was terrific. Tiramisu for desert amoung other choices. Just go.
