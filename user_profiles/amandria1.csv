Gorgeous place due to delayed transport I missed my tour time and was told too bad by female staff,It was awful for me because I was late for my tour and their was NO flexibility.

We especially enjoyed the friendly Rayshark. He/she really loved a cuddle. The penguin tube is also inventive and fun.

"Really enjoyed, what dog sled rides 10.00? unheard of need to let folks know. Few improvements recommended for you.","Loved the tour and all the information given at each hut/dwelling. Excellent presentation by someone named John, I believe he said he was a Yupic? Wish we had gotten there sooner it was that good, however I have quite a few recommendations that I think would vastly improve there center. 1. Clothing the native clothing warn was so generic, there is such gorgeous native clothing to be worn it was so disappointing so see their clothing so bland, and it should be representative of each culture. 2. There was a health/medicine informational and it never explained native american medicine, I went to all of them/phones and none of them explained it in any detail, I think native american medical center would be amazing but it never got explained well. The dog sledding I had no idea it was there I could of saved a large sum of money and would of come sooner had I known you had $10.00 sled rides what a deal, I have kids I guarantee if you advertised this more, more of us with children would run not walk to save money. Only recommendation for the sweet girl with the team, is maybe a better set up to hold puppies so both kids/puppies safer than just a child's arms. Oh and gift shop, I know you want to be authentic but things made out of ivory are out of the budgets of many, some cheaper items would help you.

Nice little gem,When we went it was raining so many of the animals were trying to stay dry so we didn't see them in their dens. They had a lovely variety of animals to visit for us the wolves were the best as we had not seen. I enjoyed seeing very upclose the animals we had seen in denali or on a cruise.

"waiting for the rest of fantasyland to be finished, beautiful visually","Well we got lucky and had a rather cool, day the lines were really long. I almost feel like I should of gotten there at 8p.m. the park really slowed down at that time, and cooled off. The day was filled with super long lines but it was a gorgeous day. We went beginning of March. Visually the area in fantasyland with Ariel/Belle's area's. I went on the Ariel ride I really liked it very gentle.; grandaughter felt it should of had a little more of how the Seawitch was defeated. There is a beautiful tower for Rapunzel as you had to the Haunted house, besides being visually beautiful especially at night I am wondering what are they going to do with it? Snow White isn't open yet, it seems it needs more rides they made beautiful area for shops/food where are the rides maybe I missed something?",March 2014,Walt Disney World Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d143394-Reviews-Walt_Disney_World_Resort-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.5

Old Florida charm,"We came back here with our grandkids as our parents and grandparents brought us. We didn't catch the show you have to be in line 30 mins early and we didn't plan well enough. We did go to their spring fed water area called Buccaneer Bay as my grandson just couldn't wait for a show. The water is pretty chilly, I only but up to my belly before I quit. The kids did get used to it, there are 3 water slides and its part of the park price which is only 13.00 and kids 5 and under are free. Excellent prices. My grandson overcame his fear of heights slid down the slides. And a manatee swam within feet of us. It was the most thrilling part of the trip for us actually. You can go down and do a lazy river but a real river.",July 2013,Weeki Wachee Springs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34722-d108282-Reviews-Weeki_Wachee_Springs-Weeki_Wachee_Florida.html,"Weeki Wachee, Florida",attractions,5.0,4.0
