Safe neighbourhood,"Follow Rozengrct, and you are rewarded with a chilled-out neighbourhood with cheap gym facilities, ex-pat craft shops and nice sidewalk canals, with lots of young friendly people.

On the negative side the hotels are overpriced, as most in the center - so stay more towards vondell park. At least this area is safe from muggers.",December 2019,The Jordaan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190575-Reviews-The_Jordaan-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,3.0,4.5
Very popular cannibis cafe,"The atmosphere at the Bulldog Leidseplein is unforgettable. Always young, heaving and atmospheric, usually a lot of tourists's from UK drinking and smoking like the good old days! I've been to Amsterdam 5/6 times and each time I have a good time.

Since I've been old enough to smoke drugs, I come to the bulldog. Last time I brought a few Hash Moroccan pre-rolled!

My first experience of a Resort! Loved every minute!,"5 star rating! Absolutely brilliant family resort in a beautiful town on the Aegean coast!

Both the Hotel and Location! Just incredible!! - Child-friendly pools, free drinks all day and night, wonderfully cooked food, entertainment, friendly staff, and locals, Activities are the best! - Kayaking, Hand Gliding, The best beaches in the world!, Quad biking in ghost towns!

A great break, the lovely local town, cheap!

Perfectly charming stay - but people stay here to be close tot he airport lol !,"The staff very friendly and attractive, food and bar available, airport transfers free of charge also! Perfect!

Might I add, Hungarian comedy shows were very funny! Despite watching them on a very old TV! which you can ignore if your only staying for one night!

It's an adventure getting to this place from the veces ( nearby train station ) walking through the 'charmed shackled' suburban dwellings - before you reach the Hotel! lol",November 2019,Airport Hotel Budapest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1077276-d1108340-Reviews-Airport_Hotel_Budapest-Vecses_Pest_County_Central_Hungary.html,"Vecses, Hungary",hotels,4.0,3.5
Great Double room - Maybe the best in Athens,"I was not disappointed with this room - It was the most comfortable I have found in Athens, but not the cheapest! ... The breakfast was the best, very hot and plentiful and better than the other 3 I found on my travels.

I made the trouble of learning the local language that day and found myself having a great time! During my stay, there was a Jevoha's witness conference and the lobby was filled with very nice people.

Also, the other building next door has a swimming pool on the roof, but when I visited it was totally packed with people, it's more of a nice to have feature... because it didn't look very deep! but I can imagine on a sunny day it's perfect to sit outside on the balcony and have a drink from the bar by the pool! Perfect for families, maybe a solo traveller could find somewhere more student-focused",November 2019,Wyndham Athens Residence,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d13949988-Reviews-Wyndham_Athens_Residence-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Wonderful insight into Netherlands amongst the Sins of the Dam!,"The Jewish quarter and Anne franks are Amsterdam cities saving grace. The sensitivity and quality of the tour give you an idea of the real Netherlands.

"Desperate to avoid the flying pig, i stumbled into this overpriced gem!","For some unknown reason - My school and college, my friend's birthday choices have all resulted in me visiting the dam! So, I decided to backpack here solo backpacking and had a totally different experience!

This is in the redlight district and should only be used in emergencies!,"I have stayed here 3 times, once on a birthday weekend, once on a passing visit and again last year!

The area is terrible, your surrounded by basic brits! everyone is either on a stag do, come to sleep with prostitutes, or to smoke weed in one of the many cafes! This is not the real holland or Netherlands and is basically a circus for students on gap years!

Good location and does not look like the pictures!,"Accommodation in Amsterdam is always difficult! You either have overpriced rooms of the low quality of trashy backpacking rooms in the center! This was overpriced and I have learned my lesson on my 5th visit to Amsterdam!

Great location and high quality room,"My credit card was stolen in Barcelona, the day before and I was unable to find a room to stay in. I actually spent the night sat on a subway floor with my bag, until I could call my family the next day to wire me some funds.

The hotel let me charge my phone so I could call my family and I was so thankful for the clean bed and hot shower, so I could visit the Spanish police the following day to cancel my card and report the incident! What a nightmare! but thanks for the charge!

A cheap private hotel room in London Victoria is a rare comodity!,"I was surprised to find a room so cheap and close to Victoria, my train destination primarily!

"A cheap, but friendly backpacker hostel","This is a budget backpacker hostel, but coming from the UK, I found the service friendly. The pub crawl organized was a lot of fun and I met people from all across the world here fashion students from holland, students from Russia, China, Iran, and Australia all having fun together.

Students were all chilled here, even studying on their laptops instead of going to class!

A good base when in Rio!,"This hotel is in Lapa! So you are close to many pubs, clubs, tours, and sites.
You are minutes from 2 subway stations and if you want a late-night drink the area is open till very late (5 am, just be careful from the drunk people )
I recall the room was fine from memory, the staff was very helpful and the breakfast was fantastic!
Every morning I would use the gym and go for a quick swim at 7 am in the 30-degree heat!
The view is nothing special, but it was great value for money and I would highly recommend it!

Good Starting point for Athens travel,"I stayed here and there were many students staying here ( Which is a good sign.) I recall the breakfast bar upstairs has great views and the food was basic but nice. There's also a gym and overall was reasonable for the amenities it offered.

Quintessential Athens viewing,"My father lived in Athens for 2 months back in the 70s and I was interested to visit the country first hand myself. I found my first visit spell-binding, very unique and grand, but the temple of the gods was derelict. What was obvious when I went there was the country was falling apart. Lots of grand old buildings graffitied with political slogans

My perspective of Greece was always a Euro football win in circa 2002, and bearded philosophical artistic people, like the ones I met on my degree, so was keen to meet the greeks in there own country.

The country much like downtown Rome has remanence of Byzantine empires and a legacy of greatness which was in the center of the greek people. I was fascinated by the things id heard from the city and went to the Acropolis on the second day.

How will the Plato book I received make sense, compared to the architecture - or the mythology I studied as a child? I was not disappointed this was the place the wrestlers, the gladiators, and the fighters.

It is an iron age fort, a palace to the kings and homer once spoke about this in nietczhes 'birth of tragedy', built to defend the royalty from invaders, it has strong pillars made from stone, a grand entrance and is very high up.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Last minute Date Night (Unimpressed!),You do not have to book this resturant even on a busy Saturday evening.
