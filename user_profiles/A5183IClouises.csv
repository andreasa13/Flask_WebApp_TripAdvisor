Lively relaxed feel,A great place to stroll around. Be prepared for tourist prices you’ll find lovely restaurants and shops but you’ll find cheaper places to eat elsewhere but it’s worth spending time here it’s such a great atmosphere.,November 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Impressive,We initially drove past took photos and were happy with that but my son asked to go back and I’m glad we did as when you’re inside it’s a totally different experience it’s incredible the views are amazing and if you immerse yourself in the history you should enjoy it.,November 2019,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great way to see Athens and beach,We bought family tickets that gave 2 days hop on hop off. It was a very informative journey. The city tour took you to all the sights and we got on and off a couple of times no problems next bus is 15 mins later perfect way to get your bearings round the city! We used it the next day to go on the beach line which was lovely again very informative and easy to use. You could probably do this cheaper on the metro/buses but this was easy and regular and the commentary was so interesting. Would highly recommend.,November 2019,Athens Shore Excursion: Athens and Piraeus Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11458813-Athens_Shore_Excursion_Athens_and_Piraeus_Hop_On_Hop_Off_Bus_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.0
Beautiful,The area leading up to the Acropolis is so beautiful the houses are gorgeous there are little market sellers along the way selling homemade jewellery gifts and snacks which is nice to enjoy. We were fortunate to visit in a national holiday so it was free entry for all of us! It was so busy but not sure what it’s like normally. You can spend several hours up there enjoying the views and architecture we didn’t get a guide as it was all last minute but if you read up before hand you don’t need one. We were there late November it was very warm so I’d say I’m summer be well prepared with drinks hats etc. The flooring is uneven and quite slippery therefore sensible shoes with grips are a must. All our party aged 3to79 enjoyed the trip.,November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
NOISY! central apartment,"rented 3 (apt 2, 3&4) of 5 apts in block. located in a lovely safe area, walkable to Syntagma square. closest metro about 5 minutes walk. abundance of shops, cafes and restaurants.
Well equipped, everything you need for a home from home stay. Apt 4 was the only one with a washing machine. Comfy beds, great air conditioning, blackout shutters. Bright and very spacious apartments. Each has a balcony apartments 2 & 3 have 2 seater table on balcony, apt 4 has the biggest with a dining area outside, although it is a slightly smaller apartment inside. Nicely decorated, with modern furnishings. Lovely touch that there was a welcome pack of coffee tea, beer and juice, that was very appreciated.
Bad
The hot water has to be turned on and off, there was never enough hot water for everyone to have a shower. showers in 2&3 poor pressure, apt 4 had an amazing shower. The biggest issue is it was so noisy. You can hear everyone in other apartments. When the washing machine in apt 4 was on you could hear it in apt 2, 2 floors down. The worst was the fact that it is above a bar/cafe. On the night we arrived they were having a party and there was loud music and people shouting and smoking (which drfts up into the lower apts) until 3 am. The second night was similar then thankfully the 3rd night (sunday) they were closed so it was much better.

With all this is in mind I would recommend this apartment for friends and not families particularly with young children.",November 2019,Olala Kolonaki Boutique Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d17515071-Reviews-Olala_Kolonaki_Boutique_Apartments-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,3.0
"Delicious, authentic, good value for money wonderful!","We tried this out based on reviews found here, and we were overjoyed with our experience. Costas and is team are so welcoming, we did book as realised it was a busy place for lunch and we were a party of 13. We asked Costas to choose a selection of dishes for us and were able to try numerous authentic home cooked meals. It was all delicious! None of us could eat again that day! We loved it so much we returned the next day! Like others have said this is like having dinner at your friends house, it's very relaxed. We will definitely go back again on our next trip to Athens.",November 2019,5F,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d5312490-Reviews-5F-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Beautiful views and pool but not 5*,"Our party: 8 adults 5 children (3-13) Well travelled so lots to compare to.
Good:
All staff are helpful and friendly, very attentive night and day.
Breathtaking views from rooftop pool. Pool nice size. We were only ones using it most days. if more than 20 people wanting a bed this would be difficult.
Good facilities in rooms (gowns, slippers, generous and good quality toiletries). Comfy beds.
Free shuttle bus (although last one is a bit early)
Fairly central. 8 min walk to nearest metro, 40 min drive from airport. Bus stops close too.
Lots of cafes/bakeries/supermarket close by
Bad:
Air conditioning smells of damp, particularly bad in room 661.
Conference facilities share same area as pool therefore had to walk through business men in their coffee breaks whilst in swimming costumes ( a bit awkward!)
Flooring in pool is very slippery.
Parts of the hotel were dated
Very poor pressure in showers
Fridge dirty
Noisy from outside road - even on 6th floor - would be better if triple glazed windows
Turn down service is too late with a family (after 10 one night)
Very expensive prices for drinks and snacks (6 euro for a coffee)

I suggest that this hotel is more for business visitors than a family vacation.",November 2019,Divani Caravel Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d230392-Reviews-Divani_Caravel_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.5
