A great alternative to the many traditional restaurants,Beautiful locally sourced food and innovative dishes. Staff are very friendly and welcoming and are able to adapt dishes to suit dietary needs - a rare find in Athens. Great cocktails. The only thing I would say is that the portions are a bit too big and the desert was a bit bland - mascarpone and strawberries in a pastry basket.,November 2019,Old School - The Food Project,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14406700-Reviews-Old_School_The_Food_Project-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Not well maintained,"Busy, dirty and not well maintained - a bit disappointing. I think we had high expectations on our visit to Athens - don't expect a beautiful city with well maintained historical sites like Rome for example.",November 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Nice neighbourhood but..,Like most of Athens is quite run down and dirty. This is one of the nicer areas with plenty of restaurants and shops. Lots of beggars around and graffiti everywhere. Still felt safe walking around though. Beware of people giving out 'free' things - they want 'donations' in return and can get quite aggressive if you decline.,November 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
A bit disappointing,You must get here early to avoid the crowds otherwise it us awful. There was scaffolding on most of the stones which whilst obviously necessary slightly ruins the aesthetic - I don't think the site is very well maintained. Lots of rubbish around.,November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Excellent,One of the best museums we have been too - light airy and well laid out so all exhibits were displayed beautifully. The only down side was the miserable blonde woman on the ticket desk who was rather rude and abrupt which was completely unnecessary. All the other staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.,November 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Terrible Spa,The hotel is beautiful but the rooms can be quite noisy. The restaurant is great and the view is amazing. All the staff are friendly but the place is completely let down by the awful spa. Had a very weird massage that was also very painful. The staff in the spa are very rude and seem intent on selling products than ensuring that the treatments are up to scratch. There are no towels in the changing rooms and no robes or slippers - not very 5 star....It was altogether an unpleasant experience. We picked this hotel because it had a spa and I have given the hotel 1 star because of the spa experience. It ruined our stay here. We complained about the spa to the concierge who did nothing. Very disappointing. Having stayed in many 5 star spas and hotels around the world this place was a disappointment which is a shame because the rest of the staff/ hotels lovely.,November 2019,Electra Palace Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228901-Reviews-Electra_Palace_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,1.0,4.5
Great place to watch sport,Lots of screens and table service. Toilets can get a bit grim when it is busy. Convenient location too.,November 2019,Athens Sports Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2642955-Reviews-Athens_Sports_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Disappointing,"We came for afternoon tea and we emailed and called in advance to confirm dietary requirements for some of our group, one of whom had a serious allergy to milk products. Despite reassurances over the phone that they take this very seriously they still managed to give scones made with butter to this member of our group who was then very unwell afterwards and this ruined the birthday celebrations for the rest of the day. In addition the service was incredibly slow - we were ignored for quite sometime, plates were not cleared away, when we managed to flag down a member of staff to request more food or drink some items were ignored/ failed to materialise or just took an incredibly long time to arrive. Most of the staff were too busy folding napkins and gossiping with each other to tend to customers. Our waiter was quite rude to some of our party by insulting their appearance and dietary choices - I think he thought he was being funny - it wasn't. And to top it all off we were overcharged by Â£20 - disgusting.",October 2016,108 Brasserie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d730156-Reviews-108_Brasserie-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Dreadful,"By far the worst vegetarian food I have ever had - undercooked, Luke warm and flavourless it was inedible and the service was dreadful. Once seated we were ignored. No one came back to check if our food was ok and no one apologised when we tried to complain. Refused to take the inedible food off the bill and the waitress made a big scene about it, which just annoyed our party further hence the review. The food was taken off the bill and the bill slammed down on the table - really bad service. I can't understand why you would want to make an unhappy customer even more unhappy - certainly won't be returning and I strongly suggest you avoid this place - not worth it despite the hype.",May 2016,Manfreds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189541-d2536043-Reviews-Manfreds-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",restaurants,1.0,3.5
