Obviously a must-see in Athens,"To visit on of the 7 world wonders is clearly a must if you visit Athens. We were lucky that the weather was perfect, and clearly COVID-19 reduced the number of other tourists significantly. However, we were still not on our own. We opted for the audio-tour (with own smartphone as device) and although the tour is well prepared and in general very easy to understand, the COVID-caused new routings (walk on the right path) on some of the areas - and especially the top of the plateau with the Akropolis itself - deviated significantly from the flow of information and that was very confusing (as there is no option to select specific numbers according the attraction you’re in Front of you have to follow the one and only order of the lecturer). While this issue is understandable, it detracted quite a bit.

However, the impressive buildings deserve a visit at any given circumstances.",October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Very entertaining and enjoyable,"Although we were on a walking tour the day before, and naturally some attractions overlapped we really enjoyed this tour. We were a group of 8 from 3 different nations and our guide (D.) found the right tone and information for everyone.

The tour is well paced and a good mix of culture and history but also includes current cultural aspects.

The bikes are in good shape and comfortable to ride.

We highly recommend this tour/activity, regardless if it’s the only guided tour in Athens or if you want to add s
A little bit of sportive activity to your learning experience.",October 2020,Athens by Bike,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1783079-Reviews-Athens_by_Bike-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
