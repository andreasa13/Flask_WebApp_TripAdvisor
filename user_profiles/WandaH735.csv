If you like to eat,Cost is what usually determines who I fly with so they had the best rates. Comparable service to other airlines but the food! With such a long flight we had two meals and a snack. It helped pass the time because every time we were done seemed like out came more food. It was really tasty. We actually saw the chef and complimented him on our way out.,November 2019,Turkish Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729174-Reviews-Turkish-Airlines,World,flights,4.0,4.0
Great for many reasons,If you are coming in the off season the rates are super reasonable for the accommodations. It is spacious with updated furnishings. We stayed a week so appreciated the closet space and extra half bath. Location is perfect to walk almost anywhere- very central. Our companions had the penthouse...if you want a view- WOW! Full windows and balcony with perfect view of the Parthenon. **Only issue we had was on our morning of departure we were accidentally locked in to the building. I have suggested to the property that they should have a second exit and make adjustments to avoid this mishap in the future. Luckily we had an awesome taxi that waited for us to be 'let out' and still got us to the airport on time to make our flight. Stressful morning but what if there had been a fire??? This is a safety issue.,November 2019,Fos Residential Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d16755547-Reviews-Fos_Residential_Apartments-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Best city view,We took the cable car up only because I had a marathon the next day. But considering you can walk up for free- I bet the views on the walk are amazing as well. Definitely recommend to do if you are in Athens. Especially wonderful at sunset.,November 2019,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
If you like gelato then you love this,Visited many times during our week in Athens. Reasonable prices and such a variety. The gelato is so fresh! Unique flavors and definitely try some of the flavored cones!

Must see,Hey if you are already in Athens it would be a shame not to spend a few euro and take in the sites.

Would recommend a guide,We had done other day trips so to save a little money we viewed on our own. I find it more interesting to learn about the history in stories. Definitely doable on your own but wasn't exactly amazing for us.,November 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5

Surprisingly fantastic,"We were just walking around and very hungry. Stopped in here with low expectations for a place that looked like fast food....but the salads were amazing!!

Delphi day trip,"Great communication from the start. Nikos kept us informed of our
options and any necessary alterations. He was prompt and responsive
to our needs. Of course you want a guide to be knowledgeable and he
certainly is. We also enjoy someone you can connect with especially on
a trip with a long drive. Nikos has a pleasant sense of humor and was
willing to share other insights about life in Greece. All 4 of us had
a great day and highly recommend using Nikos for any tour he offers.
Thanks for a great experience!
The drive up into the mountains was beautiful and the ruins at Delphi with the museum are worth the trip. Very interesting...hint if you are a group of adults you probably need a rental as most locals drive smaller cars and you want to be comfortable",November 2019,Withlocals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12429012-Reviews-Withlocals-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Even a comp drink!,"Love that they fly out of my small local airport. Makes it very convenient and the prices are reasonable compared to driving 2+ hours and then paying for parking and/or a hotel depending on the time your flight leaves. This particular trip we were even offered a complimentary wine or beer! Not sure why but I'll take it. Crews have always been very professional and polite. Even when I got stuck overnight due to an equipment malfunction- they put us up in a nice hotel, provided a meal and bonus miles for the inconvenience.

Dont trust gps,"A little difficult to find...gps kept telling us we were there but obviously not. So either the address for this place needs to be adjusted or my gps was just ""off"". But once we finally found it we loved the hike. Options to take more challenging routes or stairs. Would have spent more time had it not been so windy and cold when we went but great views!",October 2017,Sugarloaf Mountain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g42441-d2209702-Reviews-Sugarloaf_Mountain-Marquette_Upper_Peninsula_Michigan.html,"Marquette, Michigan",attractions,4.0,5.0

Quick trip,Just one flight from my local airport over to Minneapolis for a long weekend and a family wedding. Reasonable rate made it much more convenient than the 6 hour drive.

Amazing salads,I'm on a 30 day detox diet yet found a few options to satisfy even the limited ingredients I'm following temporarily. The atmosphere is casual and I think they try to buy local so any time I can eat less processed and more locally sourced foods is a big win!,July 2017,The Moose Jackson Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g42339-d3576877-Reviews-The_Moose_Jackson_Cafe-Iron_Mountain_Upper_Peninsula_Michigan.html,"Iron Mountain, Michigan",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Updated nice rooms,"The location was ideal for a marathon race I was participating in. I was pleased to find reasonable rates for the convenience. The rooms were updated and very clean. Most happy that the staff allowed a late checkout that Sunday so I could actually take a bath after running for four hours. Nice parking options for a downtown hotel.

Amazing flavor,Many options on the menu- quite a few away from standard Italian usually offered at restaurants. I had the chicken marsala with orzo- the flavor was amazing. The fresh bread and dipping oils were great as well. I would have loved a dessert but had absolutely no room. Portions sizes are very ample- took over half home with me and made for great left overs. Fun environment.,April 2017,Benvenuto's Italian Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60168-d2434051-Reviews-Benvenuto_s_Italian_Grill-Oshkosh_Wisconsin.html,"Oshkosh, Wisconsin",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Indoor marathon- awesome training facility,"I was here for a half marathon. The facility looks awesome and the national speed skating team was there training. Lots of room on the ice with two rinks, ice oval, and a 3 lane track around that. Plenty of bleacher area for spectators. I'm not aware of what the charges are (if any) to use the facility but it's probably worth it. Lots of parking too.

Tasty & reasonable,"I am from Michigan and went with friends from the area. It was Sunday brunch time so maybe a hectic day to be there. We knew the server and she was fabulously friendly. However, the food took forever to get and my friend mentioned they don't offer the all you can drink mimosa sunday special anymore (which means her bill was larger than she expected). I love the single size desserts that are a good deal but felt it was unimpressive in texture and taste. Beautiful views available from many areas.

Fantastic food!,"I was here twice with friends (I'm not a big drinker). I did try some beers off a sample pallet and even though I don't like beer much- with how many selections they have, even I found some tasty offerings. Both times I did order food and since I'm not into drinking much I will say the food was fabulous! Don't underestimate because you think it's a ""bar"". The decor is authentic and awesome as well.

THE place for downtown events,I was here for an event with activities also in the hotel but we relished in the 'Presidential Club' level- great view from our room plus nightly appetizers and desserts in the the club.

Classic location - old/slow service,"It's a historic type building and nostalgia items on the inside so I don't discredit that it is small and somewhat out of date- but so was the help...slow, not super friendly and worse I think I was overcharged but didn't get a receipt so I couldn't tell.

Good for a variety of ages.,Reasonably price for an afternoon with my teens. For $10 we got enough tokens to putz around for an hour or two. WARNING- flaming finger game is the worst scam we found. Unless you just want to trade a token for 10-12 tickets- skip this. Sure I realize it's like a casino and most things are very difficult to succeed at but with two of us...we could watch the screen while the other played...the timer speeds up as you near the end (there is a warning on the game though it's hard to understand). Not sure it is possible at all to win. Otherwise- just have fun playing games with your kids.,June 2016,Funset Boulevard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30330-d7106821-Reviews-Funset_Boulevard-Appleton_Wisconsin.html,"Appleton, Wisconsin",attractions,4.0,4.0

on time & decent service,"flight was well announced, left on time and service on board was fine. the staff at Chicago airport (from security, etc) seemed well trained and professional...I know this is separate from the airline but I cant find a way to rate the airport when compared to Miami- I will avoid flying to that airport again for sure!",February 2016,American Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729020-Reviews-American-Airlines,World,flights,4.0,3.0
Scary- do not stay here,"The travel agent booked this for stay & park package. Yes the hotel was under construction so maybe in the future it will be better- but room was certainly outdated, not clean looking and refrigerator in room was moldy. We just needed to catch a flight in the morning so we slept on top of the sheets & kept our luggage off the floor for fear of bugs. WORST- they want you to leave the keys for your vehicle- that seemed strange & when I asked why the response was for in case of emergency. Well considering their paper said they are not responsible for damage (granted theft or buglary, etc that is why I have car insurance) including 'loss' yet I should leave them access to my car? Talked to my agent and she could only presume they move the vehicles off location to make room while we are gone. Well even though this was located near the airport so not a glamorous part of town- it looked like there could be drug dealers wandering around but they must think I was smoking something if I'm going to leave my keys so you can drive my vehicle around and then not hold you responsible for any potential damage...I took my keys with and lucky for them it wasn't towed or moved while we were gone. Just very sketchy place and lots of staff did not have great English so difficult to communicate my concerns.

Interesting to see but not in great part of town,Like many attractions in southern california- it's just part of town and not always in the greatest areas.

Nice but not warm enough,Oddly we hit a 'cold' spell in Florida so at temps in the 50s they shut the park early that day. There were a few attractions with warmed water that we stuck to and obviously the place was pretty deserted so it didn't take long for us to try every ride. don't expect too much from the 'shark' slide- you go through the tube so fast you aren't going to really experience being under the water but it's a nice idea.,September 2015,Aquatica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d1016290-Reviews-Aquatica-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.0

Epcot especially offers more for learning about other cultures...take a trip around the world in one day. I felt this was the most educational for us and our kids.",September 2015,Epcot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d126541-Reviews-Epcot-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great experience- worth the price,"We booked this through our cruise ship but between all the dolphin experiences offered at each stop- this was the only one I saw that was all inclusive (food & drinks) and it was the SAME price! So we made the most of our travel $$$. The staff was friendly & entertaining- I like jokes & comedy to make the experience more enjoyable. We were one of the last tours of the day which made it awesome to eat (not as busy) and we enjoyed our complimentary drinks (which were a nice selection of beers & mixed- and made stronger than the ones on the ship) while being able to observe the dolphins just swim around. It was calm and lovely. Had a few too many complimentaries but I didn't have to pay for any on the ship that day :)
NOTE: if you don't read carefully in advance- yes ALL jewelry, rings, earrings, and hair pieces (except a ponytail band) do have to be removed for dolphin safety. I applied sunscreen far in advance so it had time to soak in before rinsing to enter the pool. Dolphin safety is important and you can't have that coming off into the water. Pay the price- get a lifetime experience and if you just buy the dvd ($100) of your visit then screen shot photos for yourself and skip the ridiculous print prices at the shop. Watch out for the amazing comp drinks!",February 2016,Dolphinaris,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150809-d911372-Reviews-Dolphinaris-Cozumel_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cozumel, Mexico",attractions,5.0,4.5
Off the beaten path,A great place that locals like but not well known to tourists. It's a small beach but lovely & clear. Our running group ended here and it was a fabulous quiet are to relax for part of the afternoon.,February 2016,Smith Cove,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147365-d149252-Reviews-Smith_Cove-Grand_Cayman_Cayman_Islands.html,Grand Cayman,attractions,4.0,4.5
Only affordable place,Wandering around this airport- (because there was no maps for shops/restaurants) the prices were all outrageous...I expect airport prices to be high but these all seemed to be ridiculous. This place was a relief with reasonable prices and great tasting food. Head here first if you need to eat in Miami airport,February 2016,The Clover Irish Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34438-d6003170-Reviews-The_Clover_Irish_Pub-Miami_Florida.html,"Miami, Florida",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Airport hotel?,"Granted I'm a small town girl but this far exceeds what I expect from an airport hotel location. Very stylish, super clean, really helpful staff and reasonable (for Miami) rate. First class workout room, food at restaurant was great and not too expensive and even the outdoor pool is warm and well kept. We were just here one night on the way to a cruise but could easily have relaxed here one more day. It helped put our trip on the right track after a nightmarish start in Chicago.",February 2016,Element Miami International Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34438-d2153356-Reviews-Element_Miami_International_Airport-Miami_Florida.html,"Miami, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.0
Awesome mexican,"Selections of all kinds- this week I had vegetarian tacos! Beef, shrimp, chicken, etc if there is a combination you like I am sure it is on the menu.

"Test group, very safe & fun- no regrets!","I actually took my German exchange daughter here the first year they opened. She wanted to do it before going home and my kids were too afraid. We had an awesome time together doing something out of our comfort zone. Even though the company was new, the guides showed that safety was a #1 priority. Both guides were fun and we could joke around. We also had very nice people in our group to talk to. I wasn't so keen on the adventure bridges but once you start- there's no looking back. Great way to see some forest and the lake view from over it on the last zip was awesome! This was also reasonably priced for the amount of activities compared to other zip lines that had shorter courses.",October 2014,"Northwoods Zip Line, Aerial Trekking, Argo ATV, and Kayak River Tours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60100-d6867348-Reviews-Northwoods_Zip_Line_Aerial_Trekking_Argo_ATV_and_Kayak_River_Tours-Minocqua_Wiscon.html,"Minocqua, Wisconsin",attractions,5.0,5.0
