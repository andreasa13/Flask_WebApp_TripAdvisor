Authentic and amazing value,This is phenomenal. The food here is extremely tasty and comes in very generous quantities. Each salad is enough for about 3 people so order one between you alongside other dishes. The Green salad with roasted veg was my favourite. Half a litre of a very drinkable white wine for just 3 Euros was an astonishing price compared to a single glass for 5 only a couple of blocks away.. Because this place is so good it is full of locals in the evenings especially - but you can book a table and I strongly recommend you do.,April 2019,Opos palia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4195130-Reviews-Opos_palia-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing historical site,"If you are visiting Athens you will of course visit the Acropolis and all its famous monuments which do not disappoint. By going slightly out of (or just at the start/end of) the season you will avoid some of the overcrowding and have better temperatures in which to appreciate the majesty of the buildings. Do look out for pickpockets, however, at any time. Take your own water - the pigeons also use the water fountains near the toilets to drink from and bathe in. See if you can spot the tortoises!",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Best area in Athens for visitors,Ok it is touristy but there are also good quality restaurants amongst the tourist traps and go just a couple of streets off the main drag to find great food at really low prices.,April 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Wonderful building housing well presented artefacts,"Well worth visiting before you venture onto the Acropolis itself to get the historical context. The building itself is a work of art - light, roomy and accessible",April 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Wonderful flavours, attentive staff",Beautifully prepared food with fabulous flavours. The olive paste is quite simply out of this world. Vegetarian moussaka was really good as was chicken souvlaki which also came beautifully presented. The portion size for baklava was enough to feed two (at least) and the staff are attentive and charming. If you are visiting the Acropolis then this is a great place for lunch or evening meal - we enjoyed our evening meal so much we had lunch there another day.,April 2019,Gods' Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1724517-Reviews-Gods_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Excellent location and very well appointed apartments.,The location is brilliant - both main metro lines are in easy walking distance as is the Colosseum. The on-site manager is very welcoming and helpful. This is where we have stayed on each of our visits to Rome in recent years.,November 2018,Colosseo Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d5075659-Reviews-Colosseo_Gardens-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
Fabuloe,"Wonderful, but go early or late to avoid the crowds and be to be able to enjoy the paintings to the fullest. Between 11 and 3 it is mobbed!
The cafe is pretty good as well.",March 2016,Van Gogh Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190554-Reviews-Van_Gogh_Museum-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
Vila Baia keeps on delivering,"This was our second stay in this delightful residence and certainly won't be our last. This place is great for those who want the convenience of self catering facilities, but with the kind of customer experience that is more usually found in hotels. Our apartment was clean and very well set up - 2 litres each of fresh water and milk in the fridge, dishwasher and washing machine tabs provided and toiletries in the bathroom. Excellent parking away from the main bustle but still only a short walk to the beaches, shops and restaurants. Plus of course a great restaurant on-site as well. There is a TV, media centre and free wi-fi - but with 2 pools, great beaches and beautiful Portuguese scenery on the doorstep who needs them!",May 2014,Hotel Baia da Luz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g776012-d1872870-Reviews-Hotel_Baia_da_Luz-Luz_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Luz, Portugal",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Good variety, consistently high quality and great value","This is a superb restaurant that also offers takeaway on pizzas and pastas. We've stayed in Luz a couple of times and always eat here several times each trip. From our last visit, I'd recommend the seafood linguine or an excellent mushroom risotto and, if you like a thin crust pizza, you'll love the range served here.

Portion sizes are very generous - a starter of garlic bread and olives for one is easily as large as a similar starter for two elsewhere and a daily special of lamb chops with rosemary sauce (gorgeous) came with no fewer than five of them plus rataouille and potatoes.

The staff are unfailingly friendly, helpful and attentive and one, final, really great feature is the choice available for vegetarians - something which can be a bit of a struggle in other places.

Wine list is so-so but there are lovely ciders to choose from as well.

The only improvement would be if the 'outside' seating was genuinely outside, rather than in a form of conservatory. I suppose the plastic sheeting keeps the insects at bay but it would be lovely to be able to sit outdoors in the restaurant and not just in the bar.",May 2014,Restaurant Alloro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g776012-d2358511-Reviews-Restaurant_Alloro-Luz_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Luz, Portugal",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great views and an historic location,"The views of the atlantic from the fortaleza are absolutely stunning so don't come to this part of the algarve without paying a visit.

There is plenty of parking, loads of space for children to run around on the fort walls or open ground but sadly not too many places to sit down and no shade on the walk around the cliff edges. Coach trips seem to get here late morning but the place is big enough to prevent it feeling crowded, so don't let that dictate your timing. Because of the exposed location the wind is also strong so hold onto your hats and don't forget the suncream.

On the other side of the safety lines from the tourists, you can see the local fishermen using rod and line to bring up their catch from the sea far below. Signs describe the types of birds that can be seen as well as the various plants, many flowering, that carpet the exposed landscape.

Historically there are old cannons and some information boards/exhibitions to see, but rather less than you might expect from what was clearly a very significant site over the ages. I am sure when I was last here a couple of years ago (Sept) the historical importance was more to the fore, but it definately felt underplayed this time round (May). The upside of this low-key approach is that the place feels more raw and part of the natural environment than it would if given the full treatment more common in other places. The downside is that you are left with questions as to how the fort would have felt and appeared in its heyday.",May 2014,Forte da Ponta da Bandeira,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189117-d4882783-Reviews-Forte_da_Ponta_da_Bandeira-Lagos_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Lagos, Portugal",attractions,4.0,3.5
Great rooms and friendly staff,"Stayed here on a business trip recently. I really enjoyed the comfy bed and got a great night's sleep even though my room was close to the list lobby and so potentially could have been noisy. Room service food was tasty and good value and the staff were very helpful and welcoming. I would offer this thought for improvement - breakfast was fine and fairly typical but some different breads would have been good. The little white rolls were ok but the only brown bread was sliced - come on Marriott, thre must be a decent baker that could supply you and your visitors a choice. Other than that this is the best hotel in the area that I have stayed at.",April 2013,Newcastle Gateshead Marriott Hotel MetroCentre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190793-d192883-Reviews-Newcastle_Gateshead_Marriott_Hotel_MetroCentre-Gateshead_Tyne_and_Wear_England.html,"Gateshead, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent tour company with outstanding customer service,"Just back from a fantastic week in Akureyri which is a picturesque gem of town. We have nothing but praise for the quality of the tours and excellent service provided by the team at Saga travel. When we arrived in Iceland both of us went down with flu and no way could we go out on the northern lights trip planned for our first night. Kata from Saga could not have been more helpful telling us just to rearrange when we felt better. A few days later we joined Haraldur and some other visitors on a very successful northern lights search party! We also had a great day trip to lake Myvatn with Gunnar who was really knowledgeable and full of information about the sights. The timings were really good too - plenty of opportunity for photos and we never felt rushed like you can with some tour operators. We even had time to pat some beautiful and quiet Icelandic cows. Once again Saga went the extra mile with customer service, taking two of our party who weren't keen on a dip in the geothermal pool to a (fantastic) local bird museum while the other two enjoyed the hot springs. While our guys were fantastic, the Icelandic people are so friendly I'm sure the other tour guides in the area are probably great as well. However, the next time we return to Akureyri (and we definately will), we will be going straight to Saga travel to arrange our sightseeing.

Thank you Saga and particularly Gunnar for a wonderful tour and for suggesting the Bird Museum",April 2013,Saga Travel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189954-d2226993-Reviews-Saga_Travel-Akureyri_Northeast_Region.html,"Akureyri, Iceland",attractions,5.0,5.0
Perfect Icelandic scenery on a perfect Icelandic horse,"I have just spent a wonderful afternoon riding out on a well-behaved and charming Icelandic horse. I was lucky with the weather and got to experience a stunningly beautiful April day with blue skills and dazzling white snow everywhere. This has been a long winter and the temperature was still very low. Thick overalls were provided to keep out the chill wind and they did a great job. Our guide (whose name I have forgotten - sorry) was really friendly and helpful and we were able to get in several episodes of Tolt during the one and half hour ride, as well as a couple of short gallops. Tolt is one of the Icelandic horse's unique paces and if you are keen on horses you can't go home without trying it - bit bouncier than the the guidebooks imply but still comfy! Take a pocket camera so when you stop on top of the hill you can take a photo or two of the magnificent views. Topping off the afternoon was great coffee and Juliane's tasty home made cinnemon cakes and doughnuts. A fabulous trip that I would recommend to anyone!",April 2013,Polar Hestar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189954-d1907268-Reviews-Polar_Hestar-Akureyri_Northeast_Region.html,"Akureyri, Iceland",attractions,5.0,5.0
Good convenient hotel,"I stay here a lot when in London and the rooms are always comfy with generous sized beds. Breakfast has a great buffet. I'm not one for a cooked meal at the start of the day but there is plenty of hot food on offer as well. The dining room is pretty typical of hotels of this type and although I usually eat with colleagues in one of the many pubs and restaurants in the area, the few times I have eaten in have been very satisfactory. One of the little touches I really like is the free mineral water in the bedroom. I now feel I'm being short-changed if I stay in another hotel that doesn't offer this so I guess I've been spoiled! The view over St Pancras and the British Library from the glass-walled lift lobby on the upper floors is fantastic.",April 2013,Pullman London St Pancras Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d192068-Reviews-Pullman_London_St_Pancras_Hotel-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
