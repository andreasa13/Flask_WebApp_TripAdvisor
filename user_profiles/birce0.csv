good,"good but after seeing ephesus city ruins in izmir turkey, akropolis seemed small to me. the attraction was that it is on a high hill, you can see all the athens in a panaromic view.",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Highly recommended,"Clean and renewed room, comfy bed, these are like a 5 star hotel. Friendly staff. Location is excellent. Being near a famous square makes it safe (however you dont want to walk further that street). almost all of the touristic attractions are in 15 minutes walking distance. For breakfast you go to the other building (There are two 360 hotel buildings, one is right in the center of monastiraki, the other-pop art one is 50 meters away.)
To conclude, this hotel will meet your luxury and location expactations.",November 2019,360Degrees Pop Art Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d12836179-Reviews-360Degrees_Pop_Art_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
