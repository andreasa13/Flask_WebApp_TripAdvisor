Must tour,We had a beautiful day to tour the Acropolis. I'm glad it was in October but still quite busy. Be careful of the slippery steps.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
All foodies- a must for your Greek food senses,"We were invited to join some folks we just met off the plane in our tour group and I am so glad we did. The food was delicious and kept coming as we chatted with new friends that we ended up hanging with the rest of our tour. It all added to the ambiance of viewing the Acropolis from the 7th floor balcony. Giannis, Konstantinos and their mother were wonderful hosts. We had lots and lots of food, wine, beer and laughs. Come hungry as you will not be disappointed and the standards of the rest of the meals you will have in Greece is set very high. We loved it so much we went back for our last night in Athens adding 4 others to our group of 11.",October 2019,Giannis & Konstantinos of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d15835515-Reviews-Giannis_Konstantinos_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Fun tour with great food. Highly recommend,We had a great time with Craig on the Central Food tour. The menu items he picked for us to taste were delicious and had a hard time picking our favorite one. Come hungry because you will leave full. Craig is engaging and we shared some good laughs. He shared some history of St. Pete that now I know why some things are named the way they are. I highly recommend this tour.,August 2019,Premium Food Tasting Tour around Central Ave with Local Guide,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g34607-d15153983-Premium_Food_Tasting_Tour_around_Central_Ave_with_Local_Guide-St_Petersburg_Florida.html,"St. Petersburg, Florida",activities,5.0,5.0

Ratings are so wrong,"We stayed here at the end of Oct 2018 based on reviews and ratings i thought I made a good choice. Wrong. I don't know if it was just our room #304 but walls were scratched up and filthy. Closet smelled like old dirty clothes so we didn't hang anything. Bathroom shower had mold all around the bottom and shower ceiling. There was a smell on our last night coming from the bathroom that almost made me puke. I think it was from the sewers as it has been raining alot. There is a lot of homeless people sleeping in the area of that does not bother you.
On the positives Breakfast was good, the people working there were so nice and helpful with directions. Metro is minutes away. Termini is 20 min walking with luggage.",October 2018,DVE Suite Rome,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d6586129-Reviews-DVE_Suite_Rome-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,2.0,4.5
"Great food, service and the best tiramisu EVER!!","Was recommended by Valeria at Villa Manning and she did not steer us wrong. Relaxing atmosphere, great wait staff. The dishes we had were flavorful, fresh and great including the pasta. Decided to order the Tiramisu and it was the best EVER. I won't spoil the secret but you must try it. Then you will see how many come out of the kitchen.",October 2018,Ristorante Pizzeria Tasso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187782-d3575191-Reviews-Ristorante_Pizzeria_Tasso-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Sorrento, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great place to watch a football game if you are a Steeler fan,"I knew of this place and there happened to be a Steelers football game while we were in Rome. So it was a must stop on our list. Everyone was having a great time, other fans were enjoying the game and the place was crowded. Giovanni made his rounds to make sure everyone was taken care of. We met some nice folks that gave us recommendations for dining which we visited the next day and was super good.",October 2018,La Botticella,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d5924324-Reviews-La_Botticella-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Must visit,If you missed buying any food item while you were in Italy this is the place to stop and get it. It is a foodie store overload delight. Complete with places to eat and drink. It was hard choosing a place to eat.,October 2018,Eataly Milano Smeraldo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187849-d2219219-Reviews-Eataly_Milano_Smeraldo-Milan_Lombardy.html,"Milan, Italy",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Amazing dining experience,"From the moment we arrived we were well taken care of. I made reservations a couple months prior and I can see why. A wonderful place for a celebration or splurge. We each chose a different menu so we could try everything. Attention to detail in the presentation, the food and service was beautiful. We felt like Queens. Each entree was a treat to enjoy rounded out with the dessert and petit fours presentation. Take a picture of the menu so you can go back and see what you ate. We got to meet many members of the Iaccarino family as they come to your table to chat with you. We also toured the Wine and cheese cellar. It was one of my top 2 favorite dining experiences.",October 2018,Ristorante Don Alfonso 1890,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g644245-d716377-Reviews-Ristorante_Don_Alfonso_1890-Sant_Agata_sui_Due_Golfi_Massa_Lubrense_Province_of_Na.html,"Sant'Agata sui Due Golfi, Italy",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Small group tour good to take,We loved the small group tour of about 20 people. We took it from Sorrento. Mariano was entertaining as our guide. You can take an optional boat our when you get to Amalfi that I would recommend as you get to see the villages from the sea point of view. Beautiful pictures. Brown bag lunch was just ok as you are eating it on the boat. All in all a good tour that we enjoyed.,October 2018,Travel Etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187782-d10200565-Reviews-Travel_Etc-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Sorrento, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wonderful place to stay,"Host Valeria is most helpful and cheerful and recommended great place for dinner. Spacious room, clean with big bathroom and very nice shower.
