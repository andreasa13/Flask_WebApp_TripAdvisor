Skopelos Village Hotel,"We booked this hotel on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews which were very helpful, we would certainly disregard some of the more negative views given.

We very much enjoyed our stay Skopelos Village Hotel. It has a relaxed atmosphere and the rooms are spacious. We had room 12 which has a view of the pool and the town. It is on two levels with two balconies. We enjoyed the pool, gym and spa. Olga the masseuse was superb. I had an hour deep tissue massage that was amazing.
Breakfast is a buffet form, taken in the covered terrace overlooking the town.

The location of the hotel is close to the town which is a 8-10 minute walk away. The town’s restaurants and bars cater for most tastes.

We hired a car for a couple of days and toured all around the island. There are a number of very good beaches. Some picturesque and unspoilt, others a little more developed.
We took an organised boat trip to Alonissos which was great, swimming fro the boat near an uninhabited island.

We would certainly recommend this hotel.",September 2019,Skopelos Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189501-d254225-Reviews-Skopelos_Village-Skopelos_Sporades.html,"Skopelos, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5

Acropolis,"Such an amazing place, so much history.
I have wanted to visit Athen and the Acropolis for many years. It did not disappoint. The tickets can be purchased in advance, on-line cover a number of historical sights.

Probably the best view from a rooftop bar and restaurant in Athen,We stayed at the Electra Metropolis for five nights. I had pre-booked a table from the UK for dinner on our fist night. Such a great view. We had the corner table. All tables have a great view. The corner table has possibly the best view. The bar is very relaxed and has an upper outside area. The food and wine was very good.,September 2019,Metropolis Roof Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d11750196-Reviews-Metropolis_Roof_Garden-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A fantastic museum with stunning architecture.,"I had read about this museum and was very impressed with the location, the presentation of the objects held within the fantastic architecture. Well worth a visit.",September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Hotel in a great location and best views of the Acropolis from the Rooftop Bar,"We stayed at the Electra Metropolis Hotel in Athens in September, 2019.

All the staff during our stay of 5 nights were very pleasant and always helpful.

We chose a room on the six floor which was on the Acropolis side, but without a view, as the higher floors had a view. The bar and restaurant has the commanding views over Athens, so we did not feel we needed to pay an additional cost for the view from our room as well. The room was very well appointed, always kept clean, also very quiet, considering the location.

Breakfast is taken on the rooftop terrace, which is buffet style. Orders can be placed for eggs. Watching the sun rising is amazing.

The rooftop pool is good, with loungers on three sides. The adjacent bar offers snacks and drinks. There is a gym in basement which is rather small. There is an additional small pool here for guest’s use linked with the Spa.

We very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel for its great location for all the sights, shops, museums and galleries, most locations are an easy walk away.",September 2019,Electra Metropolis Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d10798588-Reviews-Electra_Metropolis_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Sunday lunch,"We have visited The Peterboat in Old Leigh a number of times, this is in such a great location. Every time we have had lunch it has been very good. Last Sunday we visited with Family and we had another great meal. All of the serving staff were very friendly and always helpful.
We shall of course revisit again soon!
Our servers were Joelle and Alice, they were so welcoming.",June 2018,The Peterboat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1138967-d3308529-Reviews-The_Peterboat-Leigh_on_Sea_Southend_on_Sea_Essex_England.html,"Leigh-on Sea, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
