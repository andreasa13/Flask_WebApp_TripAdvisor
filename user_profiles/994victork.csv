Interesting menu but disappointing taste,"Small, packed but they found us a table. I like different foods and the menu was very tempting. An appetizer of skewered veal hart pieces was very tasty. But my entree of ""Arroz Con Mariscos"" which they describe as Peruvian paella had shrimp, octopus, etc that disappeared in a ton of overcooked rice and while they were individually tasty, they did not blend. So the dish ended being filling but tasteless.",January 2019,Puerto 511,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60811-d6367311-Reviews-Puerto_511-Baltimore_Maryland.html,"Baltimore, Maryland",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Worth a detour,"A little bit further away from Inner Harbor but worth a visit. Just before heading that way I had reserved online a table: smart move. It was Friday night and the place was packed - it did not help that there was a large meeting at the Baltimore Convention Center. I had arrived a few minute early and was told to wait at the bar 10 minutes. I was skeptical seen the crowd. Wrong, I was seated before the time promised. I asked advice for a typical Afghani dish and got the Zardalu Challow, lamb cubes in a sweet and hot sauce/paste, over rice. The lamb was tender and the combination delicious. Less so the Feereny dessert: an Afghani flan covered in fruit. The service was friendly and fast but not hurried and I left in less than 45 minutes from when I entered the restaurant.

Overrated restaurant,"Fairly good but not outstanding food. The cook seems to be very fond of sweet sauces, but since we do not like them, that leaves fewer dishes to choose from. The portions are ""normal"" and not supersized as in many other Greek restaurants and for us that was OK.
Although the restaurant is open to the street and offhand looks similar to the standard establishments that beckon to the tourist in Greece, there are many personal family touches that give it a distinguishing character. Also, table cloth instead of paper, in an attempt to position itself as more upscale. Still I found the prices too high - from 50% to 75% higher than most other restaurants we went to with not inferior and sometimes better food.",August 2018,Ellevoro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d11917392-Reviews-Ellevoro-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Excellent modern Greek cuisine,"This is NOT the same food you get in the standard Greek restaurants around Athens. It may be based on traditional Greek cuisine, but it is prepared in a much more sophisticated way. All the dishes we ate were excellent. The service is good, the ambience on the rooftop terrace is nice (but, alas, no great views).

Overrated,"The food is OK, but not great (the octopus was not so fresh and was too cooked, the souvlaki was OK but not very tasty, etc). The price is higher than comparable type of restaurants (but with better food). At the time of paying they told us they had a problem with their CC machine and so we had to pay cash. That happened to us in few restaurants in Greece: any connection with the fee the restaurant has to pay? (Somehow the CC readers of shops where you can walk out seem to work perfectly). Although there were enough Greek dishes to choose from, to us having a restaurant touting Greek and Texan cuisine and greeting you with Mexican salsa+chips was a turn-off.

Disappointing restaurant,"The food was average, but quite overpriced compared to other restaurants in the area (some items 50% higher). The service lacked the warmth and hospitality one starts getting used to in Greece. Also, this was the first establishment in a week in Greece that refused to accept a credit card (Visa) without even bothering to offer an explanation.

"Impressive site, but too little explanations","This site contains a very large amount of ruins of which way too little has been restored. For instance, the temple of Zeus has only one standing columns, but plenty of seemingly intact columns that lie on the ground. Even a few more erect columns would give a much clearer and better feeling for the original temple. OK, doing that may cost some monies. But posting more explanations near the ruins costs next to nothing and it is standard in all the other archaeological sites I visited in Greece. Here, at least one third of the explanatory tables are blank. Neither my tour book, nor having studied (and photographed) the model of the site in the museum were enough. On hindsight I should have booked a private guide to tell me what I was actually seeing.",August 2018,Archaeological Site of Olympia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189487-d243256-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Olympia-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Perfect place to stay if you do not need 5 star hotels,"Pros: in the center of Delphi, a few minutes from the archaeological sites. George is an extremely helpful and friendly host-everything you need to know about visiting Delphi you can ask him. Comfortable very quite small room. Good breakfast. The hotel has just a few rooms - no noisy groups. You cannot beat the price.
Cons: parking is hard to find, but George kept a place for us and then we left the car there during our visit. Anyhow, there is no use for a car in Delphi.

Very good food,"The food was simple but very good: perhaps the best we had so far (several restaurants in Athens and Delphi). We had lunch and the 6 complete meal menus covered all the typical Greek foods. Very tasty and good value. The service was also very good.

Good Polish cusine,"I went in for duck and was not disappointed. the meal started with a complimentary spread of minced/shredded duck which was really tasty. I had duck carpaccio as an appetizer-never heard about it. Not particularly interesting but not bad. The main course roasted duck - a large portion - in a sauce that kept the duck moist but somewhat covered it’s taste. The cheese cake had a different taste than the one standard in the USA, not bad but also not very interesting. Side dishes for the main meal are extras, which brings the price up.

Really not so interesting,"It puzzles me why this is one of the top tourist attractions in the region. Yes, it is a huge salt mine of which the tour visit covers only 1% but that 1% is already plenty to cover in a 2-2.5 hr visit. Let me list the things I found (moderately) interesting.
The color of the salt walls (mostly black), while I was expecting (wrongly) white. The rock salt itself being so hard and so smooth when you walk on it. The guides encourage you to lick it (their stock joke is that the ticket entitles you to take away 2 kg of salt, provided you lick it from the walls). The older logs used to support the walls that are encrusted by salt. The pulleys used to lift up the salt barrels etc and lower down the logs. And yes, but less, the part that is most frequently quoted: the statues roughly sculpted by the miners and the chapels in the mine. Some big halls, and some small brine lakes. Several chandeliers with salt crystal in lieu of glass crystals.
All in all, I do not regret having invested the time, because now I have an idea of how this (and possibly other similar) salt mines looked like.",July 2018,Wieliczka Salt Mine from Krakow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g274772-d11465021-Wieliczka_Salt_Mine_from_Krakow-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",activities,3.0,4.0
Really efficient,"I booked only one tour, but am glad to report that everything went well. They picked me up from the hotel on time with a shuttle where I was the only passenger and they took me to meet the main bus. The person in charge spoke an excellent English, was friendly and extremely efficient. The logistics of handling large group and passing it smoothly to the local guide for the attraction, was handled smoothly and professionally.

The only flaw, which however I noticed affectcted essentially every other merchant in Krakow is that they ignored my explicit request to have a CC charge processed in PLN and converted it instead to $ (naturally at a really poor exchange rate, especially since my CC does not tag on a 3% added fee)). I stayed in Krakow too little to refine a technique to fight that scheme, but in the future I would refuse to hand out the card until they showed me on the screen of the card reading machine that there is no conversion.",July 2018,Cracow City Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274772-d1638523-Reviews-Cracow_City_Tours-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Really tasty food,"I went for the goose (no matter their name, their menu lists goose, not gosling) and was not disappointed. It starts with a complimentary serving of goose fat+minced goose meat to spread on toast. They I ordered pierogi with goose meat. They were excellent, but a warning: this is not a first dish as I wrongly thought, but a large portion that could be on its own a light main course. And then a really delicious goose leg. It came with 3 side dishes, which is notable because in some other restaurants I went to one has to order separately the side dishes. This makes a sizeable difference when you compare prices! I had to pass of course on the dessert. They did not have mead, but proposed instead a vodka laced with honey which was new for me and I found both interesting and tasty.
The ambiance is a bit rustic (table without white cloth and tables) but goes very well with traditional food. It is out of the main tourist beat, which for me was a plus. Excellent friendly service. The price was not really low, but locals tell me that all prices have gone up a lot in Krakow.
I recommend it.",July 2018,Kuchnia Polska Gaska,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274772-d11909192-Reviews-Kuchnia_Polska_Gaska-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good traditional restaurant,"I went mainly because I was curious about the pork knuckle dish. As they write in the menu, it is huge (> 1lb) and it could easily be shared among two, although the side dish part is skimpy even for one. It is very good, but one should be careful of removing a huge layer of white fat attached to the (delicious and crispy) skin. And even with some skillful ""surgery"" this remains a fairly fat meal. I liked also the pierogi.
I was told that good traditional restaurants should have on their list polish mead, which is (or perhaps was...) the traditional drink. Old Town was the only restaurant(out of 4) that actually had the mead, which they served hot as is tradition, and it was very good. The price was moderate, a tad below some other restaurants in the old town. One has to take into account that the huge tourism influx has inflated prices over the last few years.",July 2018,Old Town Restaurant Wine & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274772-d8412137-Reviews-Old_Town_Restaurant_Wine_Bar-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Must walk though it at least once,"The square is a must see because of its historical and cultural significance. Still, it is not ""beautiful"" - and how could even the most beautiful place on earth (and this is not) remain so when filled by tourists, tables, etc? But it is well worth a visit also for the various buildings in or around it.

Did not like the boar,"I wanted to stick to traditional Polish cusine but did not have much luck with the boar. It was tender, but its taste, if any, was overpowered by the preparation - a sort of sauer braten, I don't know if it was the fault of the cook or of the recipe (normal, I can't love all local foods, and until I try them I will not know).

Really good and strange restaurant,"Hard to find is an understatement. No street signs. I went through the gate, turned the only direction possible and was stopped by a glass door and was stopped by a glass door with a strip pasted on with an arrow pointing right. But right there was a nondescript door with no signage that definitely looked as a private house. No door bells. I tried the handle and it did open. But when I stepped in and said loudly ""Hello"" no one answered and it looked in all as a private abode. I stepped out in a hurry. There are places where they would shoot you for less invasive trespassing than that. I was standing outside pondering what to do when the glass door opened and the lady behind it clearly indicated the ""private"" door. So back in I went and through a hallway I got into a room with a few tables. Encouraging. One or two room further, someone who could have been a waitress greeted me in Romanian, but easily switched to English. The place did not look as any restaurant I have visited before but like a private home with a lot of large tables and very pretty and unusual decoration.
The menu had even English translations, and as mentioned on TripAdvisor had a lot of vegeterian fare. I started with a cheese fondue. It was pretty good, although it came with tiny tomatoes that did not really go well with the fondue. The main dish I chose was better: pork with mushrooms. Although the pork was a little bit too cooked for my taste, the mushrooms were delicious. To conclude, I had the lava cake which on second thought I should have avoided since my meal had been already rich enough. I ordered also a non descript artisan beer, not bad but I had better last night and they brought me
a complimentary Palinka to start the meal.
All in all a good choice, and very reasonably priced.",July 2018,Homemade Restaurant & More,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298478-d9789721-Reviews-Homemade_Restaurant_More-Timisoara_Timis_County_Western_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Timisoara, Romania",restaurants,4.0,4.5
OK restaurant,"I ordered a ""first course"" of tuna tartar. They don't have a separate list of appetizers, and indeed they do well not to call it an appetizer as the portion is quite large and could serve as a main course for a moderate appetite if it did come with some side dishes. It was good but not exceptional.
Then I ordered a duck leg. The dish was garnished artfully but it was much prettier than tasteful: the duck was good although some of it was a bit dry and the taste was on the bland side.
I was not impressed by the wine (Romanian) of which I ordered a glass. Fortunately before pouring the one I had ordered, they made me taste it. I seldom send back wines, but this was way too acidic. So they brought me another bottle to taste, which was just OK, but they did not tell me it sold for twice as much as the first one.
Apart from that the service was very attentive and the table at the road side was pleasurable.
I don't have yet sufficient terms of comparison with other Romanian restaurants, but I wonder if an all inclusive price-tag of $35 for one person with first and second dish, one glass of whine and two small bottles for water really qualifies as ""moderate"".
All in all, OK experience, but I am not eager to go back",July 2018,Vinto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298478-d12219901-Reviews-Vinto-Timisoara_Timis_County_Western_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Timisoara, Romania",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Somewhat disappointed,"First of all, I had a hard time finding the restaurant. In part my fault for not writing down the street number, but I thought that on a short street it would not be necessary. WRONG: no signs outside and only peeking through the open door one can see an umbrella in the garden with a beer sign. Are street signs so expensive? I got in and there is no one to direct me to a table. Someone from a window spots me, a few shouts and soon I am seated.
I ordered two dishes that had gotten praise by the reviewers but was underwhelmed. The pork neck came covered by a thick layer of melted cheese. I may be wrong, but that did not seem to me a traditional Romanian recipe. Also, in my taste the flavors did not combine very well. And the some of the pork (the part less protected by the cheese) was a bit dry.
I had also read about the papanasi (pronounced with a soft ""s"", as ""sh""). They were two sweet doughnuts (for lack of a better term) smothered by a nice sweet sauce, which I liked. But part of the doughnuts were soft and part were crisp (from the frying). Was that intentional or did the cook burn parts of the papanasi? In any case, I found both the softer and the firmer parts acceptable but not much more than that.
The craft beer produced locally was good.
The price was very reasonable and apart from the ""no greeting"" at the beginning, the service was good.

One of the worst hotels ever,"Main problem: my room was not serviced. I complained. They (falsely) claimed I had left out a ""do not disturb sign"", but another guest was in line to lodge the same complain and they had to shut up. Basically the receptionist just shrugged and did not even try to apologize or make amends. In case the maid was afraid seeing a dog crate in the room, I assure them that I and my dog would be gone the whole of the following day. Still no service the next day either. This time there was a line of 4-5 irate guests with all kinds of different complaints.

Other main problems: the telephone was disconnected, the coffee machine was missing the filter basket, the basin was missing the plug, the security latch was ripped from the door, the ""do not disturb sign"" was missing, an overload protector for the microwave was malfunctioning and emitting a disturbing noise every minute or so.

Minor problems: stains on the carpet, ugly furniture and in poor condition, rusty metal container for facial tissue, peeling paint on outside corridors, a puddle from a leak in the laundry room blocking the stairs, a big hole in the dog walk area (a real hazard at night), a depressing breakfast corner set in a corner of huge empty and disadorned dinner hall reminiscent of better times and with an old sofa with a ripped bottom. Stern signs warning clients how much they'd be charged for stealing room furnishing and warning not to remove food from the breakfast area seem to indicate the type of clients patronizing this hotel (which makes the missing security latch more worrisome).

The minor problems might be tolerable if unpleasant given the low price, but the lack of service and the run-down level of the rooms is plainly not acceptable.",March 2017,Ramada by Wyndham & Suites Warner Robins,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35348-d223344-Reviews-Ramada_by_Wyndham_Suites_Warner_Robins-Warner_Robins_Georgia.html,"Warner Robins, Georgia",hotels,1.0,2.5
Very nice and conveniently located,"I chose it because my flight was leaving early and Villa ai Tigli is close to the airport and offers a shuttle at any hour. It is easy to reach Venice by bus: very inexpensive, frequent connections. Just make sure to ask the owner, Eliana for a bus ticket for the times (or Sundays) when the Bar e Tabacchi that sells them is closed. The Villa was a pleasant surprise: a nice room with everything I needed. Eliana has been extremely helpful and efficient. She helped me organize my short visit to Venice and book some tours.

"Fairly good hotel, a bit pricey","The hotel is OK, fine furnishing, fairly large rooms.
