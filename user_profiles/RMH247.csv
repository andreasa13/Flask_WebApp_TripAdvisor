Very well done,"I went here many years ago and they've certainly upped their game for the tourists! The displays are superb and informative, the lay out and way to walk around the complex easy to follow and they are magnificent testimony to Roman ingenuity as many of their drains are in use and working today. The audio devices (included in the ticket price) are extremely comprehensive in their descriptions. A family ticket for 2 adults and 2 children is around £43 and allow around 2-3 hours to explore.

Absolutely delicious,"We loved this shop - free tastings are available and it is absolutely THE best cheddar we have ever tasted. A large round, around 600grams will set you back £16.99, but so worth it.

Something for everyone,"These caves have really been marketed up heaps since I was last here. The tickets you purchase gets you into the whole complex: Gough's Cave, Dreamhunters Cox cave, the prehistory Museum and Jacobs Ladder. The Dreamhunters cave has a display every half hour on the hour and half hour mark. To be honest, this was the least enjoyable of the gorge experience. Flashy lights and a whole lot of nothing....Gough's Cave, however runs you through the history of the place and since we went around Christmas, has loads of Christmas displays throughout the cave. The prehistory museum was pretty brief, but covered most aspects of humanity from Cheddar Man's time (approx 10000 years ago). Jacobs ladder is accessed as you exit Cox's cave and at the top of the 274 steps you can elect to climb the tower with awesome views of the area and then do a walk across the gorge (allow 2 hours). You'll need to allow a full day if you want to experience everything. Parking is a premium and costs everywhere you go (around £5) while entry for a family (2 adults, 2 children) is around £60 and includes entry to all I've mentioned.",November 2019,Cheddar Gorge & Caves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186371-d212457-Reviews-Cheddar_Gorge_Caves-Cheddar_Somerset_England.html,"Cheddar, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.0
Worst service and coffee EVER,"We thought it hard pressed to get a poor coffee anywhere in Italy, but this place wins hands down. The service is shocking and staff are rude. We ordered 2 capuccino and they were COLD. When we took them back it was like WE were the rude ones. They simply reheated the ones the made and flung them across the counter at us.

Best food in Italy!!,"Okay, best food in Italy may be a slight overstatement, but the food is superb. It's rolls with filling of your choice and it's FRESH and FLAVOURFUL.

One incredible view,Get there early or go there late for best photo opportunities. Crowds are often huge. Entrance to the Basilica is to the right hand side and free to see.

Magnificent,There's not much that I can add to the thousand of reviews. This is singularly spectacular. The Sistene Chapel is down a couple of rows of stairs and is a quiet and reflective zone. There are actually bench seats provided along the sides of the chapel where you may sit and reflect on the magnificent artworks from Michaelangelo.

Catholic church at its most decadent,"This Basilica is both impressive and a bit sickening, exemplifying the hypocritical nature and incredible wealth and power of the Catholic church. The Basilica is HUGE and has dedicated prayer sections, but also manages to have a few areas whereby you need to pay to see (including the museum within the basilica...) Outside the Basilica, not more than 50-100m and on the path to the Vatican museum,you can find, any given day, beggars, many of whom are amputees. The Basilica itself is free, so don't be scammed by all the ticket sellers lurking, offering 'cheap' tickets to get inside the Basilica and queue jump - there is no such thing.",November 2019,St. Peter's Basilica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187793-d631111-Reviews-St_Peter_s_Basilica-Vatican_City_Lazio.html,"Vatican City, Italy",attractions,3.0,5.0
Incredible collection,"The Vatican museum and Sistene Chapel is definitely something to see when in Rome if you can afford it. For Aussie or kiwi travellers book in your overtime because it's 17 euro to just get in. The collection of art is extensive, though, and they boast a huge Egyptian and Greek collection pilfered centuries ago, including a real mummy!! The art by Michaelangelo (Sistene Chapel)and other artists of the era are spectacular and well worth seeing though you're not allowed to photograph in the Sistene Chapel.

Utterly superb,"Do not miss this after you see the Colosseum - it's included in the ticket price. From Nero to Augustus, Romulus' and Caesar, this ruin covers everything. Allow yourself 3 hours at least to explore this ancient wonder and wear super comfortable shoes....the cobblestones are a killer after a long day! Be sure to check out the views from the palace and Nero's vineyard as the latter provides great photo opportunity of the Colosseum. You can just imagine how grandiose the whole scene would have been a couple of thousand years ago! Be aware, if you want to do the museum there or the palace tunnel, there are significant additional costs. 6 euro each for the museum and the same for the tunnel, which can add up for a family, making the initial ticket price almost 30 euro.

A must,"If you're in Rome, the Colosseum is a must! Tickets are 16euro which includes entry to the forum. The history of the colosseum is rich and interesting - even it's name was not meant to be the Colosseum, named Amphitheatre Flavium originally, but because it was located near a statue of a colossus...the nickname stuck. Beware of rip off merchant's promising you queue jumps and the like. Tour guides also promise a full tour of all 3 sites around the Colosseum, but take your money and only pay for a group pass to the Colosseum,doing a runner at the end, so make sure if you book a tour, to be sure your ticket covers the forum too. There are men walking up and down the queues selling water and souvenirs at extremely inflated prices so beware. As well, scammers thrust bracelets and other bits of rubbish at you and then demand money. Do not stop for these people. Lastly, if you don't want to wait hours and hours in frustration in the entry queues, book your tickets in advance. When numbers in the colosseum reach 3000, the entry of further tourists comes to a virtual stand still.

Great to experience,"We decided this would be be the perfect wet day activity. If you're staying anywhere near the train station, it's only a short walk, approximately 1km to Napoli Sotterranea. English speaking tours are conducted every hour on the hour and groups are taken in groups of about 60-65. The tour costs 10euro and lasts for 1.5 hours exactly. Be aware the front of house people taking payment are rude and angry, getting short and annoyed with tourists who are expected to queue in a tiny, stuffy area which would comfortably accommodate 20 people, NOT 60. The rules change depending upon which minute you show up. Pre-payment required prior to the tour, next minute, pay as you begin....who knows. The tour guides are nicer than the front of house people and somewhat knowledgeable on the topic they're presenting, though know very little actual fact about Italy's role in WWII and their allegiance to Germany and swapping to the allied forces side! The underground tour was interesting in that it was Greek ingenuity that saw 400km of aquaduct constructed to supply hundreds of thousands of Italians with potable water. The tour includes a walk through very narrow aquaduct tunnels so I don't recommend this if you're claustrophobic and obviously, no bulky bags or backpacks.Naturally, in Italy, there are many, many stairs to climb, so wear comfortable shoes. It gets very hot and stuffy down there, so wear layers that you can easily take off. The tour also incorporates a 30 second church walk through with zero explanation (why even bother?) and the Roman theatre that has been built over with 40 odd houses, but discovered 8 years ago and partially excavated those areas accessible or bought off residents. They rush people through and often several groups end up in the same place making it impossible to hear the information given by your guide. The whole process is executed poorly and it feels like they just want your money and care little about your experience. However, it's a worthwhile diversion and history lesson if you don't mind the utterly rude staff who seem like they'd rather be anywhere than where they are.",November 2019,Underground Naples,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187785-d2466778-Reviews-Underground_Naples-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",attractions,3.0,4.5

Breakfast was included which was incredible with a massive selection of foods it kick started our days beautifully. Our room, while small, was spotlessly clean. There is also a key lockable safe box in the rooms. There is no elevator so bring your muscles to lug your cases up the steps if you're an international traveller.

Escape the crowds,"After spending 2 days in the total hustle and bustle of Venice tourist hotspots, it was a refreshing relief to escape to the Ghetto. Most locals live around here and this is evidenced by the markedly cheaper shops and restaurants. We ate one of our best meals along a canal and it cost 17 euro for both of us!!

Wealth of the Catholic Church at its finest,"I will never forget the first time I went here many years ago. Staff were hitting beggars with sticks to get off the Basilica steps. There are no beggars in sight today. The Basilica has limited opening hours and all photos and video are strictly forbidden and the staff take their jobs VERY seriously so don't think you can sneak one undetected! Saturday's they close at 1pm and reopen around 2.30pm for a very limited time, but are not open to the public at all on Sundays. The Basilica roof is multi-domed and utterly magnificent. The acoustics are also something to hear! Right on one side of the San Marco square and in front of Doges Palace, it's hard to miss!

A great photo op,"Another freebie if you're willing to leg it.

A must see in Venice,"Of course you must visit San Marco! If you go early morning, take gum boots because the whole square gets flooded and access is only via planks which get very congested and move slowly. The water clears around 11-12midday. This also houses the very ritzy shopping precinct. Be aware that if you sit anywhere around the square for any form of refreshment or food, you will pay an absolute premium.

Great photo opportunities abound as it is one of the few things in Venice that costs nothing!

Do not miss,"Doges Palace is just behind St Mark's Basilica and if you have limited time, definitely put this on your must do list. With a rich history and a comprehensive artwork collection this is a superb experience for Venice. Cost is 25 euro per adult, and while expensive for those on a budget, I'd rather do this over any of the other things in Venice. The palace saw justice administration and senators wrote much of the law at the time. They claim to have very little trouble from the 13th century forward, but their extensive prison attached and their impressive execution rate, one would question their claims! The prison attached is included in the ticket price and is a sombre place indeed. As you go through look for the 'Bridge of Sighs,' so named because prisoners to be executed caught their last glimpse of Venice and sighed at the sight, on their way to their deaths. The artwork contained here is superb and the justice rooms are ornate, to say the least, built on the back of the massive silver resources of the time. The entire visit, if you read the exhibits and artwork would easily take 5 hours. There is lots of stair climbing and walking, so wear very comfortable shoes. There are very few places to sit and staff can be over the top and quite rude if you get too close to read the exhibits (one older woman was scolded for doing nothing wrong, but leaning in to read a description - the staff are very rude, proprietary and ungracious, especially considering they're at a major tourist Mecca and they hover, untrusting, around the entire palace in swarm numbers).

The displays are fantastic and the dioramas comprehensive of the area and its development which is visually chronicled from 500BC. You're your own boss as you wander around this ruin, so a guide book may help, although upon entry, you're given a numbered map to help orient yourself and understand the layout of the ancient community.

Majestic,"The Acropolis still sits majestically above Athens. If you want to see this with minimal traffic, do so early in the morning. We arrived around 8.45am and there was very few out and about at this time. Tickets just for the Acropolis are 10euro and they do not accept non EU students despite having a student card. This does NOT include entry to the museum. The sites remain unchanged with workmen everywhere and many areas cordoned off. The scaffolding is still everywhere and it remains unchanged over 25 years of visiting this site (do the restorations already guys) and makes photography sans scaffolding difficult. Very important women watch with eagle eyes over the rope boundaries, blowing whistles with glee if a hapless tourist wanders off a designated path. Make sure you see everything because if you exit the Acropolis you cannot use your ticket again and must buy another. The walk around the mountain is well worth it, with hidden gems signposted showing glimpses of the past magnificence this bustling acropolis was.

Poor at best,"We decided to take this option to visit Delphi. First off, they do not accept students, with a valid student card, from anywhere but Greece,so any visiting students be prepared to pay adult fares. The bus, return, very expensive at 65.60euro for two. We were given our tickets with no instruction and the departure terminal was not on our tickets. After finding our terminal, we boarded the bus. It was filthy with smeared, greasy windows and rubbish jammed into the seat bins. The bus was late departing. The return trip was worse with the bus arriving 20min late for pick up at Delphi. The bus driver had the heater on for a 23deg day causing several customers to ask him to turn it off, to no avail. Everyone had to take off max amount of clothing and were sweating and almost passing out as temperatures in the bus got to near 40deg Celcius.

Spectacular Scenery,"Delphi is the place of the oracles where mortals would complete their odyssey to seek the wisdom from those oracle's at Delphi. It's pretty easy to get there and is roughly a 2 hour drive from Athens. Our suggestion is to avoid the bus at all costs and hire a car and drive yourself. There are 2 tolls for a car that total $5euro at our time of travel. The drive is easy (once you're out of the city) and clearly sign posted. Entry to Delphi ruins is 6euro, but they do not accept students from other countries so be prepared to pay adult prices for your students. The site has been modernised since I was last there and access to the stadium severely restricted so that you can only see it from a roped off distance which was disappointing for me (who had wandered intimately through the ruins (without touching or destroying) but somewhat understandable.) The Delphi museum adjacent to the ruins is absolutely fantastic and your ticket price covers entry here. This museum is even better than the Acropolis museum. After you see all this, head 800m down the hill and visit the temple of Athena which is absolutely superb. You can wander around the ruins intimately and they have been spectacularly and tastefully restored.

Great Value for all,"We stayed here over the Australia Day long weekend and while all the other businesses were madly fleecing all the tourists an extra 15% on top of already expensive prices, the Girls at By the Sea were offering free DVD hire, all free equipment hire (and the range is extensive: bikes, laptops, eski's, umbrellas, gym equipment etc), free ice and the list goes on. The staff were friendly and patient, professional and accommodating. It was our anniversary, so we were given a lovely, congratulatory card and a bottle of champagne on arrival. The room we were allocated from our online booking was not reflected in any of the pictures on the website, but we're not really fussy - as long as we have somewhere to sleep. The room was, however, very clean and well equipped. Parking was quite a nightmare because there just wasn't enough spaces and the fit was very tight, even for our tiny hire car. I can't speak for all the rooms, but they were not sound proofed very well - we could easily hear conversation from the room next door and lots of back ground noise, making it hard to sleep at times and, of course, being woken very early. I wouldn't, however, hesitate to recommend this place, purely on the basis of location (walking distance to the main hub of Port Douglas) and the incredible staff employed here.",January 2018,By The Sea Port Douglas Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255070-d285599-Reviews-By_The_Sea_Port_Douglas_Resort-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html,"Port Douglas, Australia",hotels,4.0,5.0
Great sized meals,"We ordered the barramundi and a grilled chicken burger. The barra came with chips and a basic salad, but the star of the dish was the amazing tartare sauce! The chicken burger was pretty big and also came with chips - ok, but chips were skinny and too overcooked (but they were pretty busy). We also ordered a steamed vegetable side and these were superb. We had two beers with our meal and the whole lot was $55, so pretty good value since we left feeling full and satisfied.

Choose this company for your Daintree cruise!,"First up, i accidentally booked the wrong date and rang the company at 7pm. I could NOT believe it when the owner, Bruce, answered. I explained my mistake and he changed us across to our preferred date, no hassles. Now, we wanted to take a cruise down the Daintree in the hope of being lucky enough to see a few crocs. We understand that crocs don't appear because people want them to, and considering the time of year, we weren't holding our breath. But, we were very lucky and managed to see several - ranging from hatchling to adult. Our guide, Jayden, was knowledgeable about the area; crocs and the flora of the Daintree and skilled at manoeuvring the boat around so all could see from a good vantage point. Back in the shop, Ray was absolutely awesome - we stayed and had a great chat and he helped us with his knowledge of things to do heading up to Cape Tribulation. We honestly cannot fault this family run tour operation and the staff were simply amazing.

"Gorgeous...and yes, you can walk in.","We read loads of reviews about this because we weren't sure if we could walk to the gorge from the visitor centre. While walking in is discouraged by the visitor centre and the bus operators (!) the walk is very doable and easy. It's approx 2km to the gorge boardwalk, so would take around 15min for those of average fitness (lots and lots of people do walk it). The road does narrow in some spots, but no traffic apart from the tour buses have access, so they're easy to hear and avoid! Once there, the gorge walk is absolutely fabulous (wear suitable footwear - there's some steep and slippery sections). If you're travelling during the very humid season, pack your bathers because there's some gorgeous swimming spots where many go in for a refreshing dip! This was one of our highlights for this area! Allow yourself at least 4 hours to enjoy this spot!",January 2018,Mossman Gorge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2502167-d1020071-Reviews-Mossman_Gorge-Daintree_Region_Queensland.html,"Daintree Region, Australia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Pretty spot and lovely staff,"We thought we could choose our ice cream flavours here, but we understand that, more often or not, you can't. When we arrived, we were presented with the 4 flavours (tiny scoops in one small cup for 7.50AUD), but we didn't eat two of the flavours and weren't familiar with the other 2. Luckily for us, the staff member was very accommodating and gave us some substitute flavours.

Very ordinary,"If you like value for money and a decent sized serve, we'd recommend giving this place a miss. Rice is served in such small bowls and at 3.50 per serve is ludicrously poor value on top of more expensive- than -usual for basic Thai mains. The majority of their staff have little to no English Skills so ordering is done via pointing and gesturing.

Shocking value for lots of money,"We visited here in a big group and ordered our food. A couple of us ordered a salad. Well, despite the ridiculous cost, you wouldn't mind so much if you were served something more than a small entree size meal. However, we weren't. The value for about 4 forks full of salad was atrocious. Luckily there's a hungry Jack's straight outside so you can actually get a filling meal that won't break the bank.

Best pies ever,"My son and I detoured here for lunch upon a recommendation and we were so happy we did. The pies are homemade and they have a huge variety. The steak is chunky and very lean (no horrid blobs of fat or gristle) and the pastry is perfect. They also supply a variety of vegetarian - the penang curry pumpkin pie was delicious.

Fun way to learn about Seattle's waterfront past!,"We were interested to try this experience and weren't disappointed. There aren't a huge amount of underground stops because the company is reliant on businesses allowing the tour company access and only 3 or 4 have allowed it. Nevertheless, the tourguides make good use of what they have and entertain their groups with knowledgeable and entertaining tales of Seattle from yester year. Lasting about an hour and a half, explore parts of the waterfront in groups of about 25 or 30. Guide's are pretty chill and allow those of us wishing to hang back to get good photos before moving on. They're open until 7pm during peak times and 6pm others. Suitable for children from the age of about 8 up, otherwise they may get bored or frightened. We had a 13 year old with us who loved it! You don't have to pre book, as walk-ins are accommodated on a first served basis. All the guides we experienced were funny, articulate and very knowledgeable! Good way to spend some time exploring and learning. Kids are 13 and under, otherwise it's adult prices -27usd each.",June 2017,Bill Speidel's Underground Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60878-d1089321-Reviews-Bill_Speidel_s_Underground_Tour-Seattle_Washington.html,"Seattle, Washington",attractions,4.0,4.0
Alright for a short time,"We always visit the Pike Markets when in Seattle, but try to limit our time here. Each year it seems to expand, but there's the usual vendors: food, flowers, seafood, souvenirs and small independent businesses cashing in on the tourists! Colourful and pungent, Pike Markets don't disappoint. We always visit the thrift shop right up the end and always leave with some incredibly good value stuff. This store is the hidden gem of the Pike market! There's a nice outside spot where you can eat the food and drinks you cannot resist from the market with nice views, especially when the sun is out!

An Italian restaurant that can really cook amazing pasta!,"This restaurant, I have learned, has been in business since the 1950's and it's easy to understand why. The food from entree, to salads, mains and dessert is incredible. The flavours are without par and they service is exceptional. Best of all, their pasta is cooked to el dente perfection. Even their bloody Mary's pack incredible punch and flavour. If you're ever in this neck of the woods, do yourself a favour and do not miss this place.

We were greeted by an incredibly accommodating concierge, Brandon, who showed us to our table. Our serving person was Latoya and she was amazing; friendly, bubbly, funny and pre-emptive to our needs. So we have the staff covered and cannot fault them. We all ordered a burger and got bottomless sweet potato fries. Our food was delivered so quickly and was incredibly fresh and tasty. All in my travelling party agreed that we had not had a better meal. When Brandon clocked out, he joined us at our table and we all had a great night of laughter and fun.

"Good, but way too expensive for what you get","We decided this would be our activity of choice in Skaguay, Alaska. We had to arrive at the train station in Skaguay 15min, or so, prior to departure. This we did, with the expected 12.45pm departure. However, we didn't leave until 1.05pm and since this is advertised as a 3 hour round trip, we were a bit disappointed that we were only on the trip for 2.5hours. The scenery, however, was gorgeous with snow capped peaks etc and the periodic commentary of Annie, the train your guide, was informative and interesting. The frustrating thing was the obvious cash grab of kitsch souvenirs whilst on the train (cap, DVD and 'bonus' magazine for usd20) which we found pretty bad since we'd already paid usd122 for this rail tour. So I'm sorry to say that while it was Good, it wasn't great and most certainly not worth the small fortune we forked out for the pleasure in our party of 12. Too late we learned that you can get a bus tour that offers the same route, PLUS, more for $35.

They (alomg with many other wineries in this area) charge a 'tasting' fee of $5, and the price of their wines compared to other wineries in the area are, frankly, laughable.

Just comfortable,"Aside from being clean, this hotel is in need of major renovation. The carpet is unsecured leading from the bathroom to the room and a trip hazard. The bathrooms are tiny that you can barely manoeuvre around the toilet into the shower with the basin outside leaving no privacy for brushing teeth or anything.

Great spot,"We were here overnight, but the hotel clean, beds were very comfortable and, like the name says, is a gateway into Vancouver. There's a courtesy bus that runs to and from the airport every 20 minutes. From the airport you can catch the train (buy an all day transport card for 10.75 at the hotel shop) and if you get off at Watergate station, its either a 20min walk to Stanley Park. Alternatively, you can catch the number 19 bus there. Plus, the outlet shops are only a 10min walk from the hotel or a few stops on the train. Of course, you need loads of time to fully explore Vancouver, but this a great day trip if you have limited time, or are on a tour. Breakfast is provided for those who choose and it's a full one with plenty of hot and cold food options.

There's the zip line and the nightly LED screen lighting up the whole of Freemont street with a sensational music and light extravaganza! At one end, you have The Heart Attack grill where if you're over 350 pounds you eat free!!

The staff were lovely!,"As a couple who have travelled extensively, we were underwhelmed by the Naviti. This is definitely no 4 star resort. In saying that, however, the grounds immediately around the resort were immaculately kept and the staff were lovely. If you intend to go, pack all your essentials like sunscreen, hats and repellent because the shop in room 101 is extortionate with a bottle of water at $9! Supermarkets are plentiful and in Sigatoka we stocked up on water for 90cents for 1.5L bottles. We found the restaurants poor value for the prices they charged - categorically NOT on par with Australia, despite protestation of the Naviti gen mgr - and we were not told that there would be 3 additional taxes applied to everything upon checkout, including their new environmental levy. Rooms were very old and run down and basic patch up jobs evident. We can appreciate the location and how everything is on 'Fiji' time, but if you do want that touch of luxury and comfort, consider staying elsewhere. This seemed to be the consensus of other guests we spoke to whilst at the Naviti.

The half dome can be hiked, but you have to apply for a ballot. We, unfortunately, we're not successful this time.
