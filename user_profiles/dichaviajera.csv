Still under renovations but worthy to see from the outside,"Keep in mind you are not allowed to enter inside and that you will not find any sculptures.

A must see if you go to Athens. I had the privilege to see the sunrise from there!,"If you love Ancient history and art, even when they are still restoring the area and you have to use your imagination really hard (as mostly you will find no sculptures or details), just the feeling of being in such an iconic place and the beautiful views of the huge city of Athens and its surroundings that you have from there, make it worthy. Go early in the morning to avoid lines and groups!",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

The best way to really understand and feel the vibe of Athens. Totally worthy!,"Katherina is a very knowledgeable guide; kind, caring, informative, flexible. She shared me a lot of interesting facts about the history of Athens and how the city and Greece developed, specially from the mid XIX and the XXth centuries. She was so gentle to share me some advice about must see places to visit after our walking tour and where to eat for trying local typical food in a nice athmosphere. I highly recommend her; it's really value for money!",January 2020,Three hour tour to see the real Athens!
