Awesome!,"My daughter made us walk the streets of Kalamata to find this place, but boy was it worth it! We ordered hot and sour soup (amazing), chicken gyoza’s a delight and the various sushi dishes were fresh and delicious! Highly recommended!",August 2018,Umami Sushi and More,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g668020-d11748685-Reviews-Umami_Sushi_and_More-Kalamata_Messenia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Kalamata, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fabulous Sunset location,Set on a west facing hill with sensational views across Messenia bay and Kalamata. The perfect location for late dinner or sundowners! The sunsets are incredible. The menu is limited but the food is good as was the service. A haven for cat lovers as there are a number of strays that make this place home. A little busy so recommend you book a table if you wish to eat in the restaurant.,August 2018,Kastraki - Meteoro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g668020-d6696826-Reviews-Kastraki_Meteoro-Kalamata_Messenia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Kalamata, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Clean and warm,"The beach stretches around the bay and is shallow in terms of beach space. Despite this there is plenty of space and serviced by beach side tavernas, some with loungers. The sand is gravely in places with sand towards the harbour end. The sea is clean calm and warm. Perfect for small children.",August 2018,Kalamata Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g668020-d8862919-Reviews-Kalamata_Beach-Kalamata_Messenia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Kalamata, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great atmosphere and service,We popped in here as we explored the city centre and was very impressed with the atmosphere food and service. Highly recommended.,August 2018,Luna Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g668020-d2716167-Reviews-Luna_Lounge-Kalamata_Messenia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Kalamata, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Lunch on the Beach,Fabulous location on the beach; the food and service doesn’t disappoint. The waiter was wonderfully attentive and spoke excellent English. We ordered a number of dishes including the sardines. All of which were fabulous! I would recommend the meatballs - delicious!,August 2018,Sef,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g668020-d8553204-Reviews-Sef-Kalamata_Messenia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Kalamata, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Paradise Lost,"Quite literally!

The beach and location is idyllic but totally ruined by humans who have no respect for the environment. The car park and approach road was strewn with little and the sand dunes used as a toilet!

We drove hours to get to this famous beauty spot, famed as being one of the best beaches in Greece, alas a sad and disappointing trip.",August 2018,Voidokilia Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g10137450-d2663285-Reviews-Voidokilia_Beach-Petrochori_Pylos_Nestor_Messenia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Petrochori, Greece",attractions,1.0,4.5
Fabulous first night it Athens,"Amazing service and super friendly team. Real family feel to this place. They went out of their way to give us a true Greek experience with food recommendations and shots of the Greek liquors!
Wonderful location opposite the Acropolis Museum on cobblestone street.",August 2018,Elaea Mezedadiko,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10587843-Reviews-Elaea_Mezedadiko-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Awesome,Incredible experience. Walking over the footprint of the ancient city! Amazing artefacts and stone carvings.

Breathtaking!,"Truly a remarkable monument of a lost era when they build structures to last millenniums! The views from the Acropolis are breathtaking! I would recommend wearing trainers with grip, as the marble floors are very slippery and the ground surface uneven in places.",August 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Awesome views over Athens,The highest point in Athens (277 meters) the 360 degree views are amazing! There’s an amazing little church at top and a great watering hole! It’s the worth the climb (if you choose to walk) but if you can’t there is a cable car!,August 2018,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fabulous,"I booked the night at this hotel as my daughter and I were attending a concert at the O2. We arrived early for some spa treatments and were greeted by Thabo who was wonderfully helpful and assisted our early check-in, as requested. The room was fantastic, spotlessly clean and had great views from 10th floor.

Maggie provided the best Hot Stones massage I’ve ever had and ironed away all my knots and tension!

The food and service by Sara at the Sky bar on 18th floor was wonderful, but we arrived as it opened. It was soon very busy and people were queuing to get in when we left for the concert.

It was very busy after the concert as you can imagine everyone arriving back at the same time but the staff in the 1st floor bar did well to serve the thirsty residents as efficiently as they could.

I would have just one suggestion for the management to consider - open the ground floor lounge to allow guests to enjoy the space with drinks as both bars were exceptionally busy?

All in all it was a great stay and wouldn’t hesitate to return.",April 2018,InterContinental London - The O2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d8147345-Reviews-InterContinental_London_The_O2-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
