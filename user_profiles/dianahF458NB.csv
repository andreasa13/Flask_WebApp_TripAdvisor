Regina Mundi visit,"A rather large church

It is a very large Catholic church in Soweto. To me it had a very cold and eery feel to it especially if you know what went on in the past. Bullet holes in the glass stained windows are a strong reminder of the horrors of the day. The museum up the stairs was stark and i felt more could have been done to it. The church in essence in my opinion would not warrant a visit would it not have had the history behind it. I am glad i saw it this once.",March 2019,Regina Mundi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312587-d563950-Reviews-Regina_Mundi-Soweto_Johannesburg_Greater_Johannesburg_Gauteng.html,"Soweto, South Africa",attractions,3.0,4.0

Best steak in JHB; the Carvery is not bad either -:),A family restaurant of long long standing in the same location but different ownership.

El Greco Hotel - Chania Crete,"Having booked in the April and arriving in September we had hoped for a better so called 3* hotel.
We had a horrible room just off the reception area, no ventilation except for a noisy aircon. No view, no air and dark. The hotel has old and new rooms, it has a lift that only goes to the 3rd floor and houses 3 rooms. If you are not able to be assured (in writing) of getting those rooms i would not go back.
We had a cupboard with NO COMPARTMENTS ONLY HANGING SPACE and 7 bent and faded wire hangers. We had to ask for a plug for the sink, and after a shower the floor in the bathroom was slippery and dangerous.

On the plus side, the staff are very helpful, the location is amazing and the breakfast very generous (although the cold meat variety could have been more imaginative. same every day). Free internet PC available but no printer. However the hotel will print out for you any document you require. No satellite and only Greek programmes. There are other hotel nearby of similar or close to price level, and rooms to let, so one has to do some homework.
Would we go back to the hotel? only if assured of a room with a view and a lift.",September 2019,El Greco Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189415-d593312-Reviews-El_Greco_Hotel-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,3.0,3.5

Visiting Meteora by train..... not for the unfit or very elderly !,"The tour is a full and long day one. I recommend that only fit persons undertake this!. Four hours by train to the destination, about an hour by coach to get to the 1st Monastery, climb +- 350 metres uphill and stairs or even higher depending on the Monastery you visit. We did 2 in a day and it was hectic. Worthwhile and a once in a life time experience. 4 hours back to Athens ! Unbelievable views and a sense of achievement having done it.

FRIENDS GET TOGETHER AT CAFE DEL SOL BOTANICO,"I booked a table for 5. We had a nice spot and good service. However, the food although good and tasty was in my opinion not worth the expensive prices we paid !

A very expensive night out but worth it. We sat 4 rows from the front and the only criticism we had was that we would have liked a little more leg room. You can follow the Opera in the language of your choice on a pad in front of you. This made the Opera far more easy to follow and understand.

Never again on Iberia if we can help it................,"This is a good/bad and ugly story.
We had to fly Iberia as BA could not accommodate us on the assigned dates.
Their website to start with is not user friendly and eventually I gave up searching for on-board shopping in order to order on-line. We could not check in on- line in JHB or Milan.

Our aircrafts were all good and new, entertainment was easy to navigate and leg room
was good. That is the good news.

The food on board was indifferent as was the service. It would have been nice to see a smile every now and then. The breakfast (so called) was disgusting and cold; not even at room temperature.

The internal broadcasts in English were a blurr... heavy Spanish accents spoken so fast that no one could follow. To give some credit, we could understand the captains who spoke well and slowly; and the pre-recorded messages.


We flew Virgin Airlines to USA and UK in May/June 2017 and that was an experience to remember. We would rate them 4.5 out of 5.

The Hotel is modern and well situated. The room we had was a bit small but more than adequate and very clean. the staff everywhere were polite. One associates noise in NY City so although on the 19th floor we accepted the noise as part of the NY vibe.
Breakfast was a self-service canteen style set-up with a generous variety, so no complaints there.

would we stay again? Yes, definitely.
The only one big recommendation: TAKE AWAY THE IRONING BOARD AND IRON. NO ONE WANT TO IRON ON HOLIDAY. LET'S HAVE TEA AND COFFEE FACILITIES IN THE ROOM !!!!!!!!!!

This would have made us rate the hotel 5*.

Also a few more shelves in the cupboard would have been nice.

Col'Cacchio - El Corro Centre Northcliff,My husband (Italian) and myself decided to tried what we believed to be the recently opened restaurant. After experiencing Col'Cacchio in Bryantson - Nicole Way on a number of occasions I hope not to be disappointed. Sorry to say I was. The food looked very appetizing but the service let it down badly. The restaurant was 85% empty when we were there around 14h30 so there was no excuse for the slow service we received. I think it is a great Brand and one experience should not judge the Brand. they probably still have teething problems. We will try again before deciding to travel all the way to Bryanston instead of Northcliff.,April 2017,Col'Cacchio Willowbridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312656-d2628830-Reviews-Col_Cacchio_Willowbridge-Bellville_Western_Cape.html,"Bellville, South Africa",restaurants,3.0,4.0
AN AMAZING DAY WITH THE LIONS,"After living in Africa for many many years and having been on more safaris in kenya, Tanzania and SA we decided against all odds to go and spend 5-6 hours at the new lion park. It was amazing. the setting, vegetation, trained staff everywhere, signed so well you could not get lost were a real treat. We opted for a one hour trip to see lions and wild dogs and were not disappointed our guide had an incredible sense of humour and was very knowledgeable. We petted lion cubs who were 5 months old and totally oblivious to us being there, it was a hot day and it was their snooze time. We had pics taken like tourists, ordered 2 mugs, key rings and an A4 poster.
The park has fantastic shopping for tourist (or locals), very good food outlets, we had a superb steak and wine- well priced.
The experience is not cheap however, when one sees the upkeep and value for money we left feeling it was all worth it.
Highly recommended for a 5-6 hours trip.",March 2017,Lion and Safari Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1910063-d481147-Reviews-Lion_and_Safari_Park-Broederstroom_Madibeng_North_West_Province.html,"Broederstroom, South Africa",attractions,5.0,4.5
Superb location and excellent food marred by chaotic inexperienced staff from top down.,"The location and food were very well present and were of above high quality.

We arrived at 12h30, our table was booked for 13h00 and on booking it was indicated that this was a special occassion. First impression on entering the premises were wow, we made a good choice. We were greeted warmly and thereafter it was chaos! The staff were still sorting out tables and chairs, our table was not ready and we were pointed to some sofas until our table would eventually be set-up. This was approx. 20 minutes later -:( We were not able to have a drink as no table number was yet allocated to us; had to look for a waiter and eventually ordered the drinks and they were served at the small table under a beautiful tree. The bottle of wine was plonked on the table, my husband's beer left closed on the table, however, the best was yet to come. We were not asked to taste the wine as it was left unopened on the table for us to open and pour. The ice we requested did not arrive so we had to ask again by a passing waiter. The waiters were all very friendly but it appeared as as if in chaos!!!! We waited for some 20 minutes before our order was taken. The food arrived pretty quickly and was very tasty. So, all in all not a disappointing experience but with proper restaurant management and knowledge of the hospitality industry ; one could create this little haven to a place worth of a 5 rating. the ambiance ( live french music), setting and good food made up for the chaos that greeted.
Price of the main dishes a bit on the expensive side, however, worth it as the quality and quantity were good.
