Nice place for a drink while you watch the sunset,"Good, beachside bar which also offers some (limited) meal options.
The drinks were fine - including cocktails - and the location absolutely perfect for watching the sunset.
We had a meal once. it was OK - limited in scope but well cooked.",August 2020,aVentoura,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1184009-d12505475-Reviews-AVentoura-Galissas_Syros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Syros, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
OK,"A typical Greek restaurant. I thought it overpriced and the food mediocre, but my (Greek) wife though more highly of it. Worth a visit is you are staying in the village, but not a destination restaurant.",August 2020,Savvas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1184009-d3343367-Reviews-Savvas-Galissas_Syros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Syros, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Excellent - strongly recommend,"We went twice. Once for the fish soup and a HUGE pork steak - which we ended up sharing.
The other time, soup (is was that good), cod/garlic and prawns.
Everything was very well cooked and *really* tasty. I particularly liked the little bit of peppermint sauce with the soup.
I also strongly recommend the cheese loukomades and the Syros salad.
It gets very busy - even under Covid conditions - so you need to book.",August 2020,Iliovasilema,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1184009-d2194506-Reviews-Iliovasilema-Galissas_Syros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Syros, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Lovely, friendly hotel - very relaxing","Location: Just across the road (not busy) from the (good) beach, which has numerous umbrellas.
Staff: Unfailingly pleasant and helpful.
Room: We had a family room - two rooms lined by an open arch. One had 2 singles pushed together and the other had sofa bed - it also had the kitchenette and the bathroom. Both rooms comfortable and together were big enough for our 2-week stay. They had a common balcony which faced the swimming pool. The bathroom was big enough for our needs. The room had everything we needed.
The pool: Lovely. Deep (>2m) at one end and shallow at the other, with an 'attached' padding pool. While we were there the pool was never crowded and there ware always spare sunbeams around it - but not the date! Covid... We also enjoyed trying out the outdoor gym!
The food: Breakfast was excellent -'English' options as well as the usual continental/Greek specialities. Served under Covid restrictions on serving. Worth mentioning that the cook baked cakes/tarts for breakfast every day. V. Tasty!
For the rest of the day, the hotel served all the usual drinks -including pool-side delivery - and a small but very tasty selection of snacks and meals. We 'ate in' a couple of nights - pasta, burger, pizza - and had bruschetta and other snack some days.
Summary - a really relied, pleasant experience for a 2-week stay during 'Covid time', with everything we needed at hand. Everything cleaned/sterilised in line with government requirements. We will return.",August 2020,Hotel Benois,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1184009-d503454-Reviews-Hotel_Benois-Galissas_Syros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Syros, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Skip the line? More 'Wait in line'.,"We arrived 20 minutes before our tour started to be told (along with about 20 others) that, despite holding a confirmatory email with booking code, the firm had no record of our booking or our names.
After some 'discussion', we we're told they would 'try to fit us' into an existing group.
We were lucky (?) to be attached to a group, many others were still in the office when we left.
There was then a considerable wait outside the Vatican - some not the fault of the company as it was due to the number of groups visiting, but the wait was significantly exacerbated because our guide was not available.
Then she arrived, took us to a small square outside the body of the museum and lectured us for almost 45 minutes (I kid you not) about what we would see. It was now 1.5 hours into a nominal 3 hour tour and we have not even started visiting the first of the three sites were would visit. (Museum, Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's).
We then entered ta colonnade on the outside of the museum - and the guide disappeared.
Some time later she reappeared and then went rather quickly through the museum and (compared to the other groups that were in it when we arrived and still there when we left) *very* quickly through the Sistine Chapel. Clearly the guide thought it more important to tell us what was there than to let us see it.
We then had a brisk walk through St. Peters.

Amazing places. Guides so-so,"We did this tour on Halloween... The catacombs re unbelievable, and the crypts of the Capuchins are spooky beyond belief. The (very young) guides were so-so. They knew their script, but lacked the depth of knowledge that, say Milena had on our tour of the Palatine hill. But, given the nature of the places visited oaths tour, that was not really a problem.

Ask for Milena,"This was the best tour we have gone on. The guide, Milena was hugely knowledgeable and informative, making the walk a complete joy.
It is not cheap, but we learnt so much, and the guide communicated a great feeling of what it must have been like to be on the hill of in the Colosseum in Roman times.
The firm uses individual headsets, which (unlike those at the Vatican) work and allow: a) the guide to talk in a normal voice, b) everyone to hear to you do not need to cram close to her and c) stop those not on the tour butting in - a bonus for the guide company.",November 2019,"Skip the Line Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill Tour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187791-d11457881-Skip_the_Line_Colosseum_Roman_Forum_and_Palatine_Hill_Tour-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",activities,5.0,4.5
Great from the sea - appalling on the beach,"This beach is so full of sunbeds that it is really hard to walk between them - which also means that you have no view at all of the sea other than from the front rows. Massively over-exploited and crowded. Not fun at all.
However, once in the water there are delights. From about 100m out, the view back is amazing with the mountains rising high behind the beach. There are also (very) cold springs feeding into the beach from below and from the rocks at the side. This is wonderful - as you swim out, the water alternates in temperature between freezing and warm. There is a 'black hole' about 100m out, where the outpouring is partially covered by a rock - and for the kids there is a small, deep pool of unbelievably cold water in the rocks at the side of the beach.

Excellent basic restaurant,"This restaurant was next to our hotel, so we ate there two evenings. Good, straightforward Italian food. The staff are exceptionally friendly and welcoming, and were happy to adjust a dish to suit our daughter! Tasty, reasonably priced.

A change from the usual,"This restaurant is off the beaten track, but worth seeking out. Essentially it offered a set meal, warm salad and then a plate with a variety of cooked meats and vegetables. All were well-cooked and tasty.

Perfect for a quick gyros - but be prepared to queue,"This place provides first-class gyros and other grilled meat, either eat-in or takeaway - at a very good price.

Our 'go-to' restaurant,"We visited this for dinner four times during out two-week stay, sampling fish, sea-food, grilled meat, burgers(!) and oven-based Greek dishes. All are tasty and better than other restaurants along the sea-front. The prawns & calamari are especially recommended.
We also made almost daily use of the sun-beds belonging to the restaurant. Unlike many others on the beach, these have to be paid for, but for 4 Euro, you get a solid, wooden sun-bed with a think foam mattress. *Much* more comfortable than the camp-beds provided by other bars/restaurants.

Beautiful relaxing hotel!,"The two connected rooms were spacious and clean. There were two balconies - one facing the sea with a table and chairs, the other (smaller) one we used to dry clothes. The two single beds are in the same space as the kitchen and the other room had a double bed. The only drawbacks were: 1 You had to go through the room with the two single beds to reach the bathroom and 2. There was essentially no wifi in the room unless you were touching the balcony.
The shower had good power and the toiletries supplied were fine.
Breakfast was the usual Greek offering - cold meat, cheese, cereal and some hot items.
The pool depth varied from about 1m to 2.4m and rarely seemed crowded. The 'quiet time' from 2:30-5:30 was respected, but it did NOT mean that one could not use the pool. Like a number of other guests, my daughter and I spend much of this time sitting in the shade by the pool (good number of loungers and chairs) reading - and then just falling into the water occasionally to cool off. This experience was made much more pleasurable by the look of the place. Sitting by the pool, there were views of the sea to one side and looking back at the rooms, it was like being in a beautiful (if a little twee) village - see the photos on the website for details. The pool bar was a bonus, and the friendly and helpful staff were super.
We had a wonderfully relaxing time - had to drag ourselves away from the pool to the beach, even though it was only a very short walk away.

Lovely lunch,"Good food, open light spacious room and great service. I think that their idea of bringing the cold maze to the table on a tray was inspired - we chose stuff that we otherwise would not have tried and found it all delicious, especially the smoked mussels.

Basic. Clean but very 'tired'.,"Stayed here for one night, arriving after midnight and leaving 9:30 am. The room is very basic, and although it is clean, everything seems really tired and worn. Carpets show real signs of wear and the whole place is in need of complete refurbishment. Bears absolutely no comparison with, for example, a Premier Inn.

Great night's sleep - excellent value,"I booked this as I was arriving at Heathrow about 11pm. Although I arrived at T5, I chose this as it seemed closer to the airport, so easier to get to the tube the next day. Once I realised that the walkway to the hotel was from the *departures* level (not arrivals...) it only took a few minutes to arrive. typical Premier Inn hotel. large room (for 1) with all you need for a short stay - iron, tea/coffee, fridge etc. I slept really well - there was absolutely no noise from the airport or planes, and had a late, and large, English breakfast.

Superb food. Amazing quality - and quantity!,"I went with my family - 5 adults and 1 baby and we had the set menu 'B' for the whole tale. Two of the party are vegetarian and we told the staff this. The range of meze was incredible and every dish was rated 'excellent' by all who tasted it.

Cool place to stop after the climb.,"Lovely, restored church just inside the upper town in Monemvasia.

Wonderful spring morning climb.,"We went over the Easter weekend. The climb is *extremely* steep - and when you get to the fortress wall there is another significant climb to the Citadel - and it really made me wonder how an attacking force could overcome the wonderful natural defence. The view from the top is amazing, and in the spring the walls are covered in beautiful flowers of so many colours.
Climb in the morning - I really could not imagine taking this on during the heat of a summer noon! (Or when it is raining as the steps are very well-worn and so slippery.)
Within the fortress there are some really interesting ruins from the Venetian and Ottoman times and a vertigo-inducing look down to the lower town!",April 2019,Monemvasia Fortress,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g285708-d10368678-Reviews-Monemvasia_Fortress-Monemvasia_Monemvasia_Municipality_Laconia_Region_Peloponnes.html,"Monemvasia, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

Very variable quality of cooking,"We ate here twice over the Easter weekend. The first time was excellent. Succulent grilled prawns and enjoyable seafood pasta. So far - 5 stars.
However, we then ate there again after the midnight service on Easter Saturday/Sunday (i.e. about 12:30 in the morning) and the food was really poor. The spanakopita managed to be both burnt and stogy, the salads not at all enjoyable, and the best bit was the orange cake at the end. This was the 'set meal' for after the church service and the restaurant was full. But if they cannot cook its, then they should not offer it. And a 33 Euro per person we expected *much* better.

Unique and wondrous - buy your ticket online,"No words can fully describe the majesty and magic of this place. Just climb, look and wonder.
Thoughts on a couple of points raised by earlier reviewers:
1 Buy your tickets online - from the *official site* not a 'beat the queue' place - and then download to your phone. Simples. no queuing and the machines at the entrance will scan the code from your phone.
2 There have been complaints that that there is nowhere to buy sweets. Initially I thought this was a joke, but apparently not. Please note that this is a wonder of the world, not a shopping mall. Place (directly below the Parthenon) has show selling all the tat you may - or may not - wish to buy.

Charming,"Beautifully and carefully converted from a number of pre-existing buildings, the hotel is simply charming. It is really clear that great attention to detail has governed every aspect of the conversion - for example the exterior parts of each room's hair-conditioning system have been boxed in so that they fit with the environment. The room was fair-sized, and only the bathroom/shower was somewhat cramped. But since everything had to fit within an already -existing space, this is not a criticism. The place is clean and well-equipped, the toiletries, towel and duvet all excellent, and he simple breakfast was tasty. A great base for a weekend visit. As other reviewers have stressed - travel light!! We employed someone to take our cases from the town entrance to the hotel, which is at the opposite end of the lower town. Perhaps also worth mentioning that Monemvasia is *not* disabled-friendly.

Easy to reach from Athens,"This beach is just a few minutes walk from our house so we regularly visit in the summer, even if only for an hour or so. It is well-served by both bus and tram from central Athens.
Given that it is very close to Athens it is very good, but it gets incredibly crowded at weekends and the water is then covered in a film of sun-oil.

Dream also of more modern times - or the evzone who, when told by the germans to retire the Greek flag, wrapped it around himself and jumped over the edge - or of Manos Glezos who climbed the sheer face of the rock to replace the German flag with the Greek one - an act which was the probable reason for subsequent Greek governments not implementing the multiple death sentences they passed on him for political activity.

Lovely food by the beach,"After a 'discussion' with my wife, we decided to take our visiting family here. The alternative was a 'posh' place, but they can get plenty of those in London - but tavernas by the sea are not so plentiful there.
It is not easy to find, being down an alley next to Marathonas Village, and there is a small field that serves as their car park.
We went for lunch on March 25th, so the place was completely packed. However, service and food was still great. They seemed to cope with the crowd by cooking (frying mainly) huge batches on one dish at a time which they then distributed - so you food will come plate-by-plate.

A big climb - but worth it,"This has been severely damaged by earthquakes, and some has been 'refurbished'. Great views over the city, across the gluf and towards the sea.

Great Souvlaki and Gyros,"We visited twice over the carnival weekend. On the fist visit we got seat - the second was Sunday night of the carnival and everywhere was packed, so we got take away. Great gyros, great souvlaki and the Grec Burger (pork gyros in a bun with cheese, tzatsiki etc.) was memorable - an amazing feat for this kind of meal.

Perfect for the ferry or airport,The hotel is clean and the room was modern and with a little touch of style. Good breakfast and just a couple of minutes from the ferry. As an overnight base it was excellent - but not really suitable for a longer holiday visit as it is not that close to the beaches etc.,February 2019,Hotel Avra Rafina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1234491-d289570-Reviews-Hotel_Avra_Rafina-Rafina_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Rafina, Greece",hotels,4.0,3.5
Very mixed,"Very mixed feelings. Prawns excellent. Squid - my wife thought it fine, my opinion less so - and chips were soggy. Gavros poor, not properly cooked and a feeling that they are not fresh (owner disputed this but took it off the bill) and we noticed at least one other table sent them back. Service really pleasant but has to be reminded to being the wine and the squid arrived about 30 minutes after everything else.
So - pleasant service but very mixed feeling about the food.",January 2019,Deniz Meze,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3695532-d12235404-Reviews-Deniz_Meze-Paleo_Faliro_Attica.html,"Paleo Faliro, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
"Good food, family friendly","We visited after ice-skating at Hampton Court. It was recommended by my eldest daughter who visits often.

Great attraction - appalling queue management.,"Truly an amazing place and very well worth visiting.
however, the queue management is virtually noon-existent - compared for example to the companion Sea Life attraction.
We had am 11am ticket. the queue was almost 100m long and composed of people with tickets for all different times. NO attempt was made to sort these, or to allow people with early tickets in before those with later tickets (the people in front of us had a ticket for 2 hours later.)
The can and should sort this.

"Good food, very slow service","This is a good, solid taverna. It offers fresh and tasty grilled and cooked food and its sea-front location is wonderful. This is why it became our go-to place fro dinner in our week in Fionikounda.
The one drawback is the extremely slow service - as noted by other reviewers. ours was just slow (we often has to ask more than once for the bill and/or them to take the money and/or bring back the change), but on our visits we saw people at other tables ask for a bill (before we did) get the wrong bill, and then still be waiting after we had paid.
This is such a shame since is is simply a question of basic organisation and it is hard to understand why they cannot get this right - everything else is really good or excellent.",August 2018,Yialo Yialo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g667238-d10461504-Reviews-Yialo_Yialo-Finikounda_Pylos_Nestor_Messenia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Finikounda, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Nice people but not consistently good food,"We has dinner here and the location, the service etc. were all very good or excellent.
Sadly the food was not. Whilst my cod was well-cooked, the accompanying garlic sauce seemed to have been made without garlic, as did the tzatziki, and my wife's gavros (deep-fried little fish) was served cold.
Maybe we were just unlucky, but on subsequent nights we ate in 3 nearby restaurants and every one served better food.
During the day we often used the cafe's umbrellas etc. and their beach service for drinks was excellent, thanks mainly to the young lady who served the beach.",August 2018,Restaurant OINOYSSES Finikounda,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g667238-d4557415-Reviews-Restaurant_OINOYSSES_Finikounda-Finikounda_Pylos_Nestor_Messenia_Region_Peloponne.html,"Finikounda, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"Great views, family-friendly","The pebbly beach has great views and the water gets deeper at a good rate so that babies can safely play and yet you do not have to go more than a few m to swim.

Good solid taverna overlooking the harbour.,"We all had grilled meat here. Sadly there was no paidakia (lamb chops) the night we went, but my daughter and I had good, well- cooked meat and small fish respectively. My wife had pork from the spit which she found disappointing. Hence 4 not 5 'dots'.

Stunning castle - a must-see,"This is an amazing and historic castle situated at a strategic location, which shows Venetian castle building from different epochs.

"Surprisingly calm, 5* room, 2* food","It is strange that for a family-orientated hotel complex with over 400 beds, that my over-riding impression of the place is how calm and relaxing it was.
The key factor was that (to our surprise and delight) we are given a room in the Royal Olympian building which faced on to a semi-private pool shared with about 10 other rooms. Much of the time, you could lie or play the pool and believe that you are in an exclusive 5* hotel.
The only places where we were aware of the 1000 or so other guests were in the centre portion of the excellent beach (although the side of the beach in front of our building was significantly less crowded) and in the two mass main restaurants.
It is the latter which really shows that, whilst a great place to visit, this establishment is *not* 5 star in terms of overall quality. The two self-service restaurants are large, but well-designed to allow a good flow so that there is very little or no waiting line for food but the food itself is on the low side of expectations from a mass-catering organisation - not a 5* one. It is plentiful, bland and repetitive. We have had far better mass-catered food in other hotel complexes in Greece, notably those run by Grecotel in Olympia and Kalamata. There are other 'specials' restaurants in the complex but we did not use them.
Our daughter did not visit the Kids Club, other than for a visit to see the hotel's horses, but we joined enthusiastically in the 'fitness' activities and she in particular really enjoyed the Animation team's evening shows. The team is a great asset to the hotel, they were friendly, interacted well, and had absolutely unbelievable amounts of energy.
So - overall, an excellent experience with the room and the Animation team, but disappointing food in comparison with similar resorts in Greece.",August 2018,Aldemar Olympian Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1192010-d235774-Reviews-Aldemar_Olympian_Village-Skafidia_Pyrgos_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Skafidia, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great place to stay!!,"The hotel is just a few m from the sea on a quiet road. This is not a problem as the seafront is occupied by beds from cafes, not other hotels and we always managed to get an umbrella/bed. (All you have to do is buy a coffee or two during the day.)
The room was spacious, extremely clean and well-maintained. The kitchen area was well-equipped with sandwich and coffee makers and the fridge/freezer was large enough for our family. It also has a useful breakfast bar. The beds were really comfortable and we all slept well - helped no doubt by our exertions on the beach every day!
The smallish bathroom has shower/washbasin/toilet and the water pressure and temperature were good - no sudden surges or drops in temperature.
The balcony had sideways views towards the sea and was large enough for us to sit on for breakfast or in the evening.
The hotel also has three bikes, and my daughter and I used two to go to the supermarket/bakery in the morning (it is also easily walkable) for fresh provisions.
The hotel is made by the personality of its owner, Nikoletta who is always pleasant and ready to help.

Simply wonderful,"What is not to love? Spectacular views from high up above Kalyvrita; balcony to take in the views; jacuzzi in the chalet; (small) swimming pool outside, from which the views give a whole new meaning to 'infinity pool'; 2 double beds in different room; 2 toilets; breakfast cheese/meat/butter/honey/yoghurt/jam left in a well-stocked fridge with different coffee/tea and bread/biscuit options on the workbench (including a Nespresso machine); fresh fruit - like the breakfast things restocked daily; perfectly clean and well-kept; plus friendly but not intrusive staff.
