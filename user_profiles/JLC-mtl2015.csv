Old church in an ancient surrounding,"You must purchase your access to Ancient Agora to reach this building.

Only a few building are still standing on the premise of the Ancient Agora. This one is one of them and you can also step in to look at the walls that was restored in 1956.

It is a small, distinctive 11th century church among larger structure on the site. However, today, you get a better idea of the cachet of this historical building due to the restoration work.

There are many beautiful churches in Athens, we can’t stop at each of them. While we were on the Ancient Agora site, we opted to look inside and we were not disappointed.

Greek dramatist - Athenian New Comedy,"To us visitors, we might not know who Menander was but logically next to the Theater of Dionysus we could have concluded that he played a role in this field and we would have been correct. Menander was a Greek dramatist and a recognized symbol of the Athenian New Comedy. While most of his work was lost during the Middle Age, only parts of very few of the 108 comedies he wrote was found and other authors and comedians referred to him and his work. The title and the importance of this public figure to Greek culture during his time and after are undeniable and thus, explaining the fact that he deserves a spot in the Acropolis site.

While on the Acropolis site you can see also the Theater of Dionysus, the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and on top of the Acropolis Hill, surrounding the Parthenon you can see the Temple of Athena Nike, the ruins of Propylaea and the Erechtheion.

To me, National Gardens are a bit more attractive. Yes, it offers a green shade are, different paths and benches but that is it. The front of Zappeion (Zappeion Garden) is nice with the fountain and sculpture around the grounds.

But in the National Gardens, in August, a very high pitch insect sound did not make our journey in the area a relaxing one.

Don Juan autor - Lord Byron English romantic poet - Greek hero,"Not much information is indicated on the statue of Lord Byron in Athens. We only realized his importance to the Greece population when you read about his history.

Well, if I tell you the Story of Don Juan, does that help? Yes, Lord Byron the English romantic poet is also a Greek hero for political work during the Greek War of Independence.

Small and solid,"There are a few buildings/structures while atop of the Acropolis and this one is a little shy. Yes, because of its size and its location. Situated on the edge of the hill you are likely to be looking at your steps on your way up or down to access the gate and you may easily miss it.

On your way up once you cross the gate you will probably be naturally attracted to the Pantheon just in front of you. As you circle it, you may forget to turn around to see the Temple of Athena Nike.

When and if you take the time to look at it, it is clear that maintenance and conservation work has been done on the building. While it is small it looks solid with its beautiful golden white marble and four (4) columns on opposite sides of the temple, which all used to be a single piece stone columns. It says that at one point a wingless statue of Athena Nike was inside, symbol of victory in the hope that it will never leave the city.

While on Acropolis site you can see the Theater of Dionysus, Odeon of Herodes Atticus Theater and on the Acropolis Hill, surrounding the Parthenon you can see the Temple of Athena Nike, the ruins of Propylaea and the Erechtheion.

Sit and look. You will have a better perceptive: floors + bench + sculptures,"The Theater of Dionysus is part of the Acropolis Hill visit. While it sits at the foot of the hill, you are most than likely to see it on your way up when you are on the south side of the Acropolis. Don’t underestimate this place, it is said to be the first theater ever built and a great place for major artistic presentation event such as Greek comedy. Artists performed in front of as many as 19,000 people. S Unfortunately it does not look this impressive today.

You will see two important theater on your way to the Acropolis this one is the oldest and both are often mistaken. I went back to my photo to ensure I was taking about the correct one.

During my visit to Greece, I’ve seen many times the name Dionysus and I only understood on my return that Dionysus was actually the god of plays, wine, fertility and more. Thus the reason why he was honored on many occasions.

Part of this open air auditorium (it was reaching out even higher on the hill) have not survived the turbulent years however, do not just pass by. Sit on the stone bench, you can see a new perceptive and the hidden sculptures not visible when just passing by.

While on the Acropolis site you can see also the Odeon of Herodes Atticus Theater (closer to the Propylaea and the still active concert place) and on top of the Acropolis Hill, surrounding the Parthenon you can see the Temple of Athena Nike, the ruins of Propylaea and the Erechtheion.

Take a peek at the Atrium,"Zappeion is a beautiful yellow wide building in the National Garden sector near the Panathanaic Stadium. The choice of the location is not a mistake and was wisely designated for the proximity of the stadium in order to be used for the first modern Olympic Games. In fact, it seems to be the first building to be constructed specifically for the modern Olympic Games. While its vocation has changed over time and included political events, radio station, participate in different ways in a few Olympic Games (for press once, athletes at another time and fencing competition) it gives you an idea of the diversity and the potential of this building.

Today, its functions are mainly conference/Exhibits/meeting place where room as available to host public and private events.

"Origin of the Olympics is Athens, is this place!","This was our first stop to our visit in Athens and we were surprise by the quality of the structure and for a reason, it is actually one of the best preserve historic site. However, it is not as old as the other sites. While it was used back in 330BC it has been improved over time to welcome the 1896 first modern Olympic Games.
The less than 60,000 spectator marble horseshoe shape stadium is solid.

We understood that the decision of hosting the first Olympic games did come with an important challenge, funding. The city was, at the time, under financial difficulties and the construction of the stadium is undeniably associated with the financial contribution of prosperous entrepreneurs like George Averoff who made it possible and who’s statue is on the front of the site.

Free photo stop,"I have to admit that I was disenchanted when I noticed the Arch. I’ve come to realize that regrettably the real story is vague and uncertain and no information is provided on site.

We have to admit that it can be difficult to find our genealogy so going back to this time is a challenge. It is normal that we may have lost track of some elements. All we know is it is associated to Emperor Hadrian but was it under his initiation or a gift from the Athenians.

No added value - no learning experience,"If I remember correctly, Zeus being the king of the Olympian gods. This is the reason why they named this place Olympian Zeus.

It was under Emperor Hadrian that this ambitious project was finally completed after it took centuries to finish.

While I thought I was there to visit also Hadrian’s Arch, you actually do not need to get to the place to get close to the Arch. This site is the Temple of Olympian Zeus. Only a few columns have survived over the years. Some are laying down while some are still standing. You actually have a nice view of this site when you are atop of the Acropolis.

To me, not worth it on its own. However, this is where we purchased our combo ticket that allowed us to visit this site along others: Ancient Agora, Roman Agora, Hadrian’s Library and Acropolis. No line up.

Other reason to visit the Acropolis Site,"This is one of the two theater accessible on the slope of the Acropolis. This one is not the oldest but the one that has been renovated to welcome artists from around the world still today. The whole surrounding, the façade, the love story of Herodes Atticus, the city backstage and the Acropolis hill background makes this place way bigger than the 5,000 spectators capacity. No wonder why it is still active today and many musical performance have been held here. It provides a unique stage and show.

While on the Acropolis site you can see also the Theater of Dionysus and on top of the Acropolis Hill, surrounding the Parthenon you can see the Temple of Athena Nike, the ruins of Propylaea and the Erechtheion.

The Highlight of the Roman Agora,"The tower is a distinctive octagonal marble structure decorated of frescos on each facade and once you realize the function of the tower, you realize how clever it is. It is not only a clock tower it is actually considered the world's first meteorological station. It’s a combination of sundials, a water clock, and a wind vane used to stand atop.

The frescos represent the direction of the wind.

You can't visit this Tower only, This is part and my favorite part of the Roman Agora.

To access the Roman Agora, you can take a combo ticket that allowed us to visit this site along with others: Ancient Agora, Hadrian’s Library, Temple of Olympian Zeus and Acropolis. If this is in your plan.

Introduction to an impressive site: the Acropolis,"In Greek architecture, the porch or the entrance to an important site is called a Propylaea.

The Propylaea to the Acropolis is a great architectural example of this imposing Greek gate that leads you the monuments.

The structure is light in color and imposing in size. We have to wonder how did built such a remarkable gate at the time that cars did not exist. The marble, the balanced, fix and very tall columns sitting just the edge of the hill. You will be impressed and realize its amplitude as you get closer. It is not easy to just stop and look in this section you kind a need to move with the crowd.

On your way up if you can look on your right to see the Temple of Athena Nike.

A closer look at the details of the Acropolis,"You may wonder why or if you should visit the Acropolis Museum if you think about going or you went to the Acropolis Hill, well yes you should go. What happened is the Acropolis is very old structures and the reason why we are lucky it is still standing despite being expose to everyday wind, sun and climate is because of constant support and restoration. In order to preserve original masterpiece, they had to replace some original work on the top of the Acropolis with copies and they are keeping the original version at the museum.

In order words, the Acropolis Museum is an archaeological museum focusing on the Acropolis original artifacts. It allows you to have a closer look to the work of art.

Why doing both the museum and the hill, you get up close and the details at the museum and you get the surrounding context on top of the hill.

We followed other travelers’ recommendation and we visited the Acropolis Museum first and the next day we visited the actual Acropolis site. I think we all appreciated more the Acropolis Hill after seeing the museum. We had the time so we did.

From the entrance area, the clear floor allows you to see the exaction site underneath the museum.

Sitting right next to the Panthenon - on Acropolis hill,"This is part of your Acropolis visit.

What I liked about this building is the fact that it is different. Typical ruins are supersize buildings with imposing columns with frieze. This one has a unique feature. On one side, as you are coming in the Propylaea and see the Acropolis, you also see a porch with larger-than-life draped ladies columns. This is the Erechtheion.

While we saw the original version of the ladies in the Acropolis Museum, seeing the actual location and the surrounding is something even better. It is a great idea to have created replicas since it gives the perceptive and stature when sitting right next to the Pantheon.

While on the Acropolis site you can see the Theater of Dionysus, Odeon of Herodes Atticus Theater and on the Acropolis Hill, on site surrounding the Parthenon you can see the Temple of Athena Nike, the ruins of Propylaea and the Erechtheion.

Hidden - life-size statue of Nike,"Adjacent to the Roman Agora is Hadrian’s Library where you can find the ruins of the largest structure erected by Hadrian. While there is not much left on the site and it is very difficult to have enough imagination to realize the amplitude of the place, it is supposed to be more than a library, but also a place that held music and lecture rooms.

In a small room on the site of Hadrian Library, you can find one of the most interesting element: A life-size statue of a Nike (Victory) on a globe. But besides that… nothing more to see.

2 reasons to visit: Jules Cesar and the Tower,"The Roman Agora was a delimited square surrounded by shops, storerooms and offices. The Gate of Athena Archegetis marked the entrance to the market/business/commercial/trading area. When compared to the other historical site, you kind of wonder why you should stop here.

Well, I can give you 2 reasons:
1. Jules Cesar
2. The tower

Yes, the Emperor Jules Cesar played a role here, he with Augustus financed part of the construction.

The tower is a distinctive octagonal marble structure decorated of frescoes on each facade and once you realize the function of the tower, you realize how clever it is. It is not only a clock tower it is actually considered the world's first meteorological station. It’s a combination of sundials, a water clock, and a wind vane used to stand atop.

Can't miss it!,"The Parthenon sits proudly on top of the Acropolis Hill. The temple dedicated to the goddess Athena was completed in 438 BC.

It can be seen from many locations in the city.

Since it is part of the Acropolis visit, on site surrounding the Parthenon you can see the Temple of Athena Nike, the ruins of Propleia and the Erechtheion.

Today, luckily the basic structure still remains tall compared to other ruins in Athens. It gives a glimpse at the general overall size and imposing arrangement.

My suggestions for your visit:
1. Skip the line
Buy a multisite ticket at another attraction and pass the ticket booth.

You can go to one of the following less crowded attractions: Ancient Agora, Roman Agora, Hadrian’s Library, Temple of Olympian Zeus, Kerameikos, Aristotle’s School

2. Visit the Acropolis Museum first

We were all amazed by its beauty inside and out.

The entrance with the copper doors is something than the vestibule with mosaic all around representing different subject is just the beginning.

The interior with painted ceiling is not common, the stain glass is beautiful, the columns and the podium is of an incredible priceless beauty.

However, the Porte St-Louis was rebuilt to an improved version for today’s need. The previous style had narrow openings for pedestrian and carriage. With gates they were able to control access and prevent against potential invaders.

When at the Porte St-Louis you are at an easy walking distance of the Plains of Abraham, the Parliament building, the Citadel and the Chateau Frontenac. In fact, just follow the rue St-Louis (street) and you will get to the Chateau.

To me, you should visit both part to have a complete experience of the city.

You can walk the streets, walk up the stairs or take the funicular to reach the Upper Town when in the Lower Town.

Old Quebec is part of the Haute Ville, so is the Parliament Hill, the Plains of Abraham, many religious buildings, the Chateau Frontenac, the City Hall and many more historical buildings.
