A first-rate option for visitors to Athens,"Across the space of a fortnight’s holiday, we’ve been in and out of the Athenian Callirhoe four times, each time for a night or two. It’s absolutely efficient, comfortable and with a helpful, smiling, English-speaking staff.

If you’re heading for the Acropolis, its superb Museum, or the Plaka area – all of which are tourist ‘Big Ticks’, this hotel couldn’t be better placed. It is on a main road, which does make it noisy – on a couple of occasions, we had to close the door or window and fire up the air-conditioner. It’s also directly across the road from a large Greek Orthodox Church, whose bells sound irregularly in the early mornings – but that’s part of Athens’ charm.

The rooms are on the small side and perhaps in need an upgrade, but on each occasion, spotlessly clean. Tea, coffee and a kettle are provided in each room, and there is Wi-fi, the quality of which seems to vary from room to room.

Breakfast is standard Greek hotel fare, with a mixture of eggs, bacon, mushrooms, all the way to dolmades, bougatsa and the absolutely obligatory thick Greek yoghurt and honey. I’ve had better coffee but I’ve also had much worse and there is a selection of teas and infusions for those who prefer that option.

The only small downside: this is an hotel that appears to be consistently used by large tour groups of elderly Americans. Personally, I’m not fond of Americans in large numbers, especially when the sole topic of their conversation at breakfast appears to be their varied and alarming medical conditions! In fairness, though, they were smiling, courteous and – like the coffee – I’ve had a lot worse!

Would I stay at the Athenian Callirhoe again, despite the coffee and the transatlantic cousins? Without a doubt.",October 2019,The Athenian Callirhoe Exclusive Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d286943-Reviews-The_Athenian_Callirhoe_Exclusive_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Good, but....","The Argo is a typical Naxian boutique hotel – small, comfortably appointed, close enough to the beach and with a sea view in some rooms. Helpful, courteous staff, and our room was modern, well-appointed and enjoyed a reasonably-sized balcony with a distant sea view. (Our son and daughter-in-law reported that their non-sea view room needed a refresh – but I didn’t see that for myself…)

Breakfast is standard Greek hotel fare – delicious and encouraging me to eat too much!

Two major gripes, though: first, the internet in our room was almost non-existent. Down at reception, it was quick enough, but who wants to pad around a hotel’s public spaces in pyjamas while trying to pick up email or send pictures to family via email? I also developed an acute problem with my business back home, which needed fast internet access for a very short while – again, off to reception to solve the problem. It’s my view that any modern hotel that does not offer fast, reliable internet in-room needs a health warning.

Second, come sleep time, when we turned the lights off, a small night light came on in one of the ordinary light fittings. Brilliant, perhaps, if you have small children or are scared of the dark. Awful if you want full black-out. The problem was solved by removing the key tag from its socket (which is needed to activate the lights and air-conditioning) – but that also turns off all the power sockets – not much use if you’re charging camera batteries or cell phones or tablets, etc. Net result: on with an airline ‘sleep mask’, which I find very uncomfortable.

On balance, if I was offered the chance to come back here, I’d think twice about it because of these problems.

I can’t comment on price/value for money as this was part of a package bought for us from an Athens travel agent.",October 2019,Argo Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580192-d506473-Reviews-Argo_Boutique_Hotel-Naxos_Town_Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Naxos, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
Terrific value & delicious food,"Set about three or four streets back from the beach, this restaurant has a very large open-air patio, ringed by a small wall, which makes it ideal for watching the passing show, but also for corralling little people. There is also an enclosed patio for those evenings when the wind blows or the night air gets chilly.

We had been warned that the portion size for main courses was big, so we skipped starters. The warnings were accurate: baby goat with lemon, baby goat kleftiko, pork in tomato sauce and stuffed tomatoes were all plenty for all but the most gargantuan appetitites. Both baby goat dishes and the stuffed tomatoes were delicious, with the kid meat slow cooked and falling off the bone. Perhaps the chef could have dialled back on the green pepper in the kleftiko? The pork was also slow cooked in a delicious spicy tomato sauce but, unfortunately, was too dry.

The house white wine was poor – supposedly dry, but with a musty, sweet aftertaste, so we switched to red – a bottle of Diamantopetra – a mix of syrah and a local grape, mandilari, from the Diamantakis Winery in Crete. At €22.00, it was excellent value and the flavour – intense syrah but very different from a typical Rhone-style wine – accompanied the food well.

The final bill, for four people, including tip and wine was €87.00 which, I thought, was very good value.

To Helleniko is not on Chora’s main harbour but don’t let that put you off – it’s well worth a visit.",October 2019,To Elliniko,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580192-d1579829-Reviews-To_Elliniko-Naxos_Town_Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Naxos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Skip this one,"Recommended to us by our hotel, Ammos bills itself as a ‘Seafood and more…’ restaurant. On reflection, perhaps that should be changed to ‘Seafood and less…’?

Maybe it was because it was a Sunday night, but everything was flat, stale and with a couple of exceptions, simply unappetising. What was billed as a white taramasalata was suspiciously pink and lacking in flavour. The salads which accompanied the grilled squid and stuffed aubergines were as old as my great aunt and even the bread for the table was stale.

One exception – the grilled octopus, which was very tasty indeed when hot, but became rubbery and hard to chew as it cooled down. A portion of three small red mullet also started well, but it became obvious after a couple of mouth-fulls that they had been deep-fried in the same very old oil that has been used for the chips, which were awful. The stuffed squid was filled almost entirely with diced green pepper, which overwhelmed the dish.

The house white wine was drinkable – nothing more – and the entire experience, including tip, cost €110.00, which was, in my opinion and compared to what we have had at other restaurants in Chora, quite expensive.

Give this one a miss, unless it’s the only restaurant open on the harbour front and you’re extremely hungry.",October 2019,Ammos Seafood and More,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580192-d11744509-Reviews-Ammos_Seafood_and_More-Naxos_Town_Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Naxos, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.0

Amazing experience,"The day before we visited Delphi, I had been bored stupid at Ancient Olympia - just another collection of rocks, lumped in a field, to this untutored eye. I was preparing for more of the same at Delphi - and I could not have been more wrong! Perhaps it's the astonishingly beautiful setting? Perhaps it's ascending the Sacred Way? Perhaps it's the fact that the dreadful crowds from the tour coaches and cruise ships have been thinned out by the gradients? But I loved every moment at Delphi. I can quite see why the Oracle chose this spot.

A very solid choice - but awful coffee.,"Kastalia Boutique Hotel is on Delphi's main street, within easy walking distance to both the archaeological site and museum. The front of house staff were smiling, pleasant, efficient and our room was quite acceptable. If I'm less than 100% enthusiastic, the room was, in truth, slightly awkward: it looked great when we entered, it was pretty clean, but didn't quite have enough room for both my wife and my suitcases. A small balcony with a view over the valley down to the sea was a bonus, just beside the hotel's much bigger terrace, which has superb views.
Breakfast was typical of what we have come to expect in Greece - bacon, mushrooms, eggs, and a host of sweet pastries and breads - and one very big negative: the coffee was truly awful. An old-fashioned filter ""percolator"" system, which allows a glass jug of coffee to stand on a hot plate for hours, unless quickly emptied. The coffee becomes bitter immediately and a hotel of this class ought to know better.
I can't comment on the price/value for money aspect as this was part of a package bought via a travel agent in Athens.
Would I go back? Yes, but only when the owners confirm that they have upgraded their coffee machine!",October 2019,Kastalia Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189408-d1475703-Reviews-Kastalia_Boutique_Hotel-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Something of a puzzle,"The Arty Grand is supposedly a 5-star hotel. It's comfortable, the room we had for one night was spacious, with a view over the very large swimming pool. Yet the large bathroom - very large, in fact - did not have a shower. Yes, a jacuzzi tub with a hand-shower - but nowhere to attach the hand shower above knee height. My choice: either run a full, deep bath - very wasteful of water - or squat in the tub like a two-year old and hope not to wet the entire bathroom, waving the hand shower around.
Also - and this is my absolute worst - no kettle in the room for tea/coffee. Surely this is a staple of the modern hotel, five-star or otherwise?
An excellent breakfast, friendly staff, plenty of parking and good wi-fi.

Forget the Acropolis...,"After battling extraordinary crowds to get up the Acropolis - crowds that were, in my opinion, very badly marshalled, even dangerously so - to come down to the airy elegance of the Acropolis Museum was a joy. The design and layout, which mirrors the Acropolis itself, is such a stroke of simple genius. Photographs without flash are permitted in most sections and we were lucky enough to have the services of a good guide, herself a professional archaeologist. Absolutely terrific!

Most disappointing!,"We visited this restaurant about 12 months ago and had a very enjoyable experience, with excellent food. What a difference a year makes!

On arrival today, we were handed menus but the waiter immediately informed is that half the things on it were off. The substitutions didn't sound too appetising: ""Canelloni."" ""Yes, with what?"" ""No, cannelloni. It's Italian and vegetarian."" ""Right....""

My wife and I both ordered Vichyssoise, which, when it arrived, was delicious. But it was garnished with a blob of cold cheese (panacotta?) and tiny onion rings, which were stale - awful. Then my wife had a second starter, mussels, well enough cooked, but in a very sweet sauce, which simply didn't work. I ordered tuna, which came grilled the way I like it, but on a bed of saffron tomato - a thick melange of very powerfully flavoured red gloop, which completely overwhelmed the delicate texture and taste of the fish. I ended up scraping the tuna off its red bed - nasty.

Someone in the Franschhoek Kitchen is trying too hard to tweak or modernise classic dishes whilst not paying enough attention to both detail and balance of flavours.

We accompanied all of this with the Holden Manz Chenin Blanc 2018 - a well-built wine which worked well, despite the food. This is a wine estate which makes excellent wine - especially their reds.

Total bill, including tip, ZAR750.00, which for Franschooek, one of South Africa's more expensive villages, was about what we expected.

Consistent and excellent,"We first visited this small restaurant in 2006 and loved it then. Thirteen years later, I'm delighted to report that its standard is as good as ever, with same team running front of house and the kitchen! We started with a celebratory glass each of champagne - not cheap at €9.00 per glass, but delicious nonetheless - and opened with snails for me and free asparagus for my wife. The snails - escargots - came in a small glass, served in a delicious sauce verde - the asparagus were impeccable. Then duck breast for my wife and cassoulet for me. The duck was superb and the cassoulet the best I have eaten in many years. Be warned - it's a big portion...and my wife couldn't finish her duck, which was passed over to me. No room, therefore, for cheese or dessert. All of this accompanied by a modest Cotes du Rhone and our bill came to €112.00.

"Very friendly, very well priced.","Like so many cafés of its kind, Cafe Factory Republique is not much to look at from the outside. But that's more than made up for in the effusive welcome - in English, if you need - of M. le Patron. Add to that a menu that is basic - a plat du jour, salads, a half-baguette sandwich - but made from extremely fresh produce and very keenly priced. You won't be disappointed. My wife and daughter-in-law both had salads - ample portions, delicious - my son and I both had a sandwich filled with a local terrine. More than ample and just €5.00 for each sandwich.

Out of a Story-book,"We spent two nights in this hotel, which dates back to the 14th Century. Beautifully restored, our huge bedroom overlooked the gardens and River Tarn, and the circular bathroom was situated in one of the castle's turrets. Luxurious towels, soaps and so on, a massive king-sized bed, a delightful bar for pre- or post-dinner drinks - what more could we have wished for? Add in the River itself and a trail through the grounds of about 1.5kms along its wooded banks - spectacular. Very friendly staff, including a top-notch maitre d'hotel. Plenty of parking and reasonable, if not spectacular, Internet. I repeat the question: what more could we have asked for?

The answer, I'm afraid to say, is a restaurant with a rather more varied menu. The Chateau is quite far from anywhere - which is good - but that means you are confined to eating in their restaurant. The first night we enjoyed the food very much, but it's quite expensive and we would have preferred a little more variety on the second night. Buy your wine - even in the bar - by the bottle rather than by the glass, which cost us 8 euros each.

I would add that the cheese board is superb, so perhaps I'm quibbling. Recommend it? For sure.

Get some help!,"I have long extolled the virtues of French, family-run restaurants, in which Maman-et-Papa run the entire establishment, with perhaps a single young helper, comparing them to places of similar size in my native South Africa. There, dozens of staff seem to spend enormous amounts of time lounging around, chatting to each other and generally doing nothing to improve the service. However, on Monday night (20.05.19) at Cheminee Royale in Bordeaux, my theory was sorely tested.

The restaurant was almost full when we arrived, and shortly after, began turning people away. A couple – Maman-et-Papa? – was running front of house, with a single helper and it immediately became clear that they were not coping with the crowd. We waited and waited and waited to be noticed and finally were given some bread. It’s a strange, help-yourself arrangement to get wine: survey a good array of bottles marked with prices on shelves in two big cabinets, but having picked a modest Bordeaux Superieure, we battled to attract M. le Patron’s attention to draw the cork.

The restaurant has a reasonable `a la carte selection and, in the evening, offers two prix fixe menus – we opted for the €19.90 version, starting with a mixed mussels and prawns starter, one grilled tuna steak and one poached salmon, followed by a crème brulee and a panacotta.

“Sorry, no more tuna,” we were told a few minutes later.
“OK, make it two salmon, then.”
“Sorry, no more salmon,” came the reply. “We could do you some grilled trout instead?”

We had now been in Cheminee Royale for more than an hour, with nothing but the bread and wine.

When the mussels-prawns combo eventually arrived, it was clear that the mussels had been cooked in a nuclear reactor. Totally dried out and dessicated, they were inedible. The prawns were better, although the liquid in which both were swimming had a very suspicious smell. Not one to mop up with the bread.

The grilled trout turned out to be delicious, served with a very moist, well flavoured pyramid of rice. The crème brulee and panacotta were both equally good.

But by the time the bill was paid, we had been at the restaurant for more than two and a half hours. Way, way too long and definitely long enough to deter us from returning.",May 2019,Restaurant Cheminee Royale,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187079-d1322703-Reviews-Restaurant_Cheminee_Royale-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Bordeaux, France",restaurants,2.0,3.5
The worst hotel room I have ever stayed in.,"Room 402 at this hotel is the worst I have ever stayed in. It is certainly the only one which has caused me injury. On the fourth floor, it’s under quite flat eaves, which made manoeuvring around the spacious double bed extremely hazardous. Midway through our first night of three I got up to go to the bathroom, fully aware of the perilous route ahead of me. To no avail – I still managed to crack my head on a window join. Blood flowing down your face at three a.m. does not endear you to a hotel. Over the next three days, no matter how hard we tried not to, both my wife and I had bumped our heads repeatedly.

Once in bed though, the sheets were spotlessly clean.

Tiny bathroom, sure, but I was not impressed by the black algae along the line of the pipes. It’s tough to clean, once established, but a toothbrush and a strong grout cleaner ought to do the trick.

Free tea and coffee was provided in the room, but only using ridiculous, tiny, disposable, plastic cups. On our third night, the cups had not been renewed, so we were reduced to sharing an early morning cup of tea from the single remaining one.

Room 402 abuts the hotel’s breakfast room and I can tell you the breakfast staff starts working at around 05:30. That’s because I could clearly hear doors opening and closing amidst preparations for the repast.

Did I mention that Room 402 overlooks Bordeaux’s main pedestrian thoroughfare? It seems they party hard in this beautifully restored city. Our first night in town was a Saturday and we could hear still youngsters howling up and down as dawn broke. Sunday night was not a great deal better, although by Monday, our final night, they seemed to have run out of steam.

Returning for a moment to breakfast. The room itself was not dissimilar to our own 402 – crippled by low eaves. But the food itself was plentiful, fresh and tasty. It won’t be enough to bring us back, though. At least not if Room 402 is the only one on offer.

Note: there are three rooms on the top floor of this hotel: 401, 402, 403 – I’m guessing that all would have the same problem with the roof. But rooms on lower floors might be perfectly acceptable.

My wife had asked for her eggs to be cooked 'medium' but one was still runny and my mushrooms and sausage were smothered in a most unappetising brown baste or sauce. My bacon was also overcooked.

Forget God's Window - visit Kings Walden instead.,"Well, that was the opinion of both my wife and myself, and we've been to both now. The view from the terrace is just spectacular and to be able to enjoy it with a glass of something chilled in hand is even better. Our room was a delight: plenty of space, a comfortable bed, spotlessly clean and with an enormous, separate bathroom. Then came dinner - not quite at Michelin levels, but certainly with aspirations in that direction and reasonably priced. It's an add-on extra, and I suppose you could trek the 15kms or so back into town if you wanted a burger or KFC, but if that's your fancy, then maybe Kings Walden might not be the right venue for you. Breakfast certainly is included and it was equally tasty and large.

There is complimentary wi-fi but it was not very good - I carry my own and used that instead. Not a deal-breaker, though.

One small caveat - the property is not fenced, and although it has a night watchman, we were rather alarmed when le patron Billy banged on our door quite late after supper to say that ""someone had been spotted wandering around the parked vehicles"" and could we come and remove anything of value from our car? Given that we were heading up to Kruger National Park for two weeks in the bush, that meant unshipping quite a lot of kit. Not ideal, I'm afraid, but at least the intruder was spotted before any damage could be done.

"Best Guided Walk in Berlin - and many other places, too.","Over the past couple of weeks, my wife and I have done a number of guided walks in several European capitals, some as part of a group and some with a personal guide (Budapest, Vienna, Prague). Holger Raschke, founder of Berlins Taiga, was easily the best of the bunch.

Why?

First, we picked him to talk to us about life in the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and to guide us and walk us through East Berlin - the Red Metropolis, as he aptly calls it. It's a 4-hour tour, which may sound a lot, but there's a pit stop around half-way, and a couple of bus and train rides, which provide a brief rest.

Holger's knowledge is not only encyclopaedic, but personal: he grew up in Potsdam, in the former East Berlin and can talk from memory about things like receiving gift parcels from relatives in the West. Where was he on the night the Wall came down? What were his parents doing? It's a very different perspective from the run-of-the-mill young tour guides used by the big companies who are quite often Brits or Americans or Aussies and who simply quote from history books, with lots of ""Hello, darling,
nudge-nudge, wink-wink"" asides thrown in.

Second, Holger is personable and engaging - he made sure that my wife, 70, was comfortable at all times. She has an interest in architecture and Holger took us along Karl Marx Allee, formerly Stalin Allee, which is a living text book of the development of residential building styles in East Berlin. Immensely interesting.

Third, by his own admission, he grew up with many East German youngsters who looked upon their young Russian chums as natural friends. He maintains those friends to this day and is more than able to offer a perspective that is not one normally seen through western eyes. Don't misunderstand me - this is not a propaganda trip: far from it, it's nuanced, thoughtful and highly informative and really did enable us to gain a different perspective of life behind the Berlin Wall and in East Germany.

Exactly what we were looking for.

Along the way we also visited several places that ordinary tours don't bother with but which are spectacular, culminating in the Russian War Memorial at Treptower Park. Truly remarkable and I was humbled to have visited.

Thanks, Holger - a most excellent morning in Berlin.",May 2017,Berlins Taiga,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187330-d12258362-Reviews-Berlins_Taiga-Potsdam_Brandenburg.html,"Potsdam, Germany",attractions,5.0,5.0
High point of our Budapest visit,"Three days in Budapest: what to see, what to do? I left the hours of daylight to my wife, but thought, ""Let me treat myself to a guided photo tour..."" I don't shoot of lot of cityscapes or buildings, and certainly not at night (I live in South Africa and my main subjects are birds and larger fauna) so let me see what I can learn.

Miklos delivered big time - he knows his city and his subject, and even though he's a Canon shooter, he was more than able to offer me advice on settings for my Fujis.

But what made this tour special was that a) he offered a local Food Tour first and b) he allowed my wife to come along for the photography tour - at no extra charge. He was solicitous at all times, making her feel extremely comfortable, answering all her questions - a perfect host. Even if you are the 'passenger', non-paying, you'll get a very different view of Budapest from the 'ordinary' daytime tours.

I also learnt a great deal about early evening and night photography, for which, Miklos, many thanks.",May 2017,Photo Tours in Hungary by Miklós Mayer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274887-d8820680-Reviews-Photo_Tours_in_Hungary_by_Miklos_Mayer-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Almost there, but needs some work.","Situated just inside the walls of Marrakech's old Medina, this riad has some very pleasant touches and one or two others that could do with some attention.

First, on the upside, it was generally very clean, classically airy, has a delightful roof-top terrace, some helpful, if a little self-effacing, staff and is very well placed for access to Marrakech's famous Djmaa al Fnaa square, and all its evening food stalls, if that's your thing.

Breakfast seems to be the standard Moroccan fare: fresh orange juice, yoghurt, and various breads and pastries, accompanied by jam, honey and coffee. I must add that after 10 days of this in various venues across the country, I began to long for my wife's home-made muesli- if I return, I'll bring my own supply.

Our room was decorated in faux-Arabian nights style - amusing for a few minutes at first, but irritating for the rest, with a bed sunken into a concrete plinth - ideal for a strained ankle or worse in the middle of the night. The door into the small but adequate bathroom was also Moorish in style with two sharp wood carvings sticking out at head night. Sway slightly left or right as you pass through and you risk a severely bruised cheek-bone or worse. No armchair of any sort, just a few cushions on the floor, and - most irritating of all - nothing on which to place two quite large hard-shelled suitcases. Except the concrete plinth at the end of the bed, but then, if you don' close the suitcases and move them elsewhere, something else to fall over as you try to navigate to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

One final gripe. The riad's two main courtyards both had rain covers in place when we stayed there. I'd not seen this variety before, but it's a big, see-through cover and rain water gathers in the centre. Give it enough and the cover will obviously break. So it needs a drain and a hole in the cover's centre drops what is, in effect, a flexible, mobile gutter downpipe, to take water away. But it's a fall of three stories, so this is a long, transparent pipe that dominates the courtyard. And in both courtyards, the downpipe, made of the same transparent plastic as the main cover, is dirty. Very dirty. The net effect reminded me of nothing so much as the cord that runs down the back of a crustacean, and which we remove before cooking and eating. What George, Matt and Gary on ""Masterchef Australia"" call ""the poo-chute"". I fully understand the need for this device, but just as you clean the scum-line in a swimming pool, it needs to be kept as clean as possible. Otherwise...well, it's too prawn-like for comfort!

Would I recommend Riad Aladdin? Yes, despite the negatives, we enjoyed our time there.",November 2016,Riad Aladdin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293734-d1181276-Reviews-Riad_Aladdin-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",hotels,3.0,4.5
Crushed by Tourists,"We visited three medinas during our November 2016 trip to Marrakech: Chefchaouen, Fez and Marrakech. Of the three, Marrakech's was the most unpleasant by a long chalk. It is clogged with tourists, the various stalls all seem to sell the same tourist tat, and unlike the other two, cars go up and down its main streets and, more alarmingly, mopeds and motorbikes zoom up and down its narrow alleys at pace.

The main square is the much-vaunted Djmaa el Fnaa, which certainly comes alive after dark when the food stalls set up. This is a interesting, if not altogether, pleasant experience. As you look from stall to stall to try and assess what's on offer, you are besieged by touts, crying the excellence of their particular employer. One stall in particular - at the end of the row and whose number I regret I did not note - sold only fish. Fried, calamari, etc., and it was truly excellent. Another - No.21 - informed us that ""mother"" was doing the cooking, and she lived up to her billing: fried aubergine, chips, long thin kebabs and kefta - lamb meatballs - again, excellent. But on our third and last night, we fell between two stools - a stall that seemed to offer a bit of everything. It was dreadful - so you need to fight off the touts and try to look around you.

I should add that we declined to go back for a fourth night and went instead to the Kosybar, in the Place des Ferblantiers, near our riad. Kosybar is licensed and serves a reasonable seafood pizza and expensive drinks - we shared a bottle of Cuvée du President red, at 190 dirhams, and although it tasted well enough, it still gave me a 3am hangover.

I cannot see any reason to recommend the Marrakech Medina - unless it's just to use as a base for excursions elsewhere with some cheap food thrown in. I might add that Marrakech itself is much, much bigger and looks very much more interesting.",November 2016,Medina of Marrakesh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d324126-Reviews-Medina_of_Marrakesh-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",attractions,2.0,4.0
On the one hand and on the other.,"This is a tale in two parts. The first is that the hotel is situated just outside the very main part of old Chefchaouen, so it’s remarkably convenient for heading straight into tourist central, the medina. It’s very clean, and has plenty of authentic Moroccan touches. In fact, it’s very pretty and has a superb view over the famous blue town. A helpful porter carried our suitcases up to the third floor - no lift (elevator to our American readers).

A very comfortable king-sized bed awaited us and a small fridge with two small bottles of water. The bathroom has a very, very small washbasin, western-style lavatory and large shower, which worked very well on our first evening. Clean towels, soap, shampoo, etc.

But there is another side to this establishment.

Most importantly, for those who value a good night’s sleep, it’s noisy. A Japanese tour group were here for our first night and we shared every moment of their experiences - at least, those of the folk in the room beside us and the room on the floor below. As they battled with the locks on the door and regaled their friends below about their problem; as they dragged furniture around, and then put it back just before their early departure the next morning; as they left luggage outside their door and reminded the same friends on the floor below to do the same. Even the sound of their micturition at three in the morning. (Well, we all do, don’t we - at least those of us with some grey in our beards? But we shouldn’t have to listen to each other as it happens.) The toilet flushing, then water running as hands were washed. And I’m sure they heard us doing mush the same.

I couldn't help noting that the same Japanese tour group seemed to have been offered a rather better class of breakfast than we were - but we did have plenty of delicious local pastries, breads, tapenade, jams and honey, while they also were given what looked like cold ham and eggs. Be warned - the coffee in the urn is dreadful.

And our hot water refused to work. So no early morning shower before breakfast, although it was eventually fixed and we were able to clean up before meeting our guide for a walk around the town at nine.

I should also add that we stayed two nights, and on the second night, the Moroccan couple in the same room next door were very quiet and at our second breakfast, we were also offered eggs - fried, boiled, etc.

I also suspect that our room - No. 8 on the top floor - is just too close to the main plumbing for a quiet stay.

On balance, would I recommend Dar Echaouen? Without seeing the alternatives, that’s a tough one, but given that it has light, a certain amount of space and is away from the hustle and bustle of the medina, very probably.",November 2016,Dar Echchaouen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304013-d952618-Reviews-Dar_Echchaouen-Chefchaouen_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima.html,"Chefchaouen, Morocco",hotels,3.0,4.5
Tourist Central,"Chefchaouen is delightful from afar - the famous blue city. (Well, it looks more like a big village to me, but I'm open to correction.) Get closer, drop down into the medina and it quickly becomes apparent that you have arrived in what I call a 'tourist chute' - whichever end you approach from, you're on a path along which the various vendors view you as a mobile cash dispenser.

We stayed over the Moroccan Independence Day long weekend in mid-November, so most of our fellow tourists were from places like Rabat, Tangier, etc., and they were being fleeced just as hard as we were.

The central square - Place Outa el Hammam - is noisy, full of screeching kids and liberally smeared with excrement from the plague of feral cats. If you visit, be very careful where you put your feet and your bag. The restaurants all serve identical food, bar Morisco, which does a terrific goat, prune, honey and almond tagine. Try Cafe Restaurant Sofia just behind the square instead.

The Kasbah is a complete waste of time and money - happily the entrance fee was included in our overall price, otherwise I'd've been bleak. It's a modern restoration - as is much of the town - and as soulless as a Disney theme park. No, in fact, I've been to Disneyland in Paris and that had quite a lot of verve, which could pass for soul.

With hindsight, I'd probably give Chefchaouen and the Place Outa el Hammam and the Kasbah a miss altogether next time. One positive - most locals we encountered, despite trying to sell us tourist tat, were unfailingly polite, charming and helpful - that's been our experience so far throughout nearly all of Morocco.",November 2016,Place Outa el Hammam & Kasbah,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304013-d7222032-Reviews-Place_Outa_el_Hammam_Kasbah-Chefchaouen_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima.html,"Chefchaouen, Morocco",attractions,2.0,4.0

We arrived early and thought we had booked an early check-in but that turned out to be incorrect. No matter - we went for an early walk around central Casablanca and the helpful staff had a room prepared for us by 10.00. One sour note - beware the breakfast charge. Our early arrival the previous day meant that we had used up our paid-for breakfast, so on our departure day, breakfast had to be paid for: 300 dirham - outrageously expensive!

Better alternatives,"Situated in the main square of the old part of town, directly opposite the old recently-restored castle, Morisco had been recommended to us by our tour operator. This part of Chefchaoeun is a mega-tourist trap (much like the entire town, in truth) and it provided a good meal, but only so far. I had a goat tagine, with prunes, almonds and honey - super sweet and delicious. My wife had a beef tagine with prunes and sesame - somewhat ho-hum.

Don't think twice - eat here.,"This is a gem and it delivered the first Moroccan meal of our trip that really lived up to expectation. It is situated just behind the main square in the old part of town and when we arrived looked a little empty and almost about to close. Far from it. The owner welcomed us (he speaks good English) and almost as soon as we had sat down a number of other parties arrived and were soon tucking in to the excellent food. I had a kofta tagine - tiny balls of ground veal meat in a tomato-based sauced with a fried egg in the middle; my wife had a basic beef couscous - also delicious. Portions not stupidly big - just enough, in fact - and should we have stayed another night in this town this is the only place to which we would have returned. For the two dishes plus a 1.5l bottle of water and a tip - 100 dirham.

Tourist trap par excellence,"From afar and from the guide books, Chefchaouen looks like a pearl: a blue-washed village draped onto the side of a pair of hills, from which it gets its name. As we approached, I was reminded of Cassis or parts of Provence. But then we were dropped into the main part of the old town, the Medina, a not terribly difficult labyrinth of alleyways that consist of small shops designed to fleece tourists of their dirhams. I felt that every pair of eyes was viewing me as just another walking cash dispenser. The tourist offerings all appeared to be the same and over-priced. We had asked to stay here for two nights, not just one, and to be frank, even one night would have been more than enough. Were it not for the fact that it's quite a long way from anywhere, Chefchaouen could be seen and done in a single afternoon. I should add that just about everyone we met outside of the main square was unfailingly polite and helpful - that makes up for a great deal.",November 2016,Chefchaouen Medina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304013-d1751665-Reviews-Chefchaouen_Medina-Chefchaouen_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima.html,"Chefchaouen, Morocco",attractions,3.0,4.5

Nothing seems to be too much trouble for Colleen, who even woke up at 5 a.m. to serve us coffee and rusks ahead of a local half-marathon which we were about to run. Her team includes husband William, who makes a mean breakfast with delicious fresh free-range farm eggs, local fruit, yoghurt and butter. The rest of the staff are well-trained, courteous and smiling. It might be in the middle of the Klein Karoo, but the free wi-fi in each room also works a treat.

OK Hotel - but unlikely to return.,"I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years - never for more than a single night, always en route from somewhere in the north to somewhere in the south. Its main attractions - large, clean rooms, big, comfortable double beds and - most important - a good, local steakhouse attached to the hotel. However, on our arrival last Friday night, we discovered that the steakhouse had moved elsewhere. The hotel's own dinner menu is limited, its kitchen is poor, so we were forced to go to a nearby mall to find food. Not ideal after a long day on the road. Net result?

A Tired Old Lady,"The Internet WiFi in our unit was dreadful - and a limit of 200MB per day is miserly. In the modern age, many of us run businesses that are Internet-dependent, so poor WiFi and ridiculously small caps are a deal-breaker. I also felt the resort is looking tired - corridor carpeting, paint, etc. And two great big rusty air conditioner units on our balcony - a real eyesore! That's why, I'm afraid, I would find it difficult to recommend The Peninsula to others.

On the upside, to be fair, the view is spectacular, the unit was spotless and well equipped. Our bedroom, however, had a window which opened out onto the corridor. Despite a louvre blind that had to closed at night, which made for quite an airless sleep.

At 25 euros per head, including wine & port, we were expecting something out of the ordinary. It was not to be. Some sad chunks of melon dotted with five tiny pieces of local ham were paired with a very so-so rosé. Then came a truly awful overcooked chicken breast, with watery green beans and mashed potatoes. The accompanying Douro red wine was OK. Finally, some kind of stodgy chocolate tart topped with what appeared to be artificial cream and a very poor port.

We had also tried the Quinta's white port apéritif before dinner, under the oddly-named Tonnix label. It would probably have been better used to wash the car windscreen. Very nasty.

Very Mixed Feelings,"We’ve just spent 10 days at Le Maritim - my wife and me, my one adult son and his fiancée, my other adult son and his girlfriend. The purpose: an advance celebration of my 60th birthday.

Would I return and would I recommend the hotel?

I have to say that the more I think about it, the less convinced I am that the answer to either question would be yes.

Let’s start off with the positives: Le Maritim, part of a family-owned German group, is well-priced compared to the competition. It’s situated in a wind-free corner of the north-western part of the island. The capital, Port Louis, is about 10kms south, and the nasty tourist trap, Grand Baie, about 15kms north. On the beach, however, you’re unaware of either. It sits on the mouth of the Citron River - walk up the estuary on the Maritim side and you arrive at the ruins of Balaclava, an old sugar estate set up by one of the original owners in the 19th Century. These are used for functions, but you can also walk through and around them during the day and at night.

In fact, one of Le Maritim’s strong points is the extensive grounds, including a small golf course. You can, run walk or saunter to your heart’s delight.

The beach is also extensive, with the obligatory sun loungers, palm-thatched shades, white sand and safe swimming area.

We were on a Half Board package - breakfast and dinner included but pay for your own booze. We’ve been to Mauritius five or six times over the years and that’s the way we do it: Mauritius has punishing import taxes on liquor, so you stock up at the airport duty free, buy your mixes at the local café (what South Africans call a corner store) and carry on. There’s always a mountain of food at breakfast, so who needs lunch anyway?

Also included - snorkelling twice a day, water-ski-ing between 10.00-12.00 and 14.00-16.00, glass-bottomed boat (also used for snorkelling), kayaking and pedalo. (I think dinghies and/or hobie cats were also available free if you know how to sail one - we’re not sailors, so double check, if that’s your thing.) The golf course is free - if you have your own clubs and balls. Archery - with some very decrepit gear - also free.

So far, so good.

We arrived quite late, were warmly greeted on check-in, and then informed that the restaurant would be closing in 15 minutes and that men are not allowed in wearing shorts. No exceptions - not even for late arrivals. Which meant both of my sons had to race to their rooms, shower, change into long pants and then arrive for the last five minutes of the buffet, once again dripping with sweat.

Surely a more appropriate response would have been to waive the rule - “just this evening, sir, because you’ve just arrived - but tomorrow evening, please adhere to our dress code.” (You may or may not agree with the long-pants-for-men-in-the-evening-rule, but it’s pretty standard in Mauritius and we were well aware of it…but on arrival, with 15 minutes to go before closing?)

We had asked for three rooms side by side, which we got, and in the quietest part of the hotel, which we did not. No sooner had we shovelled some food into us and retreated to our rooms than the thump-thump-thump of the sega dancing demonstration from the hotel’s poolside dance floor came crashing in. Close the doors, crank up the air conditioner and the noise was somewhat blocked out. However, a couple of nights later, one of my sons was kept awake into the wee small hours by a door beneath their room opening and closing. Yes, they were above the kitchens, and someone was preparing something. The next morning, they asked to be moved and were refused - “Sorry, the hotel is running at 96% occupancy - nothing else is available.”

Again, in fairness, most evenings we needed doors closed and air con running - it’s very hot and humid at this time of year - but even so, the various noises kept my wife awake for several nights and my son on another. Not good enough.

The rooms themselves are fine - small balcony, big enough for four chairs, and with a great sea view. Beds very comfortable and everything very clean. The bathrooms are adequate - maybe on the small side for a South African, but quite large when compared with some hotel bathrooms I’ve encountered in Europe. Lots of dry towels whenever you need, too. The girls complained that there was no conditioner with the shampoo - I don’t have so much hair these days, so can’t really comment.

One serious problem - at random moments during a shower, the water would suddenly become scaldingly hot. And I mean scalding - dangerously hot. We complained, but nothing happened.

The main restaurant is large, (as is the hotel, by the way: 450 guests when we were there) and at the breakfast buffet, there is as much as you can eat of almost everything. One exception is smoked marlin, a Mauritian delicacy. It appeared twice during our stay, as opposed to daily in previous trips to other hotels. One son, who has worked at the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town, says that marlin is now scarce because it’s been fished out over the years for people like me who want to eat it for breakfast. If that’s true, mea culpa. When there was no smoked marlin, the hotel provided smoked salmon. No real complaint on that score.

The evening meal was a different scenario, however. Again it’s a giant buffet - but why was every meat dish, including chicken, overcooked? Pork, lamb, beef (including a desperate Beef Wellington), all cooked to a dull, dry greyness, every night. Awful. The Mauritian/Indian/Creole food was often a much better bet. I’d find it very hard to recommend this, I’m afraid.

Maybe the chefs prepare the food this way for their target market: we saw a large number of middle-aged and elderly German, French and British visitors - could this be the way they like their food back home? (My late father, from the north-east of England, could take a beautiful piece of fillet steak and reduce it to something small and black, like a charred matchbox. He claimed to like it that way…)

One very big positive, albeit an expensive one: Le Maritim’s spa - my wife treated herself and the other girls to a session in the spa and said it was truly wonderful. Not much more expensive than the same sort of thing in South Africa, she added.

So what was the key problem?

Le Maritim’s style is that what I’ve described above forms “the basics”. But if you want anything else, you reach into your pocket and pay more.

The best piece of beach is roped off - you can go there, but you have to book your slot, and pay. There are several other restaurants at the hotel - all more expensive than the main restaurant. Want to hire a bike? You can, a very clapped out old mountain bike for a 4km ride to the café - pick up some mixers - cycle back - 30 minutes - “Sorry, sir, that’s 300 rupees…” Have a scuba demo - yes, five metres up the main pool and back - “If you want any more, it’s 2,400 rupees.” Taxi to Port Louis? “Certainly, sir - 1 600 rupees for four people” Additional bottle of water? “By all means, sir - 100 rupees, please.”

I was left with the distinct impression that Le Maritim is a well-oiled machine designed to extract as much extra cash from its visitors as possible, once the poor victims are trapped there. Trapped is also a word I use deliberately - we had been told that the nearest bus stop was 1km from the hotel, but in fact it was 4kms on a fairly unpleasant, narrow road.

Again, in fairness, we opted for one of the fancy restaurants - the beachside La Marée - to celebrate my birthday and the experience was largely outstanding. Two of us had a smoked marlin salad to start and needed a microscope to find the marlin. We also had to send back seared tuna - the hopelessly overcooked problem again - but the staff re-appeared in moments with the fish properly cooked. And a delightful little birthday cake was presented to me at the end of the evening. This was an evening at a restaurant I would certainly recommend. Not cheap, but not a great deal more than a similar restaurant in Johannesburg or Cape Town.

One final issue - a message informing us that our return flight the following day to Johannesburg had been delayed by four hours reached the hotel just after 15.30. At 18.45, when I left my room to go to supper, the message had not been delivered, so I only saw it after supper, when I returned to the room at around 22.00. Which was far too late to start attempting to make alternative arrangements. Net result - missed ongoing connections in Johannesburg for four of our party, re-booking fees and a night in a Johannesburg hotel for me and my wife. Significant flight delays are - in my view - urgent messages and should be treated as such.

Would I recommend Le Maritim to you? Yes, provided you understand the way the hotel works and are prepared to deal with the constant attempts at up-selling, as well as the overcooked food.

Would I go back? No, I think I’d try somewhere else.",November 2014,Maritim Resort & Spa Mauritius,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g488101-d305559-Reviews-Maritim_Resort_Spa_Mauritius-Balaclava.html,Mauritius,hotels,3.0,4.5
The Noise!,"I'm writing this at 1.40 a.m. with noise from the Montecasino resort, of which this hotel is a part, pounding through the floor and walls. That's in addition to the road noise from just outside my room. It's a pity because the room itself is quite pleasant - basic, but clean and comfortable.

Avoid Yindees - rip offs here.,"A first visit, looking for a moderately priced dinner for five of us. We'd heard good things about Yindees and the menu looked reasonable. However, it quickly became apparent that this might not be the case, with a heavily over-priced wine list. We settled on a Durbanville Hills Shiraz at R185 - at least 50% higher than I would expect. This wine retails at around R45, so draw your own conclusions. My wife and I both had variations on a mixed seafood curry - good flavours but we needed forensic investigators to find the seafood. If I'd wanted vegetarian, that's what I would have ordered. However, the final straw came with the bill, reflecting a 10% service charge - labelled tips - already added in in very tiny letters, a total, and then, beneath that space for GRATUITIES another TOTAL. Each of the two last had hand-written letter 'R's beside them, to draw my attention. In other words, the staff were hoping that I would not notice the first 10% and then add 10% more.

I told the waiter that I did not like it when a restaurant tried to cheat me - whereupon I was fed all sorts of nonsense about this being ""something only the manager could do"" and ""they had never seen it before"". We paid and left - the waiters turned their backs and didn't even offer to hold the door open for us.

Needless to say, we will not be back under any circumstances.",April 2014,Yindee's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1722390-d1961979-Reviews-Yindee_s-Cape_Town_Western_Cape.html,"Cape Town, South Africa",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Excellent value and a new menu,"Five members of our family visited this branch of the very popular pizza chain for a light, early supper. Three big gourmet salads and two half-and-half pizzas later, accompanied by two bottles of shiraz and one bottle of chardonnay, a couple of bottles of mineral water, a tip - and all for exactly R1,000. Very good value in my book. The salads were substantial, plenty of fresh leaves and other ingredients. I had a half-and-half Morituri and Nacho Libre - delicious. (So much for the 'light' bit in my super!) The half and half concept is, as far as I understand it, new to Col'Cacchio - as are a number of other variations, including labelling of what type of food/meal might be appropriate to which kind of diet. Two of our number are following the currently faddish Banting Diet - even that's there - and there was a very delicious gluten-free pasta for my wife, who is gluten intolerant.

One slight gripe - this is one of those buildings where sound seems to echo off the walls and ceilings - as it filled up, it became harder and harder to follow the conversation around our own table.",April 2014,Col'Cacchio Foreshore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312659-d812816-Reviews-Col_Cacchio_Foreshore-Cape_Town_Central_Western_Cape.html,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Not so bonny at Bonnievale River Lodge,"My wife and I had booked the Farm House and adjacent West Suite at Bonnievale River Lodge for a weekend catch-up with two old friends. At first, everything seemed fine - very picturesque, adjacent to a large camp-site which, in turn, gives on to the Breede River. But as the weekend wore on, one missed detail after another let the experience down. Dog poop right outside our door - not picked up; rooms not serviced; a dishwasher that didn't work properly; bathroom windows without curtains; the tiniest of wall-mounted TVs in the main room; and finally, no hot water on the second morning. There's building underway and the kitchen door was sealed up with a mixture of grubby towels, bits of old rag and paper, to prevent the dust getting in. Not very alluring. We were also amazed at the fact that by Saturday morning, the campsite was absolutely bursting at the seams - forget any idea of a gentle stroll down to the river - it was a sea of tents. And many, many, many insects - more of the irritating kind, rather than biting - but if you decide to go, take a good repellent.

On the upside, the staff (the few that we saw) were friendly and the camp-site, despite the large number of people present, was quiet.

Not one to revisit, I'm afraid.",February 2014,Bonnievale River Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2100817-d2643845-Reviews-Bonnievale_River_Lodge-Bonnievale_Overberg_District_Western_Cape.html,"Bonnievale, South Africa",hotels,2.0,4.0
Be Chairful Of This Hotel!,"In most respects, this hotel is excellent. Beds are comfy, bathrooms are spotless, there's a good work surface with several different power points, even inputs for AV. But. But. But. The single chair provided is an instrument of medieval torture. Often, I need to work for two or three hours in my room - with this chair, more than 15 minutes became difficult. It's cheap, nasty, hard. Nor was there anything else in which to sit back and relax. Thus, my options were either stand or lie on the bed. Not great and - frankly - not what I would have expected from a hotel of this calibre. The other limiting factor is that the wing of the hotel in which I stayed overlooks the rooftop of the adjoining (and very good) shopping centre. Open the window for fresh air and you have the roar of the centre's air conditioners and the exhaust fans of its restaurants. Noisy and smelly. A major plus, however, is a very good gym with a great view over Johannesburg's northern suburbs.",November 2012,Southern Sun Hyde Park Sandton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312586-d1742330-Reviews-Southern_Sun_Hyde_Park_Sandton-Sandton_Greater_Johannesburg_Gauteng.html,"Sandton, South Africa",hotels,3.0,4.5
