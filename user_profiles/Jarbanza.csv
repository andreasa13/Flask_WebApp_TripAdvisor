Massive delay at airport - 5 hours of waiting,"Airline lufthansa sold me a one hour transit at Frankfurt, i’ve never been there so i trusted the german airlines to know what they are doing. I shouldn’t have. The security check-in line was at least an hour long (so called speed lane). There were dozens of people there panicking because they were all missing there flight because of this. After i got through the security check-in the airline personel were acting like it was my fault, as if i chose this. They rescheduled my ticket and i got to wait 5 hours at the gate for my next flight. None of the personel felt responsible or got close to an apology.
I’m never flying with Lufthansa again.",November 2019,Lufthansa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729113-Reviews-Lufthansa,World,flights,1.0,4.0
Visit early!,"Everyone in Athens will want to go to Akropolis, ofcourse. To enjoy it the most i advise you to get out of bed early and enter the site as soon as it opens. Then most of the tourist tours will not have started yet, so it will be less crowded. Head straight to the top, so you can enjoy the biggest temples first and you'll be able to get pictures without too many other tourists. You will not regret it. PS, bring as much water as you can, it's probably gonna be hot and it's quite a hike.",December 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Over-stimulating culture of Osaka,"Visit this place to get a taste of the over-stimulating streets of Osaka. It's loud, it's bright and it's crowded.

"Great views, very crowded, museum not that interesting","Osaka Castle is a must-see in Osaka. The Castle is quite big, to get there you have to cross Osaka Castle Park, which is also filled with interesting historical features. A great place to learn about the Winter Battle of Osaka. Inside of Osaka Castle is a museum, which was stuffed with visitors. Only visit this museum if you are really interested in the history of a certain warrior, whose name i've forgotten. If you're not interested, don't bother, you will only be irritated by how crowded it is. You can enjoy the visit to the Castle without the museum.",November 2019,Osaka Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14127623-d320970-Reviews-Osaka_Castle-Chuo_Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,"Chuo, Japan",attractions,4.0,4.0
One of the bigger temple sites in Osaka,"This place is one of the bigger temple sites in Osaka where you can actually enter the temple. If you time it right you will see the monk rituals, which was very interesting to watch. The site has multiple temples and buildings and there is a cafeteria where you can sit and have a calm lunch and a coffee. You'll have an average of two to 3 hour visit.",October 2019,Shitennoji,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298566-d321316-Reviews-Shitennoji-Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,"Osaka, Japan",attractions,5.0,4.0
Spa World,"Great place close to the center of Osaka where you can escape the busy streets for a day and relax your mind and body. A gym is included in the price so you can start your visit with a healthy work-out and after relax your muscles in a sauna. After relaxing you have the option to have lunch or dinner for a good price, and finish your day with a bubble bath and a dip in the cold pool.

Filled with Japanse restaurants,"This area is definitely worth a visit, the streets are filled with japanese restaurants that are not too expensive, extended english menu's and a lot of options.

Fun but not necessary,"If you like old videogames this bar is a fun attraction. I found that the bar was pretty small, with only 4 or 5 game sets available. It's a fun way to meet other travellers, tourists and travellers were the only ones there though. It's a western way of entertainment but it's not the place to go if you want to experience local culture",November 2019,PC and Retro Bar Space Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14127623-d3727432-Reviews-PC_and_Retro_Bar_Space_Station-Chuo_Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html,"Chuo, Japan",attractions,3.0,4.5
