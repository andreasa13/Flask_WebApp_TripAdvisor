What a Hilton should represent,"I really liked this Hilton hotel. Stayed here for only one night unfortunately but I moved into the city centre for the rest of my stay in Istanbul.

Disappointing hotel for a weeks holiday,"You can see from the photo that the first few minutes after we were shown to the room we had booked for our 5 day holiday I was absolutely livid, angry, upset. I demanded a new room, and the only one on offer was the best suite in the hotel. So a few hundred euros later we had a decent room, but still I've got a complaint about it. It is situated behind the bar, the bedroom door is NOT thick enough to prevent you hearing the chatter at the bar.
Thank goodness the weather was good and the beach at the bottom of the road was fabulous
The hotel staff were lovely, the food there was great but guys you have no real idea how to treat your guests if you think putting them in rooms looking out over a building site is acceptable.

Cosy night's sleep,"After staying in a terrible hotel up north earlier this week, a brief stay of one night here again did not disappoint. Arrived at 1am and the receptionist swiftly got me registered and up to my room. Simple parking under the hotel makes life easier and since my first visit 18 months ago they have signage up to identify the hotel in the dark..... hurray

Stayed here three nights last week and couldn't wait to leave the place

A hidden gem behind the shop,"It was at first a typical wine shop but as one walked further into the establishment the back of the store was covered in huge old wine barrels with stools around them. The tapas was some of the best we have ever eaten, each dish cooked to order from a tiny kitchen area. One could buy a bottle of wine in the front of the shop and drink it at the table with different tapas or order by the glass. A must try if visiting Alella.

Great country pub near Oxford,I love the renovations that this pub has had in the recent past. I also liked the response time on online ordering for a recent christmas get together with my family.

Though it would be better,"So we arrived and checked in, given our key and off we walked, quite a distance across the car park to our room. It wasn't ready ! Nothing done since the last guests were there. So back we traipsed to reception. They were nice, gave us a free drink and I had one of the best sandwiches in a long time, while we waited for our room.
Off to the spa later, that was nice, a steam room and jacucci, it was a thursday afternoon and not at all crowded. We went out for dinner and back at the hotel, unfortunately the room had a high pitched buzz coming from some equipment in a cupboard across the hallway from our bedroom door.

The breakfast bar is good and there is parking right outside the front door. I have to praise the staff as well as I left a dvd player there by mistake and a week later the duty manager located it and sent it back to me foc.

Saw some Seals !,"Okay I get that it is posh fish and chips with a view - a fabulous view at that, (and we watched the seals in the harbour to boot), but the food is quite fatty/greasy, and we were quite 'hurriedly' dealt with, even though the restaurant wasn't full. I'd booked a table for 8.15, (last orders 9.30 so no likelihood of having to give up the table after 2 hours!) Our table wasn't quite ready on arrival and so we asked to have a drink on the terrace to look at the menu, which took a bit of persuading to do as the foh staff really wanted us to go straight to the table.

Summer zingy dishes,"What a lovely change to have a restaurant that serves such delicious healthy food. The menu was small in selection but as hard to choose from as a huge menu. The courses are multi dimensional, so on the plate there was a real collection of flavours that made it so enjoyable to savour.

City of Church architecture,"Walking around the old town of Lecce is like going back in time 1000 years. It is so beautifully kept, clean for the most part and the jewel in the crown has to be the Piazza Duomo di Lecce. There is this stunning architecture, outside and inside the church and surrounding buildings and I've added a couple of photos for the first time in my tripadvisor reviews to give a taste of the scene.",June 2016,Duomo di Lecce,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g194791-d1745747-Reviews-Duomo_di_Lecce-Lecce_Province_of_Lecce_Puglia.html,"Lecce, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
DOuble portions,"This place was around the corner from our accommodation in Lecce and looked busy every time we walked passed it, so my wife booked a table for an evening snack. I say snack because we had already had a hearty breakfast and a large lunch, so there wasn't so much room left in my stomach! Anyway we ordered a large plate of meats and cheeses, thinking we could share them together and the platter, when it arrived, I have to admit a little later than I had expected, perhaps 45 minutes, was HUGE. The people on the next table took in a breath of surprise as it landed on our far too small dining table. It did all taste very nice but make sure you're really hungry if you order the large platter. The other issue I had with the restaurant really had nothing to do with the food, but the chairs you had to sit on. Very small wooden slatted garden type chairs, and I had to get up and walk around a bit half way through our visit to get stretch my legs because they were not comfortable at all.",June 2016,Doppiozero,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g194791-d2429138-Reviews-Doppiozero-Lecce_Province_of_Lecce_Puglia.html,"Lecce, Italy",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Great Local food,"We ate outside on the patio which was very nice as the sun went down and the daytime views of the old streets and buildings turned a lovely orange gold into the night with the buildings lit up. The food was nicely local, we had chops of lamb, in strange cuts not seen here in the UK and I'd recommend trying the local starter of a chilled bowl of bread, tomato and herbs. It makes a difference from the bread basket for sure. The only issue that got a little tiresome was the local cat population that decided to camp out under the tables and fight for scraps. If this happens every night I would suggest the restaurant issues each customer with their own water pistols.",June 2016,Le Botteghe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187772-d1098204-Reviews-Le_Botteghe-Matera_Province_of_Matera_Basilicata.html,"Matera, Italy",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Great location for a spot of lunch,"Went up to Bristol for the day and concentrated on walking around the dock area. The layout of this restaurant is very friendly, not too squashed up with other tables and the staff were on the go through this busy lunchtime period. We ate from the daily specials board which was very fairly priced, I ate the sardines and my wife had the asia chicken dish. Good portions and swilled down with a craft beer. We're going to come back and try more sometime soon for dinner",May 2016,Mud Dock Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186220-d731116-Reviews-Mud_Dock_Cafe-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
What a unique place,"Loved everything about this place. The staff were amazing, just wanting to enhance the place somehow, and the cave we were allocated was fantastic. Living, even for 12 hours, in a cave, was an experience to remember. We loved the eco ethics of the place with liquid non plastic soaps and candle light, all very well thought out.
The only issue I guess is the fact that the cave was not on a private section of the hotel itself so keeping our door open let anyone passing by on the public walkway that is within the hotel area, take a look into our 'bedroom' !
So a sign of some sort might help avoid unwanted viewing. Even just keeping our window open allowed people to gaze into our room to take a photo!
But the place IS truly amazing, and the breakfast in the morning was delicious with so much to offer.",June 2016,Sextantio Le Grotte della Civita,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187772-d1234089-Reviews-Sextantio_Le_Grotte_della_Civita-Matera_Province_of_Matera_Basilicata.html,"Matera, Italy",hotels,5.0,5.0
Peaceful hideaway,"We chose the annexe to the main B and B building, located 50 metres away in a quiet alleyway. The advantage was having a terraced roof to share with another room in the annexe but also a kitchenette, fridge and washing machine. The staff could not have been more helpful, especially on our arrival, as they guided us to the location as it's impossible to drive up to it directly. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable.

A surprise in the Abbey,"We walked from central Polignano a Mare to San Vito along the shore on a quest for a pizza! Been in Italy ten days and still hadn't had one. Before finishing the walk we walked around the port, or Marina into San Vito and arriving in front of the Abbey. There were two good looking restaurants on the picturesque little bay and what looked like a run down pizzeria in front of the huge Abbey. We headed there and walked in to this huge cavernous space, it looks amazing inside and you would not think it from the outside, the original monks stone wheels they used for pressing olives are still there. The staff were fantastic, the menu had a huge range of pizzas, unfortunately only served in the evening! So my wife had a plate of bresaola followed by a fish pasta, whilst I had a plate of fried octopus and spring onions. All of it delicious and washed down with Fiano white wine. What a pleasant surprise, and to cap it off we asked them to call us a cab to take us back to Polignano and the waiter drove us back in his car.....grazie mille Luigi !",June 2016,Locanda dei Benedettini,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635875-d2270658-Reviews-Locanda_dei_Benedettini-Polignano_a_Mare_Province_of_Bari_Puglia.html,"Polignano a Mare, Italy",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Five Star raw fish,"The setting of this beautiful restaurant is out of a movie, it reminds me of the beach clubs around St Tropez, but without the falseness and to be fair not quite the beaches!. So we spent a couple of glorious hours slowly eating our way through two delicious courses of food. My wife had carpaccio of fish for a starter and a tuna steak, mission accomplished..... I had the raw seafood starter platter, sea urchin, oysters, mussels, clams, prawns and langoustines, all raw, OMG it was sensational. Then I had cold medium rare beef salad. A decent bottle of verdeca and coffee and sweet bisciuts to finish off. Highly recommend this place for lunch.

A pefect stay,"From the helpful Niko to the perfect continental breakfasts, we loved our too brief 2 night stay at Palazzo Bernardini. Make sure you get Niko, the manager detailed a city map with his great suggestions for great restaurants and tourist visits. One tip I'd like to share is to call in advance if you are in a rental car, as it's not easy finding this place without a city street map.

Don't touch with a barge pole,"Terrible, terrible experience, we stayed there 2 weeks ago for one night, and when we left a brand new tie with label still on it disappeared from the room, we were charged for an extra key, five pounds, we left the other key in the room by accident, funnily that disappeared too. When asking reception for the name of the owners they declined to give a name, when we asked for the name of the manager they declined to give a name. Is this really the way to run a business or treat your clients? OWNERS you should be ashamed of yourselves. The tie cost £20, so why would I make such a fuss if it wasn't for the fact that I feel ripped off. And £5 for a piece of plastic for a key!! It's money for old rope isn't it!!

We settled in and were looked after including a free Birthday treat for our Birthday girl, aged 14, who didn't want the full sing song and cake.

So I was on the 22nd floor, a great view of inner city Birmingham and treated to a free bar and nimbles at happy hour. The staff were great the whole of my stay, and the only hassle I had was trying to get the breakfast chef to cook me a runny egg, when I asked for eggs over easy!!

disappointed,"Over the years from the mid 70's I have stayed at this lovely hotel. It was a hidden oasis with it's beautiful glass elevator, elegant bar and cosy rooms. I revisited it earlier this year and found a quite tired and unloved version. The rooms need a refit, the showers a clean and the carpets replaced. The hidden side bar has been annexed into a coffee bar now. The location is superb, we flew from Bristol, then took the train directly into central station and then walked the 100 meters to the hotel. You can see the Tivolli Gardens from one side of the hotel, so request a room that side, it's quieter. Another tip is go for a higher floor too for a quiet visit. One very unique feature is their famous brass plaques, displayed in the reception area on a wooden column. Each plaque has the name of a famous bnad or artist that has stayed at the hotel.
