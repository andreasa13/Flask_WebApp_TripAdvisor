Fresh as fresh can be,"Just a few steps from the Central Market. In Fact it’s IN the market. We had all fish. Smelt , prawns and squid. All tender and delicious. Also fried eggplant ( it goes by the French name (aubergine) only open 12-6 so plan",November 2019,Taverna Aris,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4761142-Reviews-Taverna_Aris-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
For Athena,"Not much to say about one of the most shared and special places on the planet except to suggest you get.a private guide which we paid $75 for 2 and she walked with us for 3 hours—dont expect 3 hours but you can see it in half that time but the more information you can get from someone who loves and knows Greek history and culture, the better",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Terrific meal,"This was like having dinner with my best friend’s mom cooking. Atmosphere, service, price and especially food quality were first class—we had a great table outside, with a view inside (great live Greek music). We were waited on by 2 servers and the evening was great—I took the server’s suggestion and had the slow cooked lamb dish, which was delicious and fell off the bone—My wife had fresh fish which was also great—they served bread toasted with olive oil, without having to ask. The price, $50, was very fair and I paid that for a meal last night in the Plaka that was mediocre to OK. I give this meal a 10/10.",November 2019,Efcharis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4746098-Reviews-Efcharis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Gateway to DelRay,"My wife found me a place to stay for a 2 day trip to DelRay Beach Florida. I was going to my Aunts 95th birthday and all my cousins and brother were coming in. I also have several good friends near there. This Hotel exceeded my expectations in all aspects from the moment I pulled into the FREE parking right out front till the last experience when the desk clerk called me 5 min after I left to say I'd left my watch in my room. The location ( right off the main drag- Atlantic Ave) is great enough, even if it WASN'T 1 block from the ocean. They have a decent free Breakfast with Quiches yoghurt and fresh juice, free sunscreen, and the pool had sand to mimic the beach. My little room had a great kitchenette with a stocked refrigerator( beer and ice cream) and a big shower. I could go on and on. The Tiki bars, the private patios, the wonderful staff but if you are in the Ft lauderdale area and you can get a spot at this place don't pass it up",July 2013,Crane’s Beach House Boutique Hotel & Luxury Villas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34179-d268246-Reviews-Crane_s_Beach_House_Boutique_Hotel_Luxury_Villas-Delray_Beach_Florida.html,"Delray Beach, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.5
