Visiting in December is cool,"Visiting Acropolis and Athene in December is privilege. Not so many visitors as in summer so it's pleasure walking and not be in river of tourists.
There is discount on tickets and for students from EU many museums and places a free. It's good idea to have prepared some plans for trips outside Athens in case of bad weather. After all very nice experience.",December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Finaly good place and good food,"For readers who use Tripadvisor as guide where to go or not for this place I say GO, GO, GO. After long time in this restourant everything was just perfect. Stuff was exelent and meal was prepared with care so my wife and I enjoited everi moment. If I compare this place with Indian restourant in Tkalčićeva ( wich I like ) this is serius restourant in every way and in Tklačićeva is more like street food. I will go back as soon as I can. All the best for that place.",November 2019,Namaste India,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294454-d14118204-Reviews-Namaste_India-Zagreb_Central_Croatia.html,"Zagreb, Croatia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Rating one of five is too much for disaster and robbery,"If you want to spent pleasant weekend on Sljeme and eat something my recommendation is to avoid Šestinski Lagvić and go somewhere else. Place where in long past was very tasty Croatian traditional cousin today reality is very sad and disappointing. First at all when you sit at you table waiter will bring you couvert without asking so it looks as gift from house. 3 small balls of under average glosbe and watery ham. One per person. For that hardly eatable pleasure at the end of experience ( after you finish your in this particular occasion dinner ) will cost you 25 kunas every ball so in total for 3 person 10 euros. Main course: Duck and ""štrukle"". Duck small parts was ok but bigger pieces where raw an everything was oily. ""Štrukli"" was disaster for everyone who knows what ""štrukli "" are. Disappointment at max.
Final bill at the end was 450 kn ( 60 euros). Tooooo much for all served. After all waist of time for your money. Very sad for place sometimes known of good food.",October 2019,Restaurant Šestinski Lagvić,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294454-d1734793-Reviews-Restaurant_Sestinski_Lagvic-Zagreb_Central_Croatia.html,"Zagreb, Croatia",restaurants,1.0,3.5
