Dry Overcooked Wings,"I was looking for another chicken place to try out and decided to order Chicken Wings from Kelsey’s Roadhouse.

This is the first time I tried ordering from this place. The chicken wings were packaged in a black carton box. Included in our order was a plastic bag containing 3 sticks of celery and a stick of carrot with the blue cheese dipping sauce.

The ten pieces of chicken wings were deep fried but was not juicy. They were very dry and almost tasteless. Without the dipping sauce you won’t taste anything of the chicken.

This is the first and last time I will order from this restaurant. My chicken wings experience was not very good.",April 2021,Kelseys Original Roadhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154982-d976025-Reviews-Kelseys_Original_Roadhouse-Brampton_Ontario.html,"Brampton, Canada",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Just the Average Thai Restaurant,"There are very few Thai restaurants in our city and this is just the fourth Thai restaurant that we have tried since we moved to this city.

We normally order from two Thai restaurants that we had become loyal patrons . I decided to order from Freshly Thai restaurant which is located in downtown Brampton just to compare their menu with these two restaurants that we had been patronising.

I ordered their Freshly Thai Platter which consisted of : 4 vegetable spring rolls,2 vegetable fresh cold rolls, 4 chicken satay, shrimp chips and, green mango salad.
The chicken satay was nicely seasoned and came with a peanut satay sauce. It was good for two persons.

The Thai mango salad is one of my favourite Thai salads and we loved it so much I added additional mango strips after my husband nearly finished all of the mango.
There was some sauce left so I decided to cut some indian mango to go with the sauce.

At $18+++ the Thai Platter was a good starter meal for someone who is just starting to try Thai food . Although Satay is not really a typical Thai dish, I would say the only item that would really be Thai for me is the Thai Mango Salad which was quite good. I would love to order more items in their menu in the future when we are already allowed to dine in.

The packaging could have been improved, when it was delivered it just came in a plastic bag .",April 2021,Freshly Thai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154982-d2242619-Reviews-Freshly_Thai-Brampton_Ontario.html,"Brampton, Canada",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Nice Thai Soup,"We came across this place by chance while out shopping.We went to our favourite sushi shop in the Vaudreuil shopping area but it was closed and right beside it was La Prep.'

Not expecting much from the sandwiches they were offering on their menu for take out I ordered their Turkey wraps.Their wraps and sandwiches came with a choice of either a salad or a soup and I chose a Thai soup which was a Ginger Turmeric Squash Soup. This is the first time we had tasted this kind of soup and it was delicious.

The turkey wrap was not bad either. In fact my husband and I just shared half of the wrap each and it was enough for both of us.

The place is quite spacious but because of COVID dine in is not allowed.We will certainly come back.",April 2021,La Prep,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3213081-d4847849-Reviews-La_Prep-Vaudreuil_Dorion_Quebec.html,"Vaudreuil-Dorion, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Good Value,"This Fish and Chips restaurant is very near to our place and we often wanted to dine in and check it out. However it was only recently that we have ordered food delivery of Fish and Chips from AJ Restaurant.

I ordered a Fish and Chips meal that included a piece of Haddock and fries. I was expecting just one piece of Haddock but maybe the fish was big so they cut it into two portions which made one order good enough to share between two persons.

I actually find the price was good value for the piece of Haddock and fries that came with the order. The only thing I didn't like was the coleslaw which was too sour because of too much vinegar. The batter that coated the fish was just thin enough and crunchy.",February 2021,AJ's Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154982-d681719-Reviews-AJ_s_Restaurant-Brampton_Ontario.html,"Brampton, Canada",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Too Sweet,"This place in Courtney Park in Mississauga is a cafe known basically for their desserts. My son who loves cheesecake brought home a slice of their decadently creamy and delicious Cheesecake.

Their cheese cakes are something to eat after you have gone through a major diet or fasting otherwise you would really feel guilty of having so much sugar overload. It was definitely very sweet which you have to pair with the best brewed coffee.

You have to skip breakfast , lunch and dinner just to have a slice of this decadent cheesecakes from Demetres.The price is a bit cheaper than Cheesecake Factory and the slices are also bigger.

Finally reach the city of Kotor, nested in the very bottom of Kotor bay surrounded by formidable verticals of neighboring mountains.

After Kotor we drove through Vrmac tunnel to the outer coastal part with long beaches and open sea reaching Budva – one of the oldest cities in the whole Adriatic, with charming City Center, and marina for megayachts – today being top tourist destination for younger travelers with all the fun it offers.

When I reached the Acropolis there was already a long queue for the tickets. It took me around 30 minutes to queue up and get tickets. After that we climbed the hilly steep path towards the Acropolis. Along the way I took photos of the view overlooking the city.

Nice View of The American and Canadian Falls,"Thanks to COVID the holidays this year is something we all would remember for having to just stay home because most restaurants are closed and holiday gatherings and celebrations are cancelled.

But despite the impending lockdown on December 26 we decided to spend Christmas in Niagara Falls since we had not been out side our home as a family for almost a year now.We wanted it to be a memorable Christmas this year despite COVID since this is the first time we will actually spend Christmas in Niagara Falls.
The Hilton Niagara Falls is the best location to enjoy a stroll along the route of the Winter Festival of Lights.

Our corner room on the 31st floor (3102) of the South Tower gave us a good view of both the Canadian and US falls.

Our double bed room was huge with a bathroom that had a jacuzzi opening up to the room.

The lobby of the hotel was huge enough to handle hotel guests checking into the tallest hotel between Toronto and New York City . It has 50 floors and with two towers, using the elevator will be a bit of a logistical nightmare if the hotel is full. Luckily because of the COVID lockdown, the place was a bit deserted so taking the lift gave us no problem specially with the social distancing and face mask protocols in place.
My only complaint is the placement of the coffee and tea maker which was placed inside a cabinet. This would make boiling water for tea and coffee a bit difficult because the lighting of the room is dim and you would need a flashlight to see how to operate the coffee making equipment. Most hotels would just place this on top of a table or a cabinet. This is the first time I have seen it placed inside a cabinet that has no lighting inside.

Another problem we encountered is a clogged toilet so we had to call housekeeping to have it fixed.

Quebec and for that matter Montreal is a hot spot for COVID infections so there are no dine in and the hotel has also closed its restaurant and dining area.

Excellent Park But Avoid on Weekends,"This is a huge and popular park which is near the University of Toronto Mississauga. We were here during the weekend and despite COVID there were huge crowds picnicking at the park.
Public parking is available from Dundas Street at the south end of the park and from Burnhamthorpe Road West at the north end of the park which is advantageous if you want to picnic or do some fishing.However totally avoid the park during weekends and holidays if you want decent parking.The park also has a huge picnic area and some even have barbecue pits in them too if in case you want to do your barbecue while having a picnic in the park.

Beautiful Spacious Park,"We were trying to catch the Salmon Run at Credit River so we decided to visit Eldorado Park in Brampton. The salmon migration, or run, up the Credit River is a sign that summer is ending and autumn is around the corner. The determination of these fish is quite a sight. This the first time we had visited this park just to see the salmon migration and now this has become our favourite hang out place.We decided to have lunch at one of the numerous picnic tables dotting the huge park. The park has a children’s playground, camp grounds, picnic areas and a pool.After our hearty lunch we went straight to the river bank to check whether we can see the salmons jumping .Unfortunately we were not lucky to see the salmon run but we saw some salmons in the river.Beautiful wildflowers grow along the river banks which provides a cheery and colourful atmosphere to this area of the park.",September 2020,Eldorado Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154982-d8505186-Reviews-Eldorado_Park-Brampton_Ontario.html,"Brampton, Canada",attractions,4.0,4.0
Secluded Park,"The Meadowvale Park is located in the Meadowvale Consrevation area in Mississauga. My husbands fraternity brother sent him a video of the Salmon Run in this park so after we had our lunch to celebrate my youngest sons birthday we hied off to this park.
Finding the park was a bit tricky because it was located in an area that was unpaved. You have to watch out for the signs along the road because even with the GPS you would have to be on the lookout for the entrance road leading to the Conservation Area.The road leading to the Conservation area as well as the parking lots are unpaved and dusty. But there is ample parking space for the few people who probably frequent this park.Previous to coming here we had gone to Eldorado Park in Brampton to also take a chance of seeing the Salmon Run. We therefore easily compared the difference between the two parks. One is that Eldorado has better signages and has a bigger area compared to this park.It also doesnt have a childrens playground and Pool that Eldorado has.However just like Eldorado, Meadowvale has a lot of space for picnics and trails for hiking or biking. The best part is that it is completely free. As soon as we entered the park we headed straight to the bridge so we could watch fisherman hobbyist trying to catch fish in the shallow river.The bridge that links the camping and picnic areas to the river and walking trails is the main feature of the park. It is long and gives the best vantage point to view the river and the marsh that surrounds the river area.It also leads to the walking trails.You can spot some old trees along the river bend.This park is a bit secluded and probably known only to residents of the neighboring areas. This seclusion is a positive thing because you would have better choice of picnic grounds and ample spaces for parking unlike the popular parks in Mississauga like Erindale Park.",September 2020,Meadowvale Conservation Area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154996-d7058160-Reviews-Meadowvale_Conservation_Area-Mississauga_Ontario.html,"Mississauga, Canada",attractions,3.0,4.5
Excellent Service,"This is the very first time we have dined in this restaurant and we reserved it for a special occasion, the celebration of my son's 23rd birthday.This restaurant is a very popular dining choice of millenials in fact there used to be long queues just to get in the restaurant because they dont accept reservations. They basically practice First Come First Served so we made sure we were early for our lunch .celebration.
Since its basically a Western restaurant and with its sweet specialty of cheesecakes I was looking forward to my cheesecake dessert.
We rarely dine out now because of the COVID restrictions and this is one of the exceptions because we were celebrating my sons birthday.
We were quite early since the restaurant was still serving its Sunday Brunch menu and even some breakfast fares like pancakes and omelet. We however ordered the Beef Asado, Pancrusted Salmon, Spaghetti and Fettucine on their regular menu.
The meals that we ordered was quickly gobbled down and with the excellent service of the crew we didnt have to wait long to order our desserts. My sons girlfriend ordered a banana cream cake while my son and hubby ordered the low calorie cheesecake with strawberries.My son and his girlfriend easily finished the Banana cream cake but my hubby and son didn't expect the Low Calorie cheesecake to be sweet so we ordered it for take out.We received excellent service from the staff.",September 2020,The Cheesecake Factory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d13163915-Reviews-The_Cheesecake_Factory-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Toronto, Canada",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Huge Portions,"We seldom dine in Italian restaurants and in fact this is the first time in years that we have dined in one. Besides its proximity to our hotel, we saw that they had seafood in their menu so we decided to try our first Italian dining experience.

Offering both indoor and al fresco dining during summer, the restaurant has gingham red and white table runners that might remind you of old fashioned soda parlours and Italian restaurants in Sicily.This kind of decor in restaurants like to send a message to customers that it is inexpensive, friendly, and unpretentious. It also suggests that the customer is in a homey place.

We ordered seafood marinara , spaghetti and calamares. Our calamares came first. It was lightly breaded and salted and has that chewy texture.

Both pasta dishes were of large portions and can be shared between two persons. Our orders were served with 4 bread buns. The seafood marinara had a generous amount of mussels and squid but only 4 shrimps and 2 scallops and a few clams.

The restaurant seemed to be famous with locals because there were several customers who seemed to be regular clients already dining in when we came at 6pm.

There were plastic partitions between tables and adequate social distancing and replacement of table runners was being practiced by the restaurant.

Get Good Bargains With Vendors,"This is my 6th visit to this market since 2018 when I first visited it. After several visits I now learn how to navigate the different stores and where to find the real bargains.

I found out that the cheapest vendors(provided you know how to haggle prices) are those who are outside the stalls and who bring their goods on their trucks and cars.These vendors dont have permanent stalls in the market so they can bring the prices down.

I was able to get a vintage table for $8 which I was able to bargain down to this price.It takes several visits to get to know the going rates of items sold here.

We were incredibly lucky because the lavender fields were in full bloom and I couldn't have asked for a better time to visit this beautiful place.

My tip is to be there early (it opens at 10am) because once they fill up their huge parking lot you might be turned away.There was a huge crowd when we got there a few minutes before it opened and when we left an hour later the huge parking lot was almost full.

They were not so strict on observing social distancing rules (as you will see when the visitors are queueing up to get in) and you are allowed to remove your mask when you are already in the field.",July 2020,La Maison Lavande,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1093700-d4559700-Reviews-La_Maison_Lavande-Saint_Eustache_Quebec.html,"Saint-Eustache, Canada",attractions,4.0,4.5

A day before our check in they already sent us a link to check in online and possible to get a digital key so we don't have to pass by the reception to pick up our key.Checking In and getting to our room can all be done online.Because of COVID there is no daily housekeeping service.

The restaurant was closed so meals were prepared and can be picked up at the restaurant area and you can have them to go or bring up to your room.

We ordered their Poke Bowl of Spicy Salmon and Chicken expecting a typical fast food meal.But we were in for a surprise.

The Poke Bowl of Spicy Tuna was bursting with flavours of green beans, and slices of mango that made it really taste delicious.

Needs An Update,"We were visiting Montreal and to my surprise, Marriot hotels in the Montreal airport area has cheaper prices compared to Holiday Inn hotels nowadays. This has never happened for the last 9 years that we have been travelling to Montreal. Residence Inn and the attached Courtyard by Marriot hotels had been charging over $200/night making it one of the most expensive hotels in the Montreal airport area.

The last time we stayed in this hotel was in 2011.After 2011 the prices of both Courtyard Marriot and Residence Inn near the Montreal airport have jacked up their prices to over $200/night.

That's the main reason we have not returned to this hotel until now.
When we checked in there was a group of flight crew from Etihad Airways checking out.Check in however was very fast.

The restaurant and part of the lobby was closed off due to COVID restrictions in Quebec which does not allow people to congregate in public spaces.

We reserved a room with two Queen beds. The decor of this Courtyard hotel has not been as modern as the other Courtyard hotels we have stayed in around the Montreal and Toronto area and even in other overseas properties.

I would suppose they had already done renovations since we last stayed 9 years ago. But the rooms still has the wood head boards which are no longer used in other newer Courtyard properties.I think they need to update their decor to at least be the same as other hotels in the area which have all undergone renovations.

I had high expectations from this stay but unfortunately Courtyard fell short, firstly there were very few amenities in the room (no microwave and the coffee maker was uninspiring and besides that they were lacking waste containers in the room.) Even the toiletries were scaled down.

The only saving grace is their beds and beddings which are one of the most comfortable in the hotel industry. I would probably not stay in this hotel in the near future not until they do an update of their rooms.",July 2020,Courtyard by Marriott Montreal Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g155032-d612721-Reviews-Courtyard_by_Marriott_Montreal_Airport-Montreal_Quebec.html,"Montreal, Canada",hotels,3.0,4.5

Satisfied with Our Take Out Orders,"It was a Sunday and nobody wanted to cook so I decided to order Vietnamese dishes for our dinner.

Pho Lang Viet is a restaurant we haven't tried out yet so I ordered two Phos: a Rare beef,Well done beef and tendon Pho(Pho Tai Nam Gan), well done flank and tripe pho(Pho Nam Sach).

Both of the Pho were delicious and we even got to save some of the broth for the next time we cook noodles.

We also ordered Spring Roll and Grilled Meat with Vermicelli dish(Go Hoac Bo Hoac Thit Nuong).

The portion size of the Go Hoac Bo Hoac Thit Nuong was more than adequate but a little lesser than what we normally eat when we dine in.

The grilled chicken is moist and flavourful. The vermicelli is perfectly cooked. The veggies were crispy. The spring roll was so crispy and delicious. Mix in the fish sauce and it is the most comforting dish in the world.

Since it was a take out order the soup of the pho came in a separate container with the meat and noodles.We were quite satisfied with our orders.",May 2020,Pho Lang Viet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154982-d19097010-Reviews-Pho_Lang_Viet-Brampton_Ontario.html,"Brampton, Canada",restaurants,3.0,3.0

Exciting Tunnel Experience,"I wasn't expecting my DMZ tour to be challenging but it was. We had to walk through a tunnel built by North Korea to spy on South Korea. It was too steep that going up and down the tunnel was very challenging.

In my case I wanted the adventure so I went back to South Korea just particularly for this visit to the DMZ area.I wasn't disappointed specially with the unexpected tunnel walk.

Pricey But Just Infront of Facebook Offices,"This is a great place to live if you work at Facebook and have tons of money. My son was given free accomodations during his first two months of work so he stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment which has a balcony with a view of the Facebook offices. Entry was made through self pick up of the keys to the unit. Due to quarantine regulations all the amenities in the apartment complex were all closed.

The one bedroom unit was clean with full kitchen amenities including cooking wares and utensils, washer.drier, 2 flat screen TVs one in the living area and another in the bedroom. Since its a one bedroom unit it can accomodate only 2 persons or an additional 1 if you use the sofa in the living area as temporary bed. The rents here are pricey so only those who are willing to pay exorbitant rent can afford it.",April 2020,Hamilton by Synergy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32704-d16954978-Reviews-Hamilton_by_Synergy-Menlo_Park_California.html,"Menlo Park, California",hotels,3.0,3.0
