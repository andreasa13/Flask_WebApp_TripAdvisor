Major failure of LIR management: ghastly loud party at 3.00 AM -- Sat 8 August 2020 <!>,"We experienced a terrible management FAILURE on night of Saturday 8 August 2020. Sometimes, there's a bar scene that's a bit noisy -- but that night it was impossible to sleep in the hotel room (OK: nice enough). Cannot quite tell whether it was the multiple ""tents"" up the hill, a rowdy reunion, or a ""party house"" down Fisherman Bay Road -- but the noise was loud, unending, obnoxious, sleep-depriving -- and given WA-mandated COVID restrictions just plain dangerous. Well, to be honest == never coming back again, ever, yuck. Some one ought to report LIR to the county or health agencies. Doubt that the 3.00 am <!!!!> racket (screaming) was ""social distancing"" with mandatory masks -- as per county requirement.

Disappointing -- bland generic pan-Asian food with disorganized service,"If you're looking for ""dumbed-down boring pan-Asian food"" this might be your place -- just beware the catastrophic service, as this place needs to get its kitchen and servers up to speed -- before opening to the public (in its new, former location). They have rushed things, and it shows. Dinner started out promising with mixed greens that actually had interesting tastes. Things went downhill from there. Kimchee pancake had lots of ""cake"" and almost no kimchee flavor (we ought to have departed here). Then, we waited 20 minutes with an empty table. Finally, we asked our server about where our two entrees were. Well, she forgot them; ouch. We'd ordered seaweed noodles in red curry sauce (with crab); we got, instead, bland noodles with not a speck of seaweed in sight, with a salty sauce that strangely resembled their ""other"" noodle dish's. (We think the kitchen simply dumped some crab on someone else's noodles -- what else?) The slab of Pacific cod was, well, salty -- no other tastes. Go elsewhere; anywhere. Don't be disappointed as we were.

OK: the server even let the cat out of the bag, when we remarked that we didn't really have any dish that was Korean. ""Oh, we alter the dishes to suit American tastes"" [you can't make this stuff up !!]",January 2020,Revel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60878-d2192537-Reviews-Revel-Seattle_Washington.html,"Seattle, Washington",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Unusually fabulous Indian food -- lots of interesting menu items for dinner,"Gurmohan Singh Sehra, owner and head chef, works miracles with the standard (wonderful) flavors of north Indian cooking. This place is ""miles above"" the other Seattle Indian restaurants we've tried; there's no greater compliment than to say India Bistro is close to landmark ""Tiffin's"" on Devon Street in Chicago. It was busy during the early evening dinner hour on a Saturday, then things quieted down a little. Lentil-crusted calimari was very good . . . curried mussels were unbelievably delicious (with a home-grown cashew-based<?> curry sauce) . . . and wonderful Jheenga Jalfraizies

"Not a light ""pleasant"" museum visit -- but deeply moving and memorable","The museum, upon entering, has three principal ""axes"" in a broad triangle -- the brilliant axis exile, the disturbing axis of holocaust, and connecting axis of continuity -- and a ""main exhibition"" of Jewish everyday life, the latter was unfortunately closed on this (my) second visit --- and MUCH missed. My first visit: the basement axes force you to confront one of the singular evils of modern times, the creation of a ""void"" that threatened to consume/obliterate the entire Jewish people. The regular main exhibition is an essential and necessary counterweight: it fills the ""void"" that the axes create. Its absence meant I was disturbed and unbalanced and empty; you leave thinking, mistakenly, the holocaust was seemingly successful == Jewish people stamped out. The everyday life is needed for essential reminder of people's determination to survive. The Daniel Libeskind design is simply brilliant.

(My two cents: The controversial and polemical photo exhibition ""This Place"" actually increased the psychic burden: it presents stark and unremitting *conflict* between Palestinians and Israelis -- with scant hope for any possibility of accommodation or change. The book-length catalogue -- unlike the stark exhibit you see -- actually has a few photos with ""green spouts"" [~rebirth] alongside the heavy concrete wall [~death]: here, you can imagine, are possible means for overcoming the cultural, military, and physical barriers. The exhibition's themes of identity, family, homeland, conflict, and the environment divide Palestinian and Israeli families and do not permit ""space"" for kids to play in the streets, or to recognize the musical ensembles that do span the divide. This exhibit, treading on contested terrain, is also heavily slanted in what is ""left out"" and was the occasion for the museum's director to depart -- recognizing a mistake had been made with the exhibit.)",November 2019,Jewish Museum Berlin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d190519-Reviews-Jewish_Museum_Berlin-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,5.0,4.0

Amazing burgers and more,"Galley is our go-to place for dinner. We love their pan-fried oysters, don’t miss the local-caught salmon (if available), and their burgers are simply the best. Mushroom-Swiss is my personal favorite; better half likes the blue cheese. These are “real” burgers with high-quality beef, nice buns, good trimmings.

We were on late side for dinner so it took a couple minutes to clear tables; no problem. Server was attentive and enthusiastic. Sunset that evening was merely breathtaking. We learned—come here for a drink or bite to eat. Two hamburgers were, well, fine; coleslaw a bit goopy and creamy. This is a basic kitchen.

Ursa Minor satisfies,"Fourth time dining here in perhaps a year, and each time Ursa Minor deeply satisfies. We spent more money at a fancy Seattle sea food restaurant, with impeccable service and competent food -- but here there is risk-taking and creativity on the menu and on your plate. Appetizers of raw spot prawns wrapped in kohlrabi and cured smelt with fir tips . . . mid plates of delightful oyster mushroom and incredible cauliflower (with flavorful toasted yeast with creamy thick yoghurt). More traditional entrees of halibut cooked in whey and served with nettles and hazelnuts and then sweet pork belly with tangy fermented cabbage and the fixings. Each dish was delightful, artistic, flavorful, and satisfying. What a place. No wonder that Ursa Minor has collected accolades from Zagat's and a glowing review in the New York Times (15 September 2018):

""That certainly has been the experience of Nick Coffey and Nova Askue since moving full-time to Lopez and opening their restaurant, Ursa Minor, in April 2017. The couple, who wed on Lopez a month after the restaurant opened, have gotten to know plenty of Lopezians, especially those who fish, forage, raise livestock or grow fruits and vegetables.

At Ursa Minor, Ms. Askue handles the front of the house and other aspects of the business; Mr. Coffey’s menu offers a vision of a “creative agrarian Northwest cuisine” that relies heavily on the historic bounty of the island — from lamb, beef and oysters, to orchard fruits, wild berries and garden vegetables — but also on nontraditional ingredients like licorice fern root, cherry blossoms and reindeer moss.

“We’ll use just about anything from Lopez that comes our way,” said Mr. Coffey, who formerly cooked at Sitka & Spruce and other high-profile Seattle restaurants. “Just last week we grilled cattails brought to us by a woman who was digging up a pond.”",May 2019,Ursa Minor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58572-d12512748-Reviews-Ursa_Minor-Lopez_Island_San_Juan_Islands_Washington.html,"Lopez Island, Washington",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A’Town Bistro delights . . .,"Saturday night, it's somewhat quiet in Anacortes, we arrive at A-town just 20 minutes before their closing time. We hope that they'll seat us . . . ? OK: the place is absolutely packed, and the only table is one in the back with room for 7. (We make a small joke about needing only a table for 2, not 22, and the server/seater remembers this on our departure an hour later.) The service, as always, is attentive and knowledgeable, never a hint that there's just 15 minutes until ""quitting time"" . . . .

We have two incredible dishes, each with more flavor than imaginable.

First, ""Pâté A Cappella"" which is delightful:
chicken liver in clarified butter, rabbit liver in local bees wax, duck liver in clarified butter, local mushroom quenelle,dijon mustard, pickled red onions, sauerkraut, cornichons, warm baguette

Second: ""Moules Frites"" which is totally wonderful:
local mussels steamed in a beer broth with garlic, shallots, red pepper flakes, Spanish chorizo & crispy leeks served with truffle fries and yellow curry ketchup. Oh my, oh my, oh my!
I'm thinking what can we possibly do to top this when my better half suggests chocolate garnache with cherry foam and ice.

Each dish is beautiful -- tasty -- memorable. Service was top-rate. What a great place. Since it was late, we nearly tried the local-chain seafood restaurant at the marina, open 30 minutes later; but wow are we glad that we went to the source for Great Food in Anacortes !

Demeter == best bakery in Friday Harbor,"Hands down, Demeter is consistently the best bakery in Friday Harbor. (Well, OK, the soups at Cynthia's across the street are truly excellent.)

(Literally, I was sitting there thinking about that cafe's almond croissant -- why is this reasonable offering such a disappointment to me: because I'd just had Demeter's *almond croissant* two days ago and it was still in my mind!) Savory pastries are crunchy, filled with meat/cheese/veggies -- sweet ones are super-flavorful. The bakers here are masters at their craft.

Central location but disorganized service (esp. for a chain),"One expects better from an established chain restaurant. We wanted, and actually needed, Landry's near Union Station to be a really solid dinner option. Instead, on a Friday night -- and no: not at all over crowded -- we received sub-par service (this needs correction and a manager's attention please).

Dinner was fine: salad was tasty enough (even though 3x lemon juice made it wonderfully tangy but this is not to everyone's taste). Seafood was over cooked (and over salted) and with small-ish portions for the prices. Shrimp with crab had microscopic morsels of crab.

Our server simply had not been trained -- this is what a MANAGER MUST CORRECT (anyone listening?). She was friendly enough but . . . [a] She tried to take my salad away, three times, while I was clearly enough still eating it (not correct pacing). [b] The entrees arrived early but (please!) there's no problem with keeping salad on the table. [c] Very strange for a dinner at a nice place: she did not ask -- anything -- about whether we wanted dessert (not a word such as: ""may I bring you anything else?""), surely an singular event (unless the dessert had problems we weren't to know about --- and that's A Big Problem, too). [d] Worse in a way, the two of us were splitting the simple bill (two beers and two entrees, that's it) and it took three times going back and forth to the credit card machine. In the end, we simply swapped paying for dinners since we didn't have another 15 minutes to wait. It's not the server's fault; it's her manager that didn't train her. Pls. correct ! ! !

Two that were less than stellar were the scallops, done excellently but (please!) a small portion for the price; and the halibut fish tacos, which were breaded and fried -- should be grilled? Several reviews have positively raved about the burrito (have it ""wet"" soaked in sauce): this is an immense creation with everything imaginable -- easily enough to share for two reasonably hungry persons. Roasted beet and goat cheese salad was, well, just what you'd expect: wonderful. The Gado Gado plate is a lighter option, sort of a Bento box on a plate: slabs of fried tofu, peanut sauce, hoison, fresh roll, miso soup, small house salad. Guacamole in the peak summer season exceeded expectations, served with warm chips. Lots of reasons to go back to this great place. Glad to see it thriving!",August 2018,Haven Kitchen & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58572-d7790336-Reviews-Haven_Kitchen_Bar-Lopez_Island_San_Juan_Islands_Washington.html,"Lopez Island, Washington",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Come for the light nibbles, but linger over the splendid selection of accessible wines","Pizza nights are crowded, for good reason: good wood-fired pizzas with great $20 bottles of wine. Selection of paninis and ""skewers"" of various sorts, shrimp cakes were really nicely done. We sometimes joke this is Lopez's semi-pretentious wine bar -- but the wine selection in the small shop is fabulous, local offerings from the San Juans plus around the world, and surprisingly inexpensive: what a treat to have right in Lopez Village. A real addition to the community!",July 2018,Vita's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58572-d819720-Reviews-Vita_s-Lopez_Island_San_Juan_Islands_Washington.html,"Lopez Island, Washington",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Splendid food and attentive service: great downtown spot,"Lechon hit a home run for our dozen-person wedding banquet this week. We booked a special room (in the back and perfect for our modest sized group) with attentive and friendly service by Michael. Food wonderfully exceeded all expectations -- even for this foodie crew. Gaucho bread was rich and garlicky . . . Shrimp ceviche came with avocados and peppers and sauces . . . Spring green and fennel salad was crunchy with radishes and sunflower seeds . . . the lamb chops were heavenly, tender, delicious, perfectly roasted . . . Peruvian roasted chicken (#1 favorite!) was unusual mix adding roasted corn cob slice, sweet potatoes, salsa criolla, and lime . . . Patatas were with charred salsa verde . . . Cauliflower with (get this!) snap peas, pickled cherries, tahini [not too much], and almonds (a vegetarian delight) . . . and the salted chocolate tarte was even a tiny bit spicy. Thanks to Lechon for an impressive meal! Not exactly cheap eats but -- as other reviewers have noted -- this place delivers excellent food and real value in downtown Portland. Certainly ""Worth a Detour"" anytime you are in the PDX area.",June 2018,Lechon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g52024-d8536871-Reviews-Lechon-Portland_Oregon.html,"Portland, Oregon",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A nice walk out to dramatic shoreline -- but check out the parking lot loo (seriously),"Iceberg Point is part of Lopez's quite wonderful national monument, a real gem for nature lovers, birders, walkers of all sorts. The trail is of medium difficulty with only some gentle climbing; if it's been raining, wear footwear capable of puddles and/or muddy spots. Parking at Agate Beach is prior to the trailhead itself. At Agate Beach -- lovely itself -- you will find an unusual port-a-potty described as ""the nicest on all of Lopez"" by one experienced trail walker . . . ""there's even copies of the New Yorker [magazine]!"" Oh, sure, we thought: what sort of place is this where out-of-the-way restrooms have such magazines . . . . NO WAY. But, amazingly, the photos prove the point.",June 2018,Iceberg Point,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g58572-d4522176-Reviews-Iceberg_Point-Lopez_Island_San_Juan_Islands_Washington.html,"Lopez Island, Washington",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great place for drinks on the view-packed patio . . . .,"The view here is to die for across Fisherman Bay -- really, IN Fisherman Bay. Have an afternoon drink or quick lunch here, by all means. But for a nice dinner there are far better options -- Haven (the old Bay Cafe), Galley (right down Fisherman Bay Road), Vita's in town, Ursa Minor if you can get reservations. Islander's Fish and Chips were vastly overly breaded: why, oh why, given the fantastic fish all around? Early season staff were still learning the ropes. Does anyone really need a ""Tiki Bar"" as an excuse to have fun?",May 2018,The Islander Bar & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58572-d1784938-Reviews-The_Islander_Bar_Grill-Lopez_Island_San_Juan_Islands_Washington.html,"Lopez Island, Washington",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Chef Nick delights . . . !,"Chef Nick works wonders with odd-ball ingredients. The menu was intriguing enough to make it difficult for the four of us to choose smaller and larger plates. ""Broth of land and sea"" sounds a bit boring, but what arrived was a cup of clear deeply colored broth redolent of the sea with the deep body and longer taste of the shore: simple, memorable, delightful. Snap peas were almost indecently sweet, balanced by the earthiness of pumpkin seeds, morel, chevre. Salish halibut was our favorite: an ample piece of halibut cooked in creamy whey, with thin slices of asparagus and a hint of horseradish from the spiral-cut turnips. Pork belly was the leanest anyone had ever seen, glazed with a not-too-sweet concoction from the forest. We worried about the rawness of the raw spot prawns, but these were gently delicious, wrapped in a thin slice of yellow beat and accented with horseradish. This was a memorable meal, to say the least. Accessible wine list, with top-shelf options for those with large wallets. Wait staff were attentive without being overly so; graciously answered our multitude of questions. How could any restaurant on Lopez Island be profiled under three Zagat's listings, we wondered? After our meal, we can see why.",June 2018,Ursa Minor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58572-d12512748-Reviews-Ursa_Minor-Lopez_Island_San_Juan_Islands_Washington.html,"Lopez Island, Washington",restaurants,5.0,4.5
great place for oysters in downtown Bellingham,"We went here specifically for oysters, and the place hit three out of four clear winners. Broiled Oysters Mediterranean were broiled in the shell with great complementary onion and feta cheese. Two orders of pan-fried oysters were even better and verging on brilliant: underneath the crisp oysters (of different sizes) was an especially notable cabbage_carrot-pea-pod slaw, where each flavor -- including fresh spring peas! -- was present in a light dressing. Surprise hit of the evening was fried brussels sprouts -- crunchy, caramelized, slightly sweet: Wow!! Slab of chocolate torte with very good coffee. Glasses of chardonnay and sauvignon blanc were nice and generous pours. Sole slip of the evening was disappointing ""oyster stew"" which, it appears, entirely lacked oysters?!?",May 2018,Rock and Rye Oyster House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58350-d6873167-Reviews-Rock_and_Rye_Oyster_House-Bellingham_Washington.html,"Bellingham, Washington",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Clearly best taco shop in the city,"Early votes on are in, and this place is a winner: best taco shop in the city . . . best mexican food . . . Hidden gem. Rush over--now. The menu is tacos-plus with choice of meat (including lengua). Fresh masa made into small tortillas. Friendly service in Spanish and English; eat-in or take-out. A real find . . . we just stumbled upon it.",May 2018,Taqueria Tecalitlan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58350-d14108351-Reviews-Taqueria_Tecalitlan-Bellingham_Washington.html,"Bellingham, Washington",restaurants,5.0,4.5
