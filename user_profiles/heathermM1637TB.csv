Fit for a Goddess,The Temple is impressive and beautiful from afar but awe inspiring up close. It is impressive that it still stands. It commands respect of those who erected such a spectacle.,February 2020,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Feel History,"Not only do I love how the Acropolis looms over the city of Athens, I love how you feel the history as your legs burn on the walk up. Once on top you continue to feel what it must have been like to be in Ancient Greece as you look out over the... kingdom. You are able to walk the steps and touch parts of that history too. There would be no excuse acceptable for being in Athens and not seeing the Acropolis up close.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wonderful Afternoon,What a great end to an Acropolis tour. We booked a small tour with a guide. The museum was big enough to cover the history yet small enough to not be overwhelming. We enjoyed the see-through floor as well as lunch in the restaurant and a browse in the bookstore. The restaurant offers a beautiful view of the Acropolis. Tip: Use your museum ticket to see the ruins underneath the museum.,February 2020,Skip the Line: Athens New Acropolis Museum Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12835132-Skip_the_Line_Athens_New_Acropolis_Museum_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
Peaceful,"Athens is old, full of buildings and concrete so to find a rich green garden smack dab in the middle of it was an excellent surprise. The garden was wonderful to explore and well kept considering some financial stains in Greece.",February 2020,National Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d246658-Reviews-National_Garden-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Learn About,The Piazza and the Fountain of Four Rivers by Bernini became much more interesting this year when we included a walking tour/guide. We visited both the Piazza and the fountain last year but we didn’t know much about the rich history of the either. A private or small group tour is a must.,February 2020,Piazza Navona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190121-Reviews-Piazza_Navona-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
Best Location/Beds,"A+ for Location- steps from Trevi Fountain, near Spanish Steps, multiple Piazzas and the Pantheon. A+ for bed comfort. B+ for service and breakfast. C- for updates needed BUT GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE STARTING SOME REMODELING, specifically on the first floor. Here’s to hoping that they continue on all the way up. Old is charming and historic but our room needed simple fixes if not a complete remodel- like paint on the walls, a hairdryer from the last century and a shower that didn’t leak. You can live with all of it especially because of location, price and service but it will be amazing if they keep the updates/remodeling going that appeared to be happening on the ground floor. Also worth noting, the restaurant is closed for remodeling- not the breakfast room but the restaurant so somewhat inconvenient and not disclosed though our booking (Costco).",February 2020,Hotel delle Nazioni,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d229102-Reviews-Hotel_delle_Nazioni-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0
Best Food I’ve Ever Eaten,"Best Food in Greece. This restaurant was recommended to us by family friends who visited. When we visited we learned it is also a local favorite (not just a favorite amongst tourists). The food was the freshest, most flavorful and mouthwatering of any food I’ve ever eaten! The service was amazingly hospitable- we sat outside. We were shown options, given a tour of the kitchen- treated like family! We ordered after recommendations were made and we were provided additional items to try at no charge! I have favorite restaurants around town but I now have a favorite restaurant around the world! If you are fortunate enough to travel to Athens do not miss this stop.",February 2020,Bairaktaris Taverna Central,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1045578-Reviews-Bairaktaris_Taverna_Central-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Breathtaking,"What an amazing story behind this lake- a beautiful lake with a convenient location along the route to see the Temple of Poseidon. This beautiful lake is tucked just off the side of the road and it is a mix between fresh water and salt water! A natural phenomenon. If warm, it is worth a day stop to swim and eat. If chilly, it is worth an afternoon stop to take in the beauty. Don’t miss.",March 2020,Lake Vouliagmeni,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562635-d1783442-Reviews-Lake_Vouliagmeni-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Vouliagmeni, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
God of the Sea,"The private trip from Athens out to the Temple was a beautiful winding drive along the cost. I love the quieter seasons as I don’t need to see a breathtaking Temple with hundreds or thousands of others to make it special. We went in the early evening so we could see the sun setting. It was worth the drive, the price and the time spent taking in the beautiful Temple and the surrounding grounds.",February 2020,Temple of Poseidon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562628-d312283-Reviews-Temple_of_Poseidon-Sounio_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Sounio, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
An experience if a lifetime,Definitely worth the small group tour price to be able to see the the Colosseum from the ground up. Our guide was amazing- an Archeologist! We bypassed lines and crowds and stayed informed and educated all the way.,February 2019,LivItaly Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d1437747-Reviews-LivItaly_Tours-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Quaint,A little off the beaten path but if that is what you are looking for then it will be perfect for you. Never too busy. Commons area is a charming concept but could use some updating. We’ve been going there for years and the furniture is getting worn. The beds are adequate but could use an update as well to something more heavenly. Pillows to say memory foam should give the room an update without the property loosing its charm. The hotel could be very romantic- no television in the room. Albeit we have only been there as a family.,December 2018,Stafford's Bay View Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g42590-d113666-Reviews-Stafford_s_Bay_View_Inn-Petoskey_Emmet_County_Michigan.html,"Petoskey, Michigan",hotels,4.0,5.0
Cozy,A hidden gem. Cozy and quiet. Close enough to skiing but not as busy as staying at one of the ski resorts. The pool/hot tub is a bonus as is the included breakfast. Pro- Beautiful Views.

Convenient But That's All,"Other than being close to home that's all I can say that is positive. The food, is simply not good. I've tried a large variety and I'm always disappointed. Not really bar food (No Nachos) and not a lot of choices. No daily specials to offer variety and terribly overpriced. I've lived in the neighborhood for two years and unfortunately we end up here often out of convenience. I want to like it, I truly do but I'm constantly disappointed. Offer some specials, talk to your customers and see what they want- I've never ever seen a Manager on the floor talking to patrons in two years. I'm fine with the beer but when I don't want to drink all they offer me is sugar in a can/bottle or water. Their soda/sparkling water doesn't even bubble. On my last visit I tried the calamari which was listed as spicy- and it was by far the least spicy dish I've ever had- in fact I'm pretty sure it didn't have any spice at all. The butter sauce was cold and clumpy and there were- no lie- about 6 or 8 neatly placed/spaced calamari on the plate. The presentation was odd and although I ordered the dish as my main course it was not nor would it have been enough to share as an appetizer. When you are the only restaurant in the neighborhood I guess you don't have to be that good to get customers. It will be interesting to see how they do at the new Rochester location that when I saw I thought goodness I would never drive to or go out of my way to go to a Griffin Claw. I can only hope that the food and variety gets better from what they learn from the new location.",October 2016,Griffin Claw Brewing Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41996-d4565497-Reviews-Griffin_Claw_Brewing_Company-Birmingham_Michigan.html,"Birmingham, Michigan",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Fall Favorite,"Go early if you can- like after breakfast- or the parking gets full and the line gets long.

On our last visit we managed to find a park and get through the line quickly. The donuts were fresh and still warm and the cold cider was spot on. I was not a fan however of the hot cider- it had an odd taste. If your looking for a hot drink, I might try the coffee.

Take a few extra minutes to walk the path/trail along the creek while your there- it will greatly enhance your experience.

A fall favorite that won't disappoint.",October 2016,Yates Cider Mill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g42644-d4992182-Reviews-Yates_Cider_Mill-Rochester_Hills_Michigan.html,"Rochester Hills, Michigan",attractions,4.0,4.5
Home Cooking Comfort,"Amazing home cooking in a comfortable setting which is hard to come by these days. The Moose Preserve serves large portions of original/homemade recipes at a fair price.

On my last visit we celebrated my sons birthday- he can't resist a plate full of warm homemade chocolate chip cookies.

The schnitzel is a new favorite for me and is on their specials menu regularly but I can only hope it makes the next regular menu cut.

Whether to meet a date or to grab a beer after a game or to celebrate a special occasion, The Moose Preserve works!",October 2016,The Moose Preserve Bar & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g42001-d516153-Reviews-The_Moose_Preserve_Bar_Grill-Bloomfield_Hills_Michigan.html,"Bloomfield Hills, Michigan",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Worth the wait!,"We went with the calzone, which was perfectly cooked. Nice fresh dough and it is a bit chewy, which I like. Fresh ingredients too. They had a nice wedge too albeit we had it chopped and they put too much dressing on it but that could be fixed by asking for the dressing on the side next time. I held off on rating a five because the atmosphere is loud and crowded; some nice checkered table cloths could soften up the place and everything was a bit sticky (floor, table, chairs). The place could use a bit of an overhaul especially because it is so busy during the summer I bet they would have time in the off season to spruce it up a bit.",August 2016,Pizza Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g42424-d677742-Reviews-Pizza_Palace-Mackinaw_City_Cheboygan_County_Michigan.html,"Mackinaw City, Michigan",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Over/Under,"We had a chance to go over and under the bridge this year, a first for us. The over part was interesting to me, a grate down the middle and a cement lane on the outside. I wasn't a fan of driving on the grate but when I went to the outside lane I didn't like the way that felt either (like I was too close to the edge). Going under the bridge on a trip to the island was amazing and something I would highly recommend. It gives you such a different perspective. It was interesting and beautiful.",August 2016,Mackinac Bridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g42671-d104191-Reviews-Mackinac_Bridge-Saint_Ignace_Mackinac_County_Upper_Peninsula_Michigan.html,"Saint Ignace, Michigan",attractions,4.0,5.0
Amazing view!,"The fort is fun to visit but be forewarned, you will be sucking wind walking up the steep hill/steps to the entrance. Always something interesting to learn/see and it feels like I get a little something new each time I go. This year, as in years past, we toured the land/buildings and watched the demonstrations. My son is always a different age when we go so I think that helps to keep things interesting. Lunch is worth it because of the view but you are paying the price for the view (just a sandwich and chips). Also, you must see the cannon demonstration, it never gets old.",August 2016,Fort Mackinac,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g42423-d103906-Reviews-Fort_Mackinac-Mackinac_Island_Mackinac_County_Upper_Peninsula_Michigan.html,"Mackinac Island, Michigan",attractions,4.0,4.5
Not for the faint at heart!,200 plus steps to get to the top and a rocky terrain/view from the top! It is worth it if you can make it up the stairs but safety is always a concern when multiple people are heading up and down steps to the attraction when it is hot and you are tired and/or you have kids cutting through adults. A good understanding of what you are in for will make the whole experience much more enjoyable. Safety first. Be careful.,August 2016,Arch Rock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g42423-d277455-Reviews-Arch_Rock-Mackinac_Island_Mackinac_County_Upper_Peninsula_Michigan.html,"Mackinac Island, Michigan",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great beds but breakfast needs an upgrade!,"I was impressed with how comfortable the beds were at this location. I had two decent nights of sleep. I was very unimpressed with the breakfast. No meat was an issue but as someone who wants high protein options and low sugar/carbs I was limited to an egg. Even the cereal was sugary- bran flakes are great but not Rasin Bran, it is chalk full of sugar. I was excited when I figured out there was dry oatmeal but equally disappointed when my only option was a styrofoam bowl. I wanted to use milk to add protein to my oatmeal and there was no way I could heat instant oatmeal in a styrofoam bowl. I also didn't see any sugar free syrup. I get that it is a free breakfast but it needs to evolve to fit the needs of those of us looking for better choices.",August 2016,Baymont by Wyndham Mackinaw City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g42424-d235265-Reviews-Baymont_by_Wyndham_Mackinaw_City-Mackinaw_City_Cheboygan_County_Michigan.html,"Mackinaw City, Michigan",hotels,4.0,4.5
Big Mac,The extra five minutes to swing under the bridge was an unexpected treat and one I would seek out next time!
