Great way to see the island in a day,"ABC Tours did a nice job with this excursion on this cute little island that does not have a lot of major attractions. Brandon, Jose and Harley were happy and worked hard for over 8 hours trying to make sure everyone had fun. They picked us up from our resort and dropped us back off when it was over. There are 8 people that fit in the back of each jeep so it is a little snug but ok. Several jeeps go out together following each other on the excursions. It was not as bumpy or dusty as i thought it might be but it is an open air jeep and you are driving in desert like areas and over lots of volcanic rocks. Most stops are 10-20 min each so the time goes by quickly at each one like the lighthouse, cave, baby bridge, etc. Local lunch was great. You have well over an hour at the beach to relax at the end. I would say this is fun for families and anyone looking for an adventurous way to see the island. Be sure to bring cash to tip the guides at the end.",December 2018,Island Ultimate Jeep Safari,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g147247-d11454756-Island_Ultimate_Jeep_Safari-Aruba.html,Aruba,activities,5.0,5.0
Scavenger hunt through the Vatican with Donato,"Donato was our private guide in Rome as my husband, kids (13 and 10) and I spent several hours touring the Vatican, Sistine Chapel and St Peters. We spent over 3 weeks touring Europe and Donato was our favorite guide of the trip. He was great with the kids. Very knowledgeable where my husband and I learned a lot but he was able to simplify things so the kids could understand. He made the trip into a scavenger hunt with parents vs. kids and stickers to who found the items or answered the questions correctly. This kept them engaged and learning. We would have missed out on many important facts and the real history without him so I would highly recommend this tour for anyone.",July 2018,Rome Tours With Kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d5123988-Reviews-Rome_Tours_With_Kids-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Colosseum History with a guide,"This was our second time to the Colosseum and I am glad we had a private guide as we learned a lot more about the history. I am glad we did the skip the line but also glad we did NOT pay extra to go to the top or underground as I don't feel it would have been worth it. I would recommend to get there early no matter what as it gets hot quickly in the summer. Amazing structure, stunning pictures, a must do in Rome and I would recommend getting the flip book showing what it looks like today and what it did back them.",July 2018,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Dimitris Was Wonderful,"Dimitris was our driver for 8 hours in Athens as we explored the city. I would highly recommend him as a private guide as it is well worth the money. It was my husband, kids (13 and 10) and I. We were able to tour at our own pace and cover a lot of ground with his tour. I really liked how he had videos and pictures in his nice, clean, cool van. He would cover the history while we were comfortably seated and/or driving then we would be able to explore on our own.",July 2018,Dimitris Taxi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12105948-Reviews-Dimitris_Taxi-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Parthenon - Wonderful but crowded,We enjoyed seeing the Parthenon and would highly recommend to anyone going to Athens. Just prepare yourself mentally for large crowds and extreme heat in the summer. Amazing history and wonderful pictures.,July 2018,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Windmills - worth a quick stop,These windmills are great for pictures and good reminder of Mykonos however It doesn't take long to see them nor are they as beautiful up close as I was hoping. Still worth a quick visit.,July 2018,The Windmills (Kato Milli),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g662620-d669289-Reviews-The_Windmills_Kato_Milli-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Beautiful but busy,"Loved the history here but very, very busy so prepare for crowds and the heat. I personally liked the Parthenon as much as it wasn't so hectic",July 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Educational experience through Athens,"Dimitris did a wonderful job with our tours of Athens. Very educational and fun. He knows his history well yet made it fun for the kids. He did a great job driving around the city and avoiding traffic and the lines/long wait times. I liked how he had pictures and videos in his van to explain the sites before we went in. This helped us stay cool, hydrated and resting between the many sites. His van is very clean and the air conditioner works great. Great local restaurant for lunch as well.",July 2018,Tours By Locals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d13656625-Reviews-Tours_By_Locals-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
