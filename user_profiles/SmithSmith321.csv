Lovely dinner out,Excellent dinner out with my partner. The food was quick to arrive but quality wasn’t compromised and the staff were all masked and taking all relevant covid precautions to ensure we felt safe. All courses were excellently presented and we would definitely go back. Thank you.,August 2020,Galleria Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186225-d1316853-Reviews-Galleria_Restaurant-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great day out,Me and my partner went to the Acropolis today and really enjoyed it. There are a number of sights to view in a small space so although there is a fair bit of walking to get to the main area it was well worth it. The staff are friendly and were ensuring that everyone was socially distanced and following the one way system. We didn’t get a guide as we wanted to go round on our own time but there were plenty of guides keen to help if that’s your thing.,October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Dinner out,Lovely dinner out. The waitress was so polite and helpful and explained the menu to us in perfect English. We were sat outside the restaurant in the street which was quirky but lovely to take in the surroundings. Food was excellent and came out quickly and well presented. Would recommend.,October 2020,Atlantikos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7176555-Reviews-Atlantikos-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Perfect stay,"Just finished a 5 night stay at the Grand Hyatt and both my partner and I have been extremely happy. The hotel staff are so friendly and helpful (especially the people at breakfast who plate your food for you and ensure that you’ve always got a hot drink). The people on reception are also so kind and helpful and always gave us advice of where to go etc. The rooftop pool is nice, clean and tidy and staff regularly were cleaning the beds once people left. Our room was very spacious with a huge king size bed. Our only critique would be that the mattress is pretty firm and the pillows a little soft but that’s a personal preference. The air con was really good too even on the hottest days. The maids were so friendly and did a great job tidying our room for us. The bathrooms are very modern and the shower really powerful.
The location isn’t the best (right off a main road albeit you can’t hear it as the rooms are very much sound proof) but once we started exploring we realised we were only a half hour walk from the Acropolis and about a 10 min walk from the tram line which takes you to loads of cool bars / restaurants and then further on to the various beaches.
We would highly recommend and definitely would stay here again if visiting Athens again.",October 2020,Grand Hyatt Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15009871-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0

afternoon tea,"I pre-booked an afternoon tea and whilst on the phone was told that no one else had pre-booked. When arriving, a table not overlooking the canal had been reserved for me. I was disappointed that walk-ins would take priority over someone who had made the effort to pre-book. Besides the placement, I was happy with the food and the staff were very friendly.",April 2019,G & Tea Leaf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2149132-d13991642-Reviews-G_Tea_Leaf-Foxton_Market_Harborough_Leicestershire_England.html,"Foxton, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
