Excellent hotel close to port!!,Only stayed here one night but it was great! Walking distance to ferries and to local buses. Very friendly staff and breakfast that was included was amazing!! Definitely the best bed of all the hotels we stayed at in Greece.,September 2018,GDM Megaron Historical Monument Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189417-d296465-Reviews-GDM_Megaron_Historical_Monument_Hotel-Heraklion_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Amazing view of caldera!!,"My husband and I got married here and spent a couple of nights in a suite as well.

The staff are amazing and offered us free champagne upon arrival! On the day we left, our ferry wasn’t until 5pm and they gladly kept our luggage and let us use the pool all day. There is always someone available 24/7 which was really helpful.

Breakfast is included and they offer more of a “Greek-style” breakfast with coffee, tea and juice, hard boiled eggs, different styles of bread and pastries, fruit salad, variety of cakes that change everyday and a meat and veggie tray.

The view is amazing from everywhere at Villa Irini and the sunset is breathtaking.

We can’t wait to come back and visit again :)",September 2018,Villa Irini Santorini,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d1158135-Reviews-Villa_Irini_Santorini-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Close to train station and very friendly staff,"We visited Meteora in early September and this place was perfect! 40 euros/night, less than 5 minute walk from Kalambaka train station and very friendly staff. They offered us a room upgrade and held our luggage after check-out until our train at 5pm. Bed was ok and bathroom was typical for Europe but the A/C was great. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!",September 2018,Hotel Galaxy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315843-d12593492-Reviews-Hotel_Galaxy-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great authentic Mexican food and amazing views!,My husband and I were staying nearby and decided to try this restaurant and we were not disappointed. We shared the chicken fajitas which were amazing and a pitcher of sangria. All portions are very generous and we were quite full afterwards. The views alone are worth a visit but the food makes it even better!,September 2018,Senor Zorba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1097549-d1867523-Reviews-Senor_Zorba-Pyrgos_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing swimming!,Great idea to walk down the steps for a swim. The water is amazing and you can jump off the rocks. Minimal space to sit but it’s totally worth it. Bring water shoes if you have them!,September 2018,Amoudi Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482941-d1223227-Reviews-Amoudi_Bay-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A definite must while visiting Santorini,"We stared from Fira around 10 am (we tried to wake up earlier but we are not morning people) and made it to Oia in less than three hours. We are quite active and stopped several times along the way to take pictures. I’d recommend going down to Amoudi Bay for a swim once you get to Oia, the water is amazing! Wear good shoes, bring water and snacks although there are places along the way to stop.",September 2018,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d2368798-Reviews-Hiking_Trail_Fira_Oia-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Not as busy as expected!,We visited early September and were prepared to wait in line. We visited around 3pm and there were no lines! Definitely being water as it is quite hot and there is minimal shade.,September 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
View from the top is breathtaking!,"My husband and I visited Zakynthos mostly to visit Shipwreck beach. We arrived a couple days after the rock fell onto the beach so the access point was closed. We decided to drive up anyway and surely the police are blocking the access road. It is still possible to park at the monastery nearby (St George Kremnon) and hike down to the access road in order to see the viewpoint. This was a highlight of our three week trip to Greece. We also did the boat tour but since we weren’t able to swim, it was a little disappointing. The view from the top was much better than the boat tour. Since the beach is empty, the pictures are amazing!!",September 2018,Navagio Beach (Shipwreck Beach),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g7777607-d671779-Reviews-Navagio_Beach_Shipwreck_Beach-Anafonitria_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great value and close to Fira centre,Visited with my husband for four days in early September. Very close to main square in Fira and owners are very friendly. Clean rooms and modern bathrooms. We arrived on a very early flight and they let us leave our luggage and lounge by the pool until our room was ready. They even gave us a choice of rooms as we were the first to arrive. The organized a taxi to our next hotel and we would have appreciated a free ride as we didn’t use the free shuttle on either occasion. Would stay here again!,September 2018,San Giorgio Villa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d590947-Reviews-San_Giorgio_Villa-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Amazing tour group! Definitely use them,"Husband and I booked the shipwreck/blue caves tour and even though shipwreck beach was closed, it was a lovely tour with a small group. Tour guide Steve and the captain of our boat were both great. When the day was over, they even offered us a bottle of wine for our honeymoon!! The ladies at the head office must have remembered, amazing service !!",September 2018,Nefis Travel - Private Day Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g775851-d1911182-Reviews-Nefis_Travel_Private_Day_Tours-Tsilivi_Planos_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Amazing dinner and very friendly owners,If you are staying in Laganas or even elsewhere in Zakynthos this restaurant is worth a visit! We came here three times during our 3 day site and highly recommend the moussaka and beef stamna. Owners are not pushy like other restaurants and are very friendly. They offered us a fruit plate on the house both nights :),September 2018,Sanpiero,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g658915-d4581787-Reviews-Sanpiero-Laganas_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Amazing building!,Visited mid September and entered right away. Amazing building from both the inside and outside. Definitely worth a visit !!,September 2018,Pantheon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d197714-Reviews-Pantheon-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Not worth 17 euro ...,"Went in mid September around 2pm and had to wait in line about 30 minutes. If you are a student (even outside of the EU) and 25 or under, tickets are half price (8 euro instead of 17). Make sure to bring student card and passport! The museum was absolutely jam packed with tour groups which made it less pleasant. After entering Sistine chapel, we were forced to exit and you cannot come back in. I think this was unique to our visit because it was SO busy with tours. If you are pressed for time, I would just visit the St Peter Basilica.",September 2018,Vatican Museums,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187793-d191000-Reviews-Vatican_Museums-Vatican_City_Lazio.html,"Vatican City, Italy",attractions,3.0,4.5
Amazing!!,"We visited the Vatican museum, Sistine chapel and St Peter Basilica and honestly this was our favourite part. Building is absolutely breathtaking. Entrance is free however the security lines to get in are quite long. We got lucky and we allowed right into the basilica from the Sistine chapel even though we weren’t on a tour. Definitely worth the visit !!",September 2018,St. Peter's Basilica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187793-d631111-Reviews-St_Peter_s_Basilica-Vatican_City_Lazio.html,"Vatican City, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great visit!,Visited in mid September and didn’t have to wait long to get in around 2pm. We bought our tickets from the Roman Forum and they were 12 Euro/adult and included entrance to Colosseum. Ticket is valid for the next day as well. No need to buy skip the line tickets. Wouldn’t recommend a guided tour unless it is private. The groups are quite large.,September 2018,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing food!!! Visited twice in one day!!,My husband and I went here for breakfast and didn’t see any breakfast items on the menu but the owner/chef quickly offered us his eggs and bacon and it was amazing!! We saw other people ordering pasta as it was close to lunch time so we came back for dinner and had the pesto gnocchi and it was delicious. This place is family run and they are very friendly. Food is fresh and delicious for a great price :) We would highly recommend visiting this restaurant when in Rome!!,September 2018,Sfiziarte - The Art of Food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d10546545-Reviews-Sfiziarte_The_Art_of_Food-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,5.0
