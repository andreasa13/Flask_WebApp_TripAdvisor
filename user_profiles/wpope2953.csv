Best Meal we had in Greece,"We were staying in a nearby hotel, and wandered in by foot to find a place to eat. Greeks eat normally later in the evening than we do, so we literally had the resturant to our self. So the service was great with ocean front seats. The food was amazing, the portions were huge and the prices were reasonable. Great feel, I actually wish we could have been there when it is was full to get the full experience of the room crowded, but was great nonetheless.",February 2020,To Korali,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2184506-d6740501-Reviews-To_Korali-Artemida_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Artemida, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful setting,"We just wandered to the grounds as they closed, so we didn't get to see the museum - but the temple is located in wetland so there is a great walking trail that leads back to the temple. Even though it was closed you could see it from the fence, if we had more time we probably would have wandered back but too much to do, not enough time.",February 2020,Temple of Artemis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1189587-d2540033-Reviews-Temple_of_Artemis-Vravrona_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Vravrona, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
So much potential wasted...,"I recognize some of the things I will put in this review will seem nit picky, but they were the things that struck us that had we known we probably would have heavily reconsidered staying here, so why I share them here...

First of all, this had the charm and appearance to be a nice hotel. The common areas inside the hotel are beautiful. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable, and you can tell they were recently renovated. It is an older hotel, so we had a couple problems with the electrical (lights, etc.) but the hotel was responsive in fixing them immediately. We were there in the off season, so the outdoor areas were closed off and there was a lot of construction for preparations of the upcoming tourist season - that's understandable though, but I can't say what those facilities are like because of it. Also be aware the room walls are REALLY thin. We literally could listen to the conversations of the couple in the next room, which wasn't as bad as the fact that we could hear them in the bathroom too (nothing like being woke up at 4am listening to some stranger in the next room peeing into the toilet)... which means they could hear us too, luckily we never ran into each other so we could be embarrassed together.

The customer service was inconsistent. There were some employees who went out of their way to make you feel welcome, and there were there that looked at you as being just another interruption to their day. For example, we asked to move to a water view room, and the response was ""No"". No explanation, no ""sure but an additional charge"" (which we would have paid) it was just ""No"". This was even more odd since we spent a week there and the hotel was a ghost town, we never saw more than 2 people in the restaurant at any given time. While others, were genuinely interested in how we were doing what we did during the day, what we saw, and took an interest in us as a customer and guest.

The spa prices seem out of line for services provided to prices we are accustomed to, but the spa does provide full services, but we did not use the spa so cannot comment on it.

We had two meals at the restaurant, a dinner service and a breakfast service. The dinner menu offers a good variety of Greek dishes, with some other cultural foods beyond Greece for more picky eaters. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't knock your socks off either. Just standard fare really. Breakfast was a buffet, but was mainly pastries and breads, yogurt (typical Greek breakfast), with 1-2 hot items (egg and bacon). The food wasn't bad for this either, but for 10 euro each we expected more variety than a couple 0.50 euro pastry if you bought it at the store down the street from the hotel, scrambled eggs and bacon.

The hotel grounds is right on the water, but the actual building to where the shoreline is, is not very close. If you go out the hotel, you walk down a hill to get to the shoreline - I didn't really estimate the distance but it took a minute or two to get to the water so it's not a short walk. Also be prepared, you'll have to walk back uphill after spending the time in the sun/water.

For being an ""upscale Wyndham Resort"", we were not expecting to be ""nickle and dimed"" for everything. The use of the indoor pool was an additional charge (20 euro), even though exterior pool was closed, breakfast was an additional charge, and so on. In itself wasn't a huge deal, but would have been nice if all of that was disclosed at booking. I guess we just expected more from our other Wyndham stays.

Finally this hotel, is not near Athens proper. If you stay here, you can expect a 30-50 euro transfer each direction, or a two hour bus trip. If you're daring enough to rent a car and drive in Athens, that will be your most time/cost effective way to get from this hotel into Athens proper. So be prepared for the transfer costs, or other options.

Where the hotel is though is right at a Delta, where fresh water river meets the sea. So provides some beautiful views, and a lot of wild life. The town of Vravronas is within walking distance, and has some great little shops, beach access, and restaurants (in fact one of the best meals we had during our time in Greece was right near the hotel).",February 2020,Dolce by Wyndham Athens Attica Riviera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1189587-d250607-Reviews-Dolce_by_Wyndham_Athens_Attica_Riviera-Vravrona_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Vravrona, Greece",hotels,2.0,4.5

So much information,"There is a ton of information, and great examples of ruins from the Acropolis that you can get up close to.

"Athena, the goddess of Wisdom, says ""take this tour""","This was our first stop in Athens. We figured, we needed to have someone walk us through the history of this place before we struck out on our own - and one of the best decisions we made on this trip. Our tour guide was great. Very laid back, and attentive. Spent a lot of time providing us great historical context of the sites of the tour, and how the mythology of antiquity has blended into Athens culture of today, and even into the world. The tour included explanations over the various gods/goddesses in Greek mythology, and the temples/ruins dedicated to them - including what life would have looked like back then. There was no shortage of information, and our tour guide went into detail for any of the questions that our group threw at her - I don't think any of us left with an unanswered question, but we all left with more knowledge than when we started - and also provided my wife and I the building block on what we wanted to spend more time looking at during our time in Athens, and how to create the plan to accomplish all of that!",February 2020,Athens Highlights: a Mythological Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11471294-Athens_Highlights_a_Mythological_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0

A Palace you have not even fathomed...,"Much of Rome's ancient city, you have to use your imagination to see what it would have looked like all those centuries ago - but you cannot deny the awesome size and intricate detail (such as floor mosaics still in the ground surrounded by grass now) - much of which has only been uncovered in the last 50 years - imagine what you will see when you go back next time?",February 2020,Palatine Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190996-Reviews-Palatine_Hill-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Bucket list location... check,"We went here in the tourist ""off"" season, and it was crazy busy. I cannot even fathom during the busy season what it would be like, but the only way to make it through sea of people would be through a skip-the-line tour. Our guide was Giuseppe, and he was great. Had a ton of information, personal stories along with the history tied everything together while getting us in and focusing our attention on the whole experience. It seemed rushed at some parts, but the things you can't miss on the tour (St Peters, Sistine Chapel, etc.) you will have plenty of time to see. If you want to go back into the museums after the tour, you can so you can spend more time on the things that interest you that may have seemed rush - but the tour will give you the roadmap to allow you to know what you want to see, and what you don't want to see.",February 2020,"Faster Than Skip-the-Line: Vatican, Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica Tour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187791-d11449807-Faster_Than_Skip_the_Line_Vatican_Sistine_Chapel_and_St_Peter_s_Basilica_Tour-Rome.html,"Rome, Italy",activities,5.0,4.5

Walking on the road of antiquity,"Literally you are walking on the road that predates Christ.

One of many must see...,"I would suggest the skip the line tours that are out there, espeically in the busy tourist season. You can get through on your own, but it's nice to get a local perspective on the site and learn their history from their perspective not from what we read in a book. Not standing in line is a plus.
