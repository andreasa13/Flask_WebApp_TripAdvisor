Location and service is only reason for even 2 stars,"This was our first day in Greece and I wish it wasn't our first meal, because it didn't give me hope that Greek food was as delicious as it's rumored to be. I ordered an omelette with tomato and cheese, no bacon and got an omelette with bacon, no cheese. I could have asked them to remake it, but the first bites of it were so bad (and cold) that I had no interest in doing so. I then asked for a fruit salad and was again disappointed. It was fruit from a can, fake syrup and all. Canned fruit in Greece. What the heck.

The saving grace was the location of Mikel's. It's right on the main walkway along moored boats - and there are shaded tables to make sitting outside comfortable. The server was very friendly so that was a plus.

I would not recommend this coffee company. I would find the hidden gems along the side streets for a more authentic and edible Greek breakfast.",September 2019,Mikel Coffee Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6495956-d10802397-Reviews-Mikel_Coffee_Company-Lefkada_Town_Lefkada_Ionian_Islands.html,"Lefkada, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Layered Blue Hues of Sea,"Ah, what a scenic beach! The drive down the hill to the beach has lots of switchbacks, but taking it slowly gives passengers in the car plenty of viewing opportunities to the beach below. There's not a ton of parking, but we went a little later in the day so we found a spot.

The beach is sandy...until you get closer to shore and then it's limestone so you should bring swim shoes. I wore closed Tevas and the rocks still found their way in making it really hard to walk. Limestone feels like quicksand so, between that and the bits of rock, if you aren't sure-footed to begin with, definitely bring a friend to help you get out of the surf. If I hadn't done that, I might still be there!",September 2019,Myrtos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189457-d645368-Reviews-Myrtos_Beach-Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great way to pack in lots of sights,"With only a day to explore Athens, this hop-on hop-off bus made life so much easier, especially since I had injured my knee. There are several convenient stops along the route and you can just take as much (or as little) time as you want at any particular point of interest. I wouldn't have been able to see as much as I did if I didn't use this bus tour. Highly recommend.",September 2019,City Sightseeing Athens & Beach Riviera Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11448070-City_Sightseeing_Athens_Beach_Riviera_Hop_On_Hop_Off_Bus_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.0
Unmatched Ionian Islands Sailing Adventure!!,"I recently traveled to Greece with a group of friends to go on a chartered sailing adventure and it surpassed any and all expectations. It's not hard to fall in love with all the beauty Greece has to offer, but a great sailing vacation (even in Greece) can be dampened by a less than stellar boat charter or skipper. I was beyond thrilled that my experience with Greek Island Yacht Holiday, by far, made for the best vacation of my life!

The captain, Walter, was an expert in sailing and knew all the good places to explore, both on sea and land. Most importantly, he took the time to understand what we wanted out of our vacation and helped develop an agenda that, combined with his local knowledge, maximized our time there. And we made changes along the way depending upon what we felt like doing or seeing, which wasn't a problem at all. He emphasized it was our vacation and he made everything happen. Walter was the perfect guide â€“ super friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating.

We mixed great sailing with docking at villages that provided us with local culture and we even rented a car one day to go further inland to see some sights on our list. When we wanted a break from the docks, we anchored, made dinner on board and enjoyed the quiet. I didn't sleep inside the entire week. I slept on deck so I could look at the clear skies and brilliant stars.

I can't recommend Walter and his company highly enough and can't wait to go back next year!!",September 2019,Greek Island Yacht Holiday,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d19115942-Reviews-Greek_Island_Yacht_Holiday-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
My favorite harbor of the island!,"We came in by boat and it was a little challenging finding a spot to moor. That said, the limited number of boats is one of the reasons it was so enjoyable. It is beautiful, with small, colorful shops all along the waterfront and plenty of eateries with umbrellas for shade. For breakfast, I had the local Kefalonia yogurt with honey and it was the best yogurt I have ever had! Quaint all around. Highly recommend.",September 2019,Fiscardo Harbor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g776022-d10731564-Reviews-Fiscardo_Harbor-Fiscardo_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worth the walk up,"It's as majestic as they say and nothing compares to seeing the grand structures up close and personal. I would recommend going at an earlier time before the buses of tourists come in and the temperatures rise. I would also recommend entering the grounds through the pedestrian bridge versus the main bus entrance.

Bring lots of water and wear light athletic shoes that have some grip as many walking stones are slippery (like marble). I wore running sneakers and found that they were too hot. They have a couple of water bubblers near the top so you can refill your water bottle so you don't have to carry a mammoth bottle from the start.

We lucked out because it was World Tourism Day and everything was free! Even if we had to pay, however, it would have been worth it.",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
