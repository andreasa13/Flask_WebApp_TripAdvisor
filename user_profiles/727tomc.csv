Best Thai in HB,"We come here a lot since we live close. Always get the yellow curry, though. It is as good as any Thai restaurant I've been to. Also tried the BBQ combo for the first time, and it was so tender, moist and tasty.",October 2019,Thai Wave,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32513-d850066-Reviews-Thai_Wave-Huntington_Beach_California.html,"Huntington Beach, California",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Wonderful Italian Food,"Went on a Sat evening, and the place was packed. Seated at a cozy table upstairs, we had a bottle of wine and dinner. Most everyone at the bar was also having dinner. Their lasagne is amazing!",February 2019,Cucina Alessa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32513-d1535602-Reviews-Cucina_Alessa-Huntington_Beach_California.html,"Huntington Beach, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Wonderful lunch visit in Ampelas!,"Wonderful staff, and the food could have been better and so much more affordable than the harbor at Nouussa! Fish, greek salad, appetizers were all superb, and the beer was cold! We happened to find the location, but you have to travel 200 meters from the main road to find the restaurant. If you are on scooters, this is the place for lunch.",May 2019,Margarita Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6122981-d4953567-Reviews-Margarita_Restaurant-Ampelas_Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Perfect resort!,"We arrived and were upgraded to a partial sea view room. The room was immaculate and had plenty of storage, comfortable bed, and a great view from the balcony. Even better than the room was the staff...everyone was so nice and helpful, from Nicos (both of them) to Kula, Mike, and Yannis. We absolutely loved the resort and would recommend to anyone! =",May 2019,Saint Andrea Seaside Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g642170-d1500574-Reviews-Saint_Andrea_Seaside_Resort-Naoussa_Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Walking self tour,Get your steps and walk the entire Acropolis area. Amazing historical site. Early May is best as the crowds are light and we has nice cool breezes.,May 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Spectacular visit,"We initially looked at staying at the Hotel Grande Bretagne, but the Electra Palace was much less expensive and closer to the Acropolis and closer to the Plaka area of restaurants and shops. Our room on the top floor had amazing views of the Acropolis and was cool and comfortable. The rate included a good breakfast, and fruit/wine delivered daily. Staff were all pleasant and helpful. If we ever return to Athens, we would stay here again!",May 2019,Electra Palace Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228901-Reviews-Electra_Palace_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
"I live here, so of course it's sweet!","I'm walking on main and the pier/boardwalk most every morning and night. Lots of good food, sports bars, and entertainment. A bit noisy on Fri/Sat (or when the US Open is in town). But a great place to live and play.",November 2017,Downtown Huntington Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32513-d3382703-Reviews-Downtown_Huntington_Beach-Huntington_Beach_California.html,"Huntington Beach, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best breakfast,"Everyone lines up for breakfast, so get here early on weekends. Everything is good, especially pancakes. No Ka Oi has great eggs benedict (many styles)...that's the best alternative to Sugar Shack if it's crowded.",November 2017,Sugar Shack Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32513-d468005-Reviews-Sugar_Shack_Cafe-Huntington_Beach_California.html,"Huntington Beach, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Awesome burritos,"Carnitas, carne asada and machaca are my go-to. Authentic food.

Great hangout next to the pier,Great place to grab a snack and a cold one and catch a game or watch beach volleyball. The ceviche is great (and low cal). Great brew selection and atmosphere.,October 2017,Sandys Beach Shack,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32513-d343899-Reviews-Sandys_Beach_Shack-Huntington_Beach_California.html,"Huntington Beach, California",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Go for the Rise and Grind,"The Rise and Grind is definitely my breakfast go-to. Bomber or Greatfella for lunch.

Fantastic location and staff,"My wife and I spent a week here, and the service is fantastic! Iris checked us in and gave us a stunning 2BR room with beach/ocean views. She was so helpful and we breezed through check-in. The room was so nice that we spent a full day just lounging in the sun on the balcony. The kitchen was well-stocked, and the beds couldn't have been more comfortable. We both slept so well this vacation. And the hotel is just two blocks from the supermarket, so we picked up some beautiful steaks and cooked them on the gas grill available at the hotel. The room was perfect when we returned each day. We'll be back soon!",March 2017,Villa Del Palmar Beach Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150793-d154769-Reviews-Villa_Del_Palmar_Beach_Resort_Spa-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
Perfect lunch spot,"Very few tourists in here...lots of locals. The menus are authentic Mexican, and salsas are great! I had a tamale; perfect masa! And we also enjoyed the ceviche. Made just the way we like it with white fish.",April 2017,El Andariego Restaurante Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150793-d1032978-Reviews-El_Andariego_Restaurante_Bar-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great location, marginal food and drinks","Great view of the pier and downtown. For great Mexican food, you're better off going to Avila's El Ranchito down Main Street. Recipes are bland at Fred's, and drinks are marginal. The spill tray for mixed drinks is right above the ice bin, and I've seen bartenders ice-down beer bottles in the drink ice. Just not a top shelf operation.",June 2015,Fred's Mexican Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32513-d467916-Reviews-Fred_s_Mexican_Cafe-Huntington_Beach_California.html,"Huntington Beach, California",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Best people/dig watching,"Our home is a 5-minute walk to this beach, and we're there every week. You can see the excitement in every dog as they approach the sand. Every is very good about cleanup, and if you love dogs, you'll have a blast taking a walk here.",August 2015,Huntington Dog Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32513-d578943-Reviews-Huntington_Dog_Beach-Huntington_Beach_California.html,"Huntington Beach, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wonderful resort,"We just spent the past week at the resort, and couldn't have had a better time. Lots to do there, and the staff, from the front desk to waiters and bartenders, were excellent. We signed-up for the all-inclusive plan for 3 days, and I don't know if I would do that again. The food was all good, but it was nice to get out to Lorenzillo's and local taco shops for real Mexican food. The tacos de pescado and al pastor we had a downtown stands were the best ever. If I could recommend anything to the resort, it would be to bring more local Mexican dishes to their menu...I don't go to Mexico to have pasta. And visit Russell at STK or the beach for unique shots.",October 2014,Villa Del Palmar Cancun Beach Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d1917247-Reviews-Villa_Del_Palmar_Cancun_Beach_Resort_Spa-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent lobster and staff,Food was excellent and the restaurant is beautiful. I would go here again...sit outside if possible.,October 2014,Lorenzillo's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150807-d787079-Reviews-Lorenzillo_s-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Spectacular week,"This was our second stay at this resort, and was perfect. We had a wraparound balcony in building 3...highly recommended. Best view on the property. The fitness center and spa are now open. The staff couldn't be nicer. Had a 80 min massage for $100, and was exactly what you would get at a nice spa in the US. Facilities are great.

Every meal was great, especially the Al Pastor tacos and the pizza. Luis had the chef make us a true Mexican style cóctel de camarón. All fresh ingredients, and was perfect. We did go into town the first day and pick-up some fresh breakfast food and fruit. Even the new store on site has greatly expanded their stock, and the prices are very reasonable.

Manny and Roberto are the best...always with the biggest smile and best service. The 90 minute owners update was enjoyable. The resort is just going to get better and better. We'll be back again next year and will bring friends.

Only suggestion to the hotel would be to add bosu and exercise balls to the fitness center...inexpensive way to add to everyone's workout. And once they get wireless to the rooms and improve network performance, we'll be set for two weeks on vacation.Sitting in the lobby to get email was a bit troublesome. The rooms seem to have wired Ethernet jacks, but no service yet.",October 2013,Villa del Palmar Beach Resort & Spa at The Islands of Loreto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150772-d1987334-Reviews-Villa_del_Palmar_Beach_Resort_Spa_at_The_Islands_of_Loreto-Loreto_Baja_California.html,"Loreto, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
