See this,"It doesn't take long to see the remains of the Temple of Zeus, but it is well worth the visit. The remaining columns and the one that has fallen over are massive.

New Acropolis museum,"The construction of the museum reveals under glass layers of Athens they found as they excavated. The top floor of the new building is canted compared to the other floors to display the top remains of the Pantheon in the same exact size and compass orientation as it is on the Acropolis outside. From the ground floor you view remnants found at lower levels, and then the top level shows what had been at the top of the building.

"If breakfast was improved slightly, it would be perfect here!","The front desk was great. Business center computers worked. Room was very clean and comfortable. Manager's reception had tasty snacks including potato salad, which was a first. Cocktails were mixed fine, but server didn't realize when I asked for whiskey on the rocks, that whiskey is a particular liquor. She thought Tequila was whiskey. She probably thought I meant liquor, when I said whiskey. It was funny once we figured out how that happened.

"large $8 margarita's & fabulous food, but liked the old location better","We visited on a very busy night. The place was packed by the time we finished. From the dining area you can see the cooks making the food. Although our food sat on the counter waiting for the last plate to be prepared before it was all served to us, it was still surprisingly served hot. The manager told us he'd remake it or drop it from our bill, but there was no need. The food was terrific. The margaritas were good too! Water-glass sized margaritas were just $8. The beef steak Churrasco was perfectly cooked and tender. It had delicious chimichurri on it. The Parrallida Mixta was excellent with beef, chicken, pork, and lots of chimichurri. My daughter said she would have liked the Shrimp Moqueca (curry) to have been spicy, but she didn't ask for it that way.
We couldn't get espresso after dinner because a live band made the espresso machine inaccessible to the staff. Note: the old location was larger.
The background music (even before the band arrived) was too loud. My son-in-law asked them to turn it down, and they did, but then they almost immediately turned it up loud again.",December 2016,Azuca Nuevo Latino Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60956-d437262-Reviews-Azuca_Nuevo_Latino_Restaurant-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.0

They are bringing in vendors who have paletas, pizza and others. They also have a park activity director who has great activities. One night he had a downtown scavenger hunt for the kids.

For the AlamoBowl one of the elevator operators only allowed 5 people on at a time. The line was ridiculous to get onto the elevator. The steps are very difficult for some people, and if you think you'll just give it a try to get to a higher level, be prepared. There are probably 40-50 steps between floors.

"Yikes $16 margarita, but very friendly staff","We went for a bowl game. The sound system was not very good. We could not understand the referee or the announcer for penalties.
The bartender selling $16 well drinks and margaritas was very friendly. All of the staff getting us into the arena was very efficient and friendly. The only time we had a problem was when we left the Club level to visit friends elsewhere, and the staff would NOT give us a stamp on our hand so we could return. We had Club level tickets, and were told we had to have the stamp, but we couldn't find the person with the stamp.
On the main level, a vendor was giving out samples of the prime rib (for sandwiches) and it was as good as any I have ever tasted!
It's a nice stadium. The seats in Club level are very comfortable. They are padded and wider than in some of the other sections.

Call ahead seating was helpful on New Years Eve,"My sister called to make a reservation days in advance. They had explained to her that gets you to the front of the list, but they don't hold a table for you. We arrived and the place was packed with many people waiting for tables. After getting in the wrong line, then waiting in the correct line for about 15 minutes to tell them we were there, we were seated upstairs about 10 minutes later.
I ordered the shrimp pasta which was tasty, but uninspired. They were able to leave out an ingredient in a dish ordered by my sister. The New England Clam Chowder had more clams in it than any I had ever previously encountered in chowder. I loved all the whole clams in it! The bread served in a basket looked like it was leftover biscuits from the previous weeks Sunday brunch. Our food came out quickly, which was appreciated.
It is a very old building where the staff has to bring the food up the stairs from the kitchen on the same stairs used by customers. They evidently know what they are doing, but it is awkward.
The price is fair for what you get. Maybe because it was New Years Eve, there were only 3 desserts available, none of which sounded interesting.",December 2016,O.C.

"tasty food, slow service","I ate the stuffed crab and it was tasty. I also ordered the clam chowder. While it tasted fine, it lacked enough clams. The Brunswick Stew was delicious and very meaty.

There are several things to see at the Crab Shack, such as the dozens of alligators, the poor caged birds (they were very bored, in small cages), and the gift shop.

"chartered trolley for a day, rode standard tour next day","Our group chartered 3 trolleys for all day the week before Christmas. We did the historic tour, which was excellent. They also took us to the Tybee Island Lighthouse and the Crab Shack, which was nice. Radar, our driver/tour guide, was excellent. In the afternoon, we were each given Christmas sheet music and the Christmas lights inside the trolley were turned on. We drove through the most heavily populated streets of Savannah singing Christmas carols to the music blaring on our bus speakers. People on the streets and sidewalks were smiling and waving to us. We had a jolly good time!
We also took the standard full length tour the next day, and this other driver said different (sometimes conflicting) things about the same site we had heard about the previous day. That was amusing. The drivers told us a lot about the Savannah College of Art and Design which has many buildings in the city. That was very interesting, too.
Both tour drivers were very knowledgeable, or were great storytellers. Either way, we enjoyed the trolley tour very much. I'm sure we saw way more in a shorter time period than anyone who didn't use the trolley.",December 2016,Old Town Trolley Tours of Savannah,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60814-d556094-Reviews-Old_Town_Trolley_Tours_of_Savannah-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",attractions,5.0,4.5

You can drive through the cemetery and stop wherever you want. It is fascinating to read the headstone dates, and to see the ornateness of many of the family areas.

We were allowed to check out 8 hours late the last day, and they only charges us $45. While we were gone to another part of Nepal for a couple of days, they stored our luggage for us for free. Service here is superb.
The first floor restaurant is very good. We ate most dinners there. The included breakfast can get a bit monotonous after a week even though they have cooked-to-order eggs every day.

typical Sonic food minus the fresh fruit slushes,"I ate a 50 cent corn dog with mustard and a slush. They are excellent corn-dogs. From what I understand they don't have the lemon and strawberry slush anymore, which is what I bought for many years. They now have frozen lemonade. I miss the fresh fruit slushes.

"Brilliant concept, seats not quite right","The price of a matinee on the weekends is reasonable at about $7.75. I believe matinee times go through 4 pm. The bottomless bowl of popcorn with clarified butter was delicious. I think the popcorn was $6.75. But, here, you don't have to get up to go get a refill, as there is service at your seat. I'd definitely return.
The seats were a little uncomfortable, as the part you sit on seems to slant down at the front, rather than being level. Even though we had assigned seats, we shifted down a couple of seats and it was better.
Service was great.",October 2016,Alamo Drafthouse Stone Oak,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60956-d4473397-Reviews-Alamo_Drafthouse_Stone_Oak-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",attractions,4.0,4.0
I love their coleslaw,"I love their creamy coleslaw. It is always cold and of a consistent texture. I don't eat chicken, so this is all I get there.

love the salsa bar and the beef tacos,"Food was excellent. We had beef steak tacos and brisket tacos, along with rice and baracho beans. Both tacos were excellent, but I preferred the steak tacos. I like that I can select exactly the toppings I want on my taco, with several choices of salsa and pico de gallo. I'd eat here again. We went late one evening, and every table in the back room needed to be cleared from previous patrons. Other than that, it was a great visit.",October 2016,Taco Cabana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60956-d4178966-Reviews-Taco_Cabana-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Delicious 2-course lunch special is a great deal!,"The advertising board outside the entrance says a 2 course lunch is $15. I've been there twice, and both times, it was excellent. I loved the vodka penne and the crisp calamari. And, tiramisu with coffee is just $5. The tiramisu is delicious, too. $15 for lunch in New York City is a great deal. Service was excellent.

"Wanted a snack, but they were out of most everything","Although they had a nice display case with enticing desserts, the display items were not for sale. The only sale items were kept in a plastic Tupperware-like container behind the counter. I just wanted a cookie or cake item. They had exactly 1 cookie to be sold. Why do they have lemon pound cake, pumpkin bread, chocolate chunk cookies, etc on display, but don't have them for sale?
On the other hand, the barista behind the counter was very nice.",September 2016,Starbucks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d4114248-Reviews-Starbucks-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Large pizza with tasty toppings,"We ordered a whole 18 inch Margareta pizza. The herbs on the pizza were outstanding. The outside crust of the pizza was excellent. I would have liked the center part of the crust to be more cooked. The crust was a little thicker than I wanted, and definitely soggier. The toppings, however, made the pizza! I wouldn't recommend their pizza to friends.",September 2016,Patzeria Perfect Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d778986-Reviews-Patzeria_Perfect_Pizza-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.5

"Great value, decent burger and fries","This is an amazing place hidden just steps from the front-desk of the hotel. There is no sign, just a line of people waiting to get inside. The entire place, including the kitchen is about 25 feet by 25 feet. They can seat about 60 people in this small space. The place is always packed, which is a clue.
Two burgers, fries, and 2 bottles of water here are less than $30. That is a huge deal in NY city. The burgers are a bit small, but tasty. The fries are McDonald's style. I'm not a big burger fan, but I enjoyed their burgers twice in 4 days.
I highly recommend this place for it's value.",September 2016,burger joint,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d638999-Reviews-Burger_joint-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Looked like a new plane,"Plane on flight from JFK to San Antonio was very new looking. Still my tray table had sticky pink drink left on it from someone prior to my getting on the plane. So did my husband's tray table.
The overhead compartments may be a little deeper than others, because they easily held the roll-on bags people put there.
Flight attendants were nice. Though the flight was only about 4 hours long, and it was not quite sold out, the planes bathroom was out of tissues, and nearly out of toilet paper.
I like the cheese and fruit snack that is available for purchase on the plane. It is $8.50.
Wifi wasn't working during our flight.
I am handicapped and the gate attendant called me and my husband over to allow us to get boarded early. That was very much appreciated!",September 2016,Delta Air Lines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729060-Reviews-Delta-Air-Lines,World,flights,3.0,4.0
"Fabulous view, amazing sunset","The tallest building in the Western Hemisphere provides an incredible view of New York and New Jersey. On a clear day, they said you can see Pennsylvania and Connecticut. We set our tickets for 5 pm entry. This allowed us time to get to the top well before the sun set. The sunset was amazing. A person who works there said the terrific sunset usually lasts about 10 minutes. This evening it lasted for an hour.
There are 2 areas where someone provides a talk about a variety of topics dealing with the World Trade Center, or food in New York, or what to see and do in NY. It is well worth listening to the talks to learn more.
If you can't stand for long, bring a wheelchair, as there is very little seating available.
There are special Ipads available for $15 which show you what is located outside the tower. They aren't calibrated very well, and not nearly enough sites are labeled as to what they are. I paid $15, but I felt it wasn't worth it.
Loved the experience, and would definitely do it again. No doubt, the view changes every day.",September 2016,One World Observatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d8072300-Reviews-One_World_Observatory-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.5

Incredible - Last showing of Les Miserables,"I was fortunate to see the very last showing of Les Miserables at the Imperial. This wasn't my first time to see Les Miserables.

Climb into the crown!,"If you order tickets 4-6 months in advance, you can climb up to the crown of the Statue of Liberty. This was a bucket list item of mine. Even though I had had Achilles tendon surgery just 3 months prior to my visit, I was able to climb the 357 steps from the pedestal up to the crown. I don't know how many steps there are from the ground to the pedestal. Since you can go at your leisure, it was no problem. Coming down the stairs, I faced the steps as if I was going down a ladder. To me, it made it much easier. There are landings every 20 or so steps, making it easy to rest if you need to do so.",September 2016,Statue of Liberty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d103887-Reviews-Statue_of_Liberty-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.5

"I'd eat there again, but there were problems","We went for Restaurant Week dinner. We both ordered the lamb. A different waitress brought us our entree - which wasn't what we had ordered. This wrong item looked and smelled amazing, but it wasn't what we had ordered. She immediately apologized and took that away and asked what we had ordered. Within just a few minutes the lamb arrived. It definitely looked and tasted reheated. And, the lamb was not medallions as advertised. It was cut with the grain, rather than against the grain. It was tasty, but the sides were not totally hot. We were disappointed by the lamb and sides. The grilled vegetable side was fried brussel sprouts. They were tasty, but probably fried, not grilled. The double chocolate espresso bundt cake dessert was extremely dry. Even with a sauce, it was tough to get down without drinking something. MoH was fair and took 25% off our bill without us asking.
The next day, we went back for Restaurant Week lunch and ordered the same dish they had accidentally served to us the night prior. The entree was delicious - pappardelle pasta with mussels, olives, and zinfandel butter sauce. At lunch, the strawberry shortcake was very good.
The service was very good both days, except for getting the wrong entree to our table.
