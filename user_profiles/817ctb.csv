A 70s time capsule (in a bad way),"One of the worst hotel rooms I have stayed in for quite a while. I will give the reasonably comfortable beds credit - they were fine. Beyond that, the carpet was in the “I definitely don’t want to walk around without socks on” category. Ugly, dated and worn.

The bathroom was right out of 1972. Heavy tiled floor, tub enclosure looks like the kind of thing my dad would install in a rental home back in the 70s. Furnishings are uniformly dated (1970s style heavy oak). I literally didn’t want to touch the draperies, for fear of dislodging a torrent of dust from the Carter administration.",October 2020,Best Western Plus GranTree Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45095-d76438-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_GranTree_Inn-Bozeman_Montana.html,"Bozeman, Montana",hotels,2.0,4.0
Our one “big” dinner,"I was in town with a group of guys on an annual ski trip. Each year we go to a different ski resort area. Over the course of a week, we usually eat two nice meals out and cook in the rest of the time. So, in this case, our two meals out were the Pioneer and the Ketchum Grill.

We were pretty tired from our day skiing, so didn’t want to be out too late. We had a reservation, but showed up about 45 minutes early to see if they could accommodate us. They were pretty busy, but fit in our group of five.

Everyone enjoyed their dinner. I had the lemon pasta and it was very good. Not that guys on a ski trip are too quick to share their food, but it was good enough that I wanted to offer my friends a small taste. I ordered extra bread more than once because I wanted to soak up the lovely sauce (I like anything that tastes lemony).

I had an appetizer too, but don’t remember what it was. We were getting tired and didn’t stay for dessert.

All in all, I think our group was “wowed,” which is kinda hard with a group of guys on a ski trip.",March 2020,Ketchum Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35500-d401595-Reviews-Ketchum_Grill-Ketchum_Idaho.html,"Ketchum, Idaho",restaurants,4.0,4.5
We were on a guys ski trip...,"We were on a guys ski trip and took one day off to recharge. We decided to go bowling at the Sun Valley lodge and after two games, asked the attendant for her favorite pizza place in town. This is where she recommended so this is where we went.

I’m a big New York style pizza fan, so this was in line with my pizza preferences. Our group of 5 split two of the largest size pizzas and that was enough for the group.

The decor is somewhere between not much and nonexistent. We were the only folks in there that afternoon, except for one local sitting a the bar talking to the guy on duty.

The seating was cramped and uncomfortable.

However, I really liked the pizza.

Please note that my 3 star review is not meant as criticism. I am a pretty tough grader, so I marked it down for the really uncomfortable seating and minimal decor, but that is not a knock on the pizza at all.",March 2020,Wiseguy Pizza Pie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35471-d5058897-Reviews-Wiseguy_Pizza_Pie-Hailey_Idaho.html,"Hailey, Idaho",restaurants,3.0,4.0
As good as I remember it!,"We arrived in Sun Valley on February 28th (my birthday) for a guy’s ski week. There were five guys total and we hadn’t even dropped off our gear at the condo yet, but we all agreed to have dinner at the Pio on the way into town from the airport. As usual, the waiting area was pretty crowded, but we were told the wait was 20-30 minutes. Pretty good for a Friday evening. We all got drinks ordered at the bar, but shortly after being served, our table was ready (the wait had been closer to 15 minutes).

The last time I had eaten here was almost 25 years ago. I was eager to check if it was as good as I remembered.

Service was excellent.

Food was excellent. I had the prime rib and. It was certainly the best I’ve had in a dozen or more years. I remember back in the day, prime rib was a real popular cut of meat. I seldom order it these days, because even if it looks cooked to order (the rare side of medium rare is my preference), it is often bland and either mushy or chewy. Again, this was an epic prime rib dinner. Of the three portion sizes, I ordered the middle one, and took about 1/3 of it home, which made a couple great sandwiches after skiing later in the week.

I ate my salad and potato and each were very good, but the meat is what I was after and I’m happy I got it.

My friends made a big deal about it being my birthday, so we got comped a piece of (I think it was) mud pie, which we all shared.",March 2020,Pioneer Saloon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35500-d401601-Reviews-Pioneer_Saloon-Ketchum_Idaho.html,"Ketchum, Idaho",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Cramped room,"Just checked out today after three nights in town for a soccer tournament. We booked a one bedroom so I got the large bed and my son got the pull out sofa.

I’ve stayed at a lot of Embassy Suites (ES) over the years and this was one of the smaller rooms I’ve had. More importantly, it was crammed with so many pieces of furniture that it was very hard to use the space. The maids would leave the pull out soft “out” each day after sprucing up the room. Between that and about double the correct amount of furniture, there was barely anywhere to stand. Yes, we could have put the sofa back together ourselves, but I’ve never needed to do that at any other ES.

Beyond that, a very clean, relatively new hotel. The lobby was light and bright. The breakfast was very adequate.

I just think that the hotel got sold about 2X the furniture each room needed.",January 2020,"Embassy Suites by Hilton Portland Hillsboro, Oregon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g51907-d6729106-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_by_Hilton_Portland_Hillsboro_Oregon-Hillsboro_Oregon.html,"Hillsboro, Oregon",hotels,3.0,4.5
Our particular room had serious problems,"We booked our stay here almost 10 months in advance for 10 nights over Christmas vacation. The group consisted of my wife and I and our three teenage boys.

The room we booked was a oceanfront room and the average cost was about $850 per night before taxes. We consider this to be more on the moderate end of the spectrum, given the holiday period.

We read a number of online reviews which almost made us cancel our reservation. After talking to the hotel, we ended up continuing our planned visit. Ultimately, we decided that this was a “bang for the buck“ room and weren’t expecting the finishes to be luxurious.

The room that we received on arrival was on the second floor with a northerly view. We do not know how often this room gets rented out, but the condition was by our standards pretty poor.

The decor was probably at least 30 years out of date. By this I refer to the very faded carpeting, which you could tell changed about 10 shades due to some pretty obvious places where the furniture has been moved around. The cabinets in the kitchen and bathroom and almost all of the doors were very banged up. I could imagine 10 or 20 nicks in a single bathroom drawer, where the paint was missing. The truth of the matter is, none of these aesthetic issues really bothered us, as they were pretty much what we expected.

The problems that we had were more about the functionality of the unit. Each of the two toilets barely flushed, and you need it to hold down the handle and flush it four or five times to make it work. Yes, we asked for this to be looked at, and the maintenance technician came up, but they didn’t improve anything.

Every single faucet was unable to be 100% shut off, so there was always water dripping from the kitchen faucet or the bathroom faucets. The handles themselves were loose and felt like they were going to come off in your hand. Because of this, for example, it was very hard to set the temperature properly in the shower.

The dishwasher barely worked and we probably ran each load of dishes three or four times to get them clean. Yes, we always pre-rinse our dishes, so trust me when I say that this thing simply didn’t work. It also smelled awful when we first arrived.

The stove top worked OK, but the oven barely worked at all. My wife tried to toast a tray of bagels one morning toward the end of our trip. It took about an hour to get them barely toasted at all. If this had happened earlier in our stay, we would have complained. As it was this was the second to last day, so we just dealt with it.

One of the most annoying things, was that all of the sliding glass doors out to the deck were in very bad shape. I actually strained my back because in order to open the doors you had to use both hands and “really put your back into it“ to get them to open or shut. This was even true of the screen doors. As a property manager myself, I know what it takes to fix these, you take the doors off the tracks and replace the little wheels that they ride on. Forget about the idea of walking out onto the deck with a drink in your hand or carrying a plate of food. It literally couldn’t be done unless you used both hands and strained yourself.

For a pretty high-end unit, it had very out of date and small TV sets.

Most of the closet doors continually came off the track and were very difficult to close. There were bifold doors where are the end that moves never stayed in the track. And just like the sliders out to the deck, the closets with sliding doors were very difficult to open and close also.

We know that this is a condominium and that the units are individually owned and further that upgrades to the furnishings and amenities are the individual owners responsibility. I can only assume, that this facility never inspects the units or enforces any standards whatsoever.

We tried the so-called “beach club“ restaurant, and had a fairly negative experience. Feel free to read my separate review of that.

There are some things on the property that are just plain stupid. One of the things we enjoy doing when in Maui is to barbecue our dinner. Unfortunately, the barbecues are about as far away from the hotel rooms as they could possibly be, actually up by the road past the tennis courts. That’s a pretty damn far distance to travel carrying all your barbecue food and equipment. We’ve stayed at many condominiums in Maui where the barbecues are near the water, so you can have a pleasant view and socialize while you are cooking. Definitely not the case here.

Overall, we would consider our experience here to have been substandard. The public areas are very tired and dated, the staff goes through the motions of being hospitable, but clearly don’t care very much.

Since this was an oceanfront room, the view was nice. Unfortunately, it was difficult to impossible to use the deck in the evening as there are no lights out there at all. This one is on whoever designed the hotel.",January 2020,Aston Kaanapali Shores,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60634-d87290-Reviews-Aston_Kaanapali_Shores-Lahaina_Maui_Hawaii.html,"Maui, Hawaii",hotels,2.0,4.0
"Near the beach, but nothing “clubby” about it.","If you use the word “club” in the name of your restaurant, I recommend you then try to make the patrons feel welcome. Sadly, not the case here.

After a few nights at the surrounding Aston Hotel, my kids begged us to take them to “happy hour” at the Beach Club. My kids are teenagers and didn’t expect alcohol. However, they do know what a happy hour is and expected one.

When we arrived in the mid afternoon, around 2, only one other table was occupied in the restaurant section. The bar area was crowded and there was a long line for the walk up bar serving the pool area.

The waiter seemed truly annoyed that he had to take care of us. It took about 15 minutes just to get in a drink order and probably another 15 to order lunch. FWIW, the waiter at Bubba Gump was 500X more personable.

The food was passable, and candidly, we didn’t expect much.

It’s just the vibe was so off. This could be Gilligan’s Island, but instead a truly awful and worthless poolside bar. If you are sitting in a lounge chair poolside, you are probably happy this place exists to serve your snacking and beverage needs.

We never returned after our first visit - too bad, because had it been an enjoyable time, we might have visited everyday of our 11 day stay at the hotel.

Long time customer - first time disappointed.,"We’ve visited here at least once each trip to Maui over the last 15 years. This was our first visit since the remodel a couple years ago. They did improve the “structure” and amenities. We were all disappointed in some way with our food.

My youngest son (a huge burger fan) had been begging us to bring him throughout our 11 day Xmas vacation visit. Today is our last full day and we finally squeezed in a visit. He pronounced the hamburger the worst he’s ever had in his life. Not wanting to eat it all, he shared it with his two older brothers. Everyone pronounced it awful. The “beef” was some sort of meatloaf they make with panko breading and some other stuff (honestly can’t remember). All agreed that the only identifiable flavors were the tomato (cut about as thick as the meat patty) and mayonnaise. In fact, the kids were all wondering whether they had slipped in some sort of meatless burger patty by mistake. With three teenage boys (16, 17 and 18 years old), I can tell you that this was the only burger I can ever remember not being completely eaten by someone!

Everyone also agreed that the taro chips were beyond flavorless. Both my youngest and my wife had dishes that came with the taro chips and all but a couple were still on the plates when they were cleared away.

We has a spam masubi starter (weird - because you had to assemble it yourself - but OK). They didn’t give you enough rice to put them together. We also had the wings which were the tastiest thing we ordered, but I think there were only five on the plate, so everyone got just one - pretty lame.

Two boys had the Aloha Mixed Plate, both of which were fine. However, the kids were still hungry at the end of dinner (the mostly uneaten burger notwithstanding) so we ordered a side of fries. Pretty bland and tasteless, and not even a decent portion.

We love the location and vibe - but don’t know if we will be back.",January 2020,Aloha Mixed Plate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29220-d467379-Reviews-Aloha_Mixed_Plate-Maui_Hawaii.html,"Maui, Hawaii",restaurants,2.0,4.0

There is no way I would wait for a table here, but it was pretty empty and we got a good Oceanside table. Waiter was very funny and entertaining. Kids loved him. We could tell he did the same “schtick” for every group, but we was a great guy.

I don’t understand what folks see in this place,"As a supposedly self-proclaimed seafood restaurant, this is not the place to dine on fresh fish simply prepared. Perhaps I missed an item or two on the menu, but most dishes are heavily sauced and the exact opposite of northwest style seafood.

My son and I both enjoyed our crab stuffed halibut, but it was only ordered as the seemingly safest choice. My mother’s crab stuffed prawns were drowning in butter at the bottom of the plate. My wife’s stuffed salmon (you getting the trend here) was simply awful (cold and should never have been served) and was sent back.

The waiter meant well, but clearly doesn’t understand table service. For example, he did his “how is the food” visit before anyone had taken a bite, yet was nowhere to be found once we had and my wife’s food was unacceptable. We ordered a wine by sparkman, which he kept calling “sparkling wine” (clearly he didn’t understand the wine list).

My two boys had a cup of chowder, but pronounced it “good, but not as good as Ivars.”

Nothing was terrible (with the exception of my wife’s salmon), but given the relatively steep prices, we won’t be back.

I don’t understand what the deal is.,"I’ve now been to the habit three times, with my wife and kids. I do not understand what the attraction of this place is at all.

For fast food, the wait for the food is unbelievably long. I don’t believe I’ve ever waited as long to get an order served as I have at this establishment.

Cool vibe,"My wife and I headed down to Venice Beach to kill some time by ourselves, i.e. while her kids were doing something else. We were hungry and decided to give this place a try.

Fun for a group,"We were in Marina Del Ray to get our son set up to start school at LMU. Ourselves and two other families decided to have a group dinner to kick off the festivities.

We were able to make a reservation for 13 persons. They are very picky that the entire party be present before they are seated, and that everyone be there on time. We made sure we were compliant with this requirement, but don’t know what we would have done if someone had been five minutes late because they were circling looking for parking.

This was our first visit, and we really didn’t understand the menu. The person who had recommended that we visit here had said it was kind of family style Italian. That really didn’t seem to be the case, and everybody ordered their own entrée. We did start with several platters of calamari, however.

There were only three of us who drink alcohol that were of age, and we polished off (most of) a pretty big jug of Chianti. It was decent jug wine and added to the festive nature of the evening.

We were told that the waiters periodically saying, but we didn’t see this occurred during our lengthy dinner. It seemed that they did try to get the crowd to sing along with a recording.

I think it’s worthy of noting that the bathrooms are pretty filthy and there is only one for each gender. At one point there were about 10 people in the bathroom line and it was pretty annoying. Fortunately this was at the end of our evening. If it had been during the middle of the meal, somebody could’ve easily been stuck in the bathroom line for 15 or 20 minutes.

In summary, it was a fun evening.

"Pricey, but we enjoyed it.","Since we are getting towards the last week of summer, my wife and I decided to bring our three teenage boys to downtown Seattle to walk around and do the typical touristy things. We walked along the waterfront, went through the pike place market, etc.

We didn’t really plan to do anything that cost money, but when we got down by the big wheel, we thought about whether to do that or wings over Washington. Since we really enjoy Disney’s soaring over California, that made our decision easy.

We thought the ride was pretty expensive, but figured, since we were just locals staying in town who never do anything that cost money, what the heck? There was essentially no line outside, although there was a line in the staging area inside the front door. There was just one group and we went to the preshow sitting on some benches and watching a reasonably funny video

We weren’t sure if it was going to be as good as soaring over California, but were basically pretty pleased. It was a lot of fun and definitely something to do.

Staycation,"Since it is summer vacation from school, my wife and I decided to have a “tourist“ day in Seattle. We live in Bellevue, and rarely come downtown other than for sporting events.

After walking in Seattle waterfront and going through the market, my teenage boys were getting hungry. I thought it would be worthwhile to eat at the Athenian. I didn’t expect anything special from the kitchen, but I did expect tourist level pricing.

The simple fact is we had a grand time, sitting upstairs with a large table by the window. Two of my boys had hamburgers, which they thought were very good. My oldest son, who is 18, had a bowl of mussels. Candidly, I can’t remember what my wife ate. I actually didn’t eat here at all, because I had him business dinner right afterwards, but I would have if my schedule permitted.

I just don’t get it...,"My office is now in the lower Queenanne area of Seattle and this pizza place is within walking distance. I was looking forward to being able to go over for a couple slices once or twice a week. I’ve been there four times so far in the last few weeks and two of those times I ended up walking out.

The reason is simple. They don’t have any slices for sale. I’d assume that they are familiar with the concept of people eating lunch sometime starting around noon. But when I walk in there might be one single slice sitting out, usually something weird with spinach on it. All I want is a couple cheese slices and I am good to go. So why don’t they have any premade and ready to go? The last time I went there they said it would be a 12 minute wait for a cheese slice. Sorry, but that’s not how a pizza by the slice is supposed to work.

I will still keep trying to go there, but I can’t believe that it is so hard to have slices available for a walk up customers so why don’t they have any premade and ready to go?

At that time of day, it was relatively empty, we were served right away and the service was attentive. The menu is pretty short, with some fairly basic items.

My son had a burger and fries and I had the pastrami Reuben. First, the fries were excellent, very crispy. I don’t know what oil they use for frying, but it seems something different. The fry sauce was very good as well.

I really liked my Reuben. It was grilled perfectly. Properly heated (I’ve had reubens on occasion that weren’t heated all the way through). Very tangy flavor. I tasted my son’s burger and it was good too, but I don’t recall any unusual flavor profile.

Seems to be slipping,"Going to big Bubba’s burgers is a special treat for our kids when we are driving to our beach place on Hartstein Island. We don’t stop here all the time because of the cost, but when we do make the decision to spend the money, we are normally happy we went.

For example, myself my 14-year-old son and a friend of his stopped in for dinner on the drive down Friday evening. The kids each had a burger and either fries or onion rings and a shake. I had a double burger and a shake. They give you tons of fries, so there were more than enough for the three of us to share.

The cost including tax was around $43. Which for me is a lot of money to spend on what is fast food. But then again, there’s nothing like it around, and I know they’ve got to make their money on the few days when the weather is great and there’s a lot of people passing through. So I don’t blame the owners on the cost, I just want everyone to know that it is a lot more expensive then you might expect it to be.

I do really like the shakes, and it is actually the only place I ever order a shake. My personal preference is either the Cherry or the raspberry.

I think the onion rings are excellent and worth the stop all by themselves. If you’re wondering what the burgers are like, they are fairly analogous to those at Kidd Valley, if you are familiar with the flavor profile there.

This all being said, the last few times I have been there, I have been a little disappointed. I don’t know if it’s me, but the burgers don’t seem quite as big as I remember them. And the flavor seems a little off. For example, their burgers have the special sauce that tastes a little like thousand Island dressing. But it seems to have more of a mayonnaise flavor now.., in other words, less flavor.

Guys ski trip dinner,"We ate here with a group of 8 guys during a week-long guy’s ski trip. We usually have several dinners out, and thought this would be nice. It is a beautiful setting and we got a nice large table right by the window. FYI, we brought in about 10 bottles of our own wine and ordered another two when we ran short - it was that kind of an evening.

We shared a variety of appetizers, including fried oysters and two others (sorry, I’ve now forgotten what they were). All were very good, but we’re relatively small portions.

Just about everyone had a salad, which I thought were all underwhelming. Small and nothing very special.

The good news was that everyone thoroughly enjoyed their entree. Most ordered a steak or prime rib. All were well cooked and sizable. I wasn’t very hungry and opted for the scallops on risotto. I thoroughly enjoyed my dish, including the broccoli on the side.

Most had dessert and/or coffee. Again, very good desserts.

Overall, a very enjoyable evening, happy we came, and a beautiful setting,

I would say the service was on the weak side, although I’m sure a group like ours is hard to care for. I am quite strict about proper table service at a full-service restaurant, and the things like refilling wine and water glasses, replenishing bread, etc.... are important details. There is room for improvement there.

Still, we left happy and I would not hesitate to return.",April 2019,Broken Top Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51766-d3809686-Reviews-Broken_Top_Club-Bend_Central_Oregon_Oregon.html,"Bend, Oregon",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good burgers,"Visited last night with my wife and teenage son. We all had burgers and shared some garlic fries. Burgers were excellent but extremely greasy. Now, I say this in a good way, in other words dripping with juices from the meat, but let’s be honest, those “juices” aren’t water. The fries were also good, but not very many for $8.50.

Service was excellent and fast when taking our order and serving us, but they then got busy and it took forever to get our bill and pay.",April 2019,Simmzy's Venice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32655-d8626150-Reviews-Simmzy_s_Venice-Los_Angeles_California.html,"Los Angeles, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good lunch spot,"We were in Park City on a guys ski week. Our first day after arriving, the weather wasn’t too nice for skiing so we decided to explore “downtown” Park City (we were staying at a condo in the Canyons). I believe all six members of our group had a great time, good service, food ambience, friendly service.

I had the blue cheese burger, which I thought was excellent. The beers were good also.

Now, I just gave a far nicer restaurant a three star rating, so please understand, I am reviewing this place as a ski town tavern, not a fine dining establishment.

My understanding is that the place gets pretty crazy later in the day, but I would say it was about 1/3 full during our visit.

I would definitely visit here again.",March 2019,No Name Saloon & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57097-d1013646-Reviews-No_Name_Saloon_Grill-Park_City_Utah.html,"Park City, Utah",restaurants,4.0,4.5
The little things matter,"Ate here during a “guys” ski week. Food was great. I had the lamb shank, which was very good.

The server was attentive, but he had too many tables to cover. The martini glass from my before dinner drink - still on the table while we ate desert.

Water glass - usually empty.

Dangerous health pracrices,"Just ate there an hour ago, waiting for a flight at the airport. We were seated at the table closest to the kitchen. There are no doors, so we could see everything going on. We were told 2X that the calamari we ordered was being recooked (not a new one mind you, but just put back in the deep fryer as it was underdone). Clearly, whoever is cooking has no idea what they are doing.

We overheard the guy who was expediting at least five times send food (other than ours) that was undercooked back for more cooking time. There seemed to be great chaos in the kitchen, although we did enjoy watching the waitresses do a little group dance while they were waiting for food to come up.

In theory, the expo guy was cleaning up the mess left by the incompetent cooks. The problem is how he was coming to his conclusions. I saw numerous times in a row, he would take the top bun off a burger, feel the temperature with his UNGLOVED hand and then pronounce whether it was cooked enough or not. Not an isolated instance - clearly this is just how he does his job.

I looked around for a manager to inform, but my best guess is that he was the highest ranking staffer there, so I didn’t say anything.

My advice to you if you go here - sit next to the kitchen so you can watch what they do with your food!",March 2019,Gordon Biersch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60922-d3836561-Reviews-Gordon_Biersch-Salt_Lake_City_Utah.html,"Salt Lake City, Utah",restaurants,1.0,3.5
Best steakhouse in Utah?,"Just dined there with a group of 6 guys on a ski week to Park City. I was entirely unimpressed. I have no idea how this could be the “best steakhouse in Utah.”

Most diners seem to opt for the salad bar, an institution that I thought had disappeared in the 1980s. I took a quick look, but was uninterested. I opted for what was probably the most tasteless “Caesar” salad I have ever had. If a steakhouse hasn’t mastered that dish, what else can’t they do?

I ordered the Kansas City steak, between rare and medium rare. It was properly cooked to order, but was again somewhat tough and flavorless. I don’t care if they say they age their beef for 30 days or whatever. Candidly, it was about equivalent (notwithstanding being properly cooked) that what you might get at a typical diner when you order the steak and eggs for breakfast.

I asked for a baked potato for my side dish, with none of the typical butter or sour cream, and instead asked for a cup of au jus. First, it didn’t arrive with my dish, so I had to ask them to bring it when they checked on our meal. Second, it was in a boiling hot small cup, rather than a small cup that could be poured. I needed to wait a while for the cup to cool down before I could pour it into my potato, to avoid burning my hand. What I got was (again) the most flavorless au jus that I have ever had, frankly far worse than I make at home out of a KNORR packet.

The foregoing all being said, my companions seemed to have enjoyed their meals.

I ordered the fresh berries for a dessert, which was a small cup with 90% blueberries, 10% sliced strawberries with a decent whipped cream topping. It was what I ordered, so I won’t complain, but candidly nothing special.

Lastly, about the service.... the dining room is packed full of staff. There was no shortage of folks wandering around, bumping into each other. But they were never available when you wanted something. We refilled our own wine glasses all evening, refilled our water glasses from the pitcher left on the table, etc.... In short, not “fine dining” table service. In my opinion, this is a typical ski area steak house that acts like it is better than it is.",March 2019,Grub Steak Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57097-d396389-Reviews-Grub_Steak_Restaurant-Park_City_Utah.html,"Park City, Utah",restaurants,3.0,4.5

Frankly, we’ve had much better teriyaki type beef anywhere (any random place in a strip mall).

Went with my wife and I and three teenage boys, all looking for something different than the fish tacos and Korean ribs we’ve been eating s lot of all week.

The burger fix was a failure. When teenage boys call the food greasy and unhealthy, you know you have a problem.

The place was 2/3 empty but service was extremely slow.

The onion rings and fries tasted like they were using year old fry grease. The funny thing is, I love “good” grease, but this was bad grease.

My son’s introduction to Nashville,"I am in town with my 17-year-old son doing some college visits. He’s never been to Nashville before, so after arriving at a hotel, we asked our hotel shuttle driver where we should go first and he recommended we stop by here.

I don’t really like the ordering system or having to fight for a table, but we were able to get one just fine. It’s a little bit weird having to order your food from a line, but then have a separate wait or come by for your drink order.

That being said, the food king quickly and we thought the waiters did a good job of keeping everything moving. We really wanted to come see some music and be in a place where you didn’t have to be over 21. My son likes his hamburger, and I especially liked the hot chicken sandwich. It was a great introduction to Nashville. We looked around the other levels of the restaurant, but didn’t see anything better than staying on the ground floor.",November 2018,Acme Feed & Seed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55229-d6600113-Reviews-Acme_Feed_Seed-Nashville_Davidson_County_Tennessee.html,"Nashville, Tennessee",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Please understand that doesn’t mean it tasted bad, only that there was no smoke flavor, Smoke ring, or any indication that this was a true barbecued item. It was a lot more like sliced flank steak. The ribs were pretty good, and I did like the Carolina sauce. The side dishes were generally cold and bland and and uninteresting.

Thoroughly disappointing,"First let me say that the hotel did advertise that it was undergoing renovations. I guess they are thinking that if they tell you when advance that in anything no matter how bad does from then on.

At check in, they take pains to tell you how great everything is going to be in a few weeks when it’s done. I have no idea what good that will do me, since I will probably never be back to this hotel.

3/4 of the lobby is blocked off, which limits your ability to relax on the premises.

They say they’ve completed redoing the guestrooms, but they are nothing special whatsoever. If this is an upgraded room, this brand is fading fast. There’s a lot of small things wrong with our room, such as that there seems to be only one TV remote for the two TVs. The Decor would fit in perfectly, about 20 years ago.

The two signature events of the brand or the so-called managers reception, which currently sucks and the buffet breakfast, which is crowded and keeps running out of food. It was a total madhouse this morning, and they never had all of the trays of food fall at once. People were climbing all over each other trying to find a place to sit.

In summary, it is probably my fault for believing that the hotel wouldn’t operate and charge full price under these circumstances. But it does make me never want to come back to an embassy suites hotel. Even after their so-called upgrades are completed, this hotel will be nothing special and I would never choose to come back again.",November 2018,Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville at Vanderbilt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55229-d223681-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_by_Hilton_Nashville_at_Vanderbilt-Nashville_Davidson_County_Tennessee.html,"Nashville, Tennessee",hotels,2.0,4.0
Just checking out this morning.,"I am just checking out this morning after three nights here at the renaissance Indianapolis north.

First the good: the front desk staff is incredibly pleasant and helpful. The check in process was easy and they take time to orient each customer to the layout of the hotel. Some of the others in our group mentioned that they were actually walk down to the elevator, rather than just having it pointed out to them. The rooms are nicely updated with attractive furnishings and a large TV.

Negative: I didn’t have any say over booking our meeting at this hotel, but I will point out that you are really in the middle of nowhere with difficulty going off property for shopping or dining unless you have a car. We came in straight from the airport, and don’t have any feeling of where we are. I saw another review that referred to this as a “charming” suburb. would probably use a different adjective such as “typical.” After a bunch of grousing from our group, it came out that we could’ve spent a slightly larger amount of money to stay in the city, which everyone wishes that we had.

Although the rooms are attractively updated, and feature some visibly top and six chairs, after a bunch of grousing from our group, it came out that we could’ve spent a slightly larger amount of money to stay in the city, whichever one wishes that we had.

Although the rooms are attractively updated, and features some visibly top-end fixtures, I think they selected aesthetics over practicality when they were being chosen. For example, the groovy looking vanity faucet in the bathroom is actually very cheap feeling and hard to adjust. The showerheads and controls in the shower are even worse. As someone with three advanced degrees, I have to say it took me until the third Day of my stay to fully figure out the shower controls. The mixing valve is located in the middle of the wall facing out into the bathroom, in a perfect location to jam it into your back while you are bending over. The controls are super light such that a 1/8 inch movement switches the water from cold to burning hot. I never thought there was enough water coming out of the groovy looking shower head.

There are other similar missteps in the way the room is furnished. For example, my room as a single king size bed with the little easy chair in the corner facing the TV. What could be a really comfortable place to sit is in reality unbelievably uncomfortable.

As to the bar/restaurant in the lobby, I can easily tell you that it is probably the worst such facility I have ever been to. The service is mind numbingly slow, And the food is some of the worst hotel “cuisine” I have ever had. Not only was my eggs Benedict, probably the worst I’ve had in my life, but it didn’t come with anything other than the two muffins themselves, no hashbrowns, not even a slice of orange on the plate. I would’ve pointed this out to the waitress but she never asked how things were. Similarly, sitting in the bar with our large group, it took an unusually long time for someone to come over and take our order, even though there were about five people behind the bar having some sort of staff meeting. If there was a decent nearby option, we definitely would have walked out.",October 2018,Renaissance Indianapolis North Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g36990-d1006170-Reviews-Renaissance_Indianapolis_North_Hotel-Carmel_Hamilton_County_Indiana.html,"Carmel, Indiana",hotels,3.0,4.5
Reliable transportation,"We are a family with three teenage boys and traveling with them is a challenge. When they were younger, we could get a regular cab to agree to squish them into the backseat. But these days they are all over 6 feet tall and we need transportation that accommodates all of us plus our luggage.

We were very impressed with the service for airport transportation to and from our hotels. Not only were they always there on time, but there were plenty of email confirmations back and forth beforehand confirming exactly what time we would be there, where to meet, etc.

I just wanted to give a plug for being the first person in the gate in the morning. It is a very different experience when you are the only people in there, even when there are tons of folks streaming in behind you.

Good but pricey,"Going to big Bubba’s burgers is a special treat for our kids when we are driving to our beach place on Hartstein Island. We don’t stop here all the time because of the cost, but when we do make the decision to spend the money, we are happy we went.

For example, myself my 14-year-old son and a friend of his stopped in for dinner on the drive down Friday evening. The kids each had a burger and either fries or onion rings and a shake. I had a double burger and a shake. They give you tons of fries, so there were more than enough for the three of us to share.

The cost including tax was around $43. Which for me is a lot of money to spend on what is fast food. But then again, there’s nothing like it around, and I know they’ve got to make their money on the few days when the weather is great and there’s a lot of people passing through. So I don’t blame the owners on the cost, I just want everyone to know that it is a lot more expensive then you might expect it to be.

I do really like the shakes, and it is actually the only place I ever order a shake. My personal preference is either the Cherrier or the raspberry.

I think the onion rings are excellent and worth the stop all by themselves.

Last night in Greece,"We were looking for a highly rated, yet reasonably priced restaurant for our last Night in Greece. After reading a number of online reviews we settled on this place, located behind the Acropolis museum. Although we were happy to have something off the beaten path, we were at first struck by the fact there were only three tables outside (my wife was adamant about eating outdoors for our last meal). But there was a free table, so we delve in.

Even though we’ve been to Greece many times, we were a bit taken aback by the lack of menu. There were items written on the chalkboard posted outside, and a couple of extra items that were available in the kitchen. The host invited us to walk in the kitchen and look at our choices. It’s funny, I’ve heard about this many times about eating in Greece, but always felt funny actually going in the kitchen. So this is the first time I’ve ever done that.

At first we ordered a half liter of white wine, which I have to say was the best bulk wine we’ve had after our month-long stay in Greece. It was so good we ordered a second half liter (although I have to say we didn’t finish the second one). My wife and I split a horiatiki salad and some stuffed zucchini. I’ve read a few negative reviews on this place that said the food was swimming in a while, and all I can say is that those folks obviously don’t understand Greek cooking. It wasn’t swimming in oil in the bad sense, you could just tell that they gave you a lot of the sauce with the entrée.

Moving on from there, my wife and I had to Bridget ideas about what to do, so instead of sharing, we each ordered our own entrée. I went with my old standby, broiled pork chops. My wife had Mousaka. My wife said this was the best move Sekyra that she has had in Greece (ever). Certainly as good as that made by her Greek grandmother. My Porkchop was excellent, very tender, and not overcooked as in some similar restaurants. It was also a generously sized piece.

We were feeling really tired and had to wake up at 4 AM for our outgoing flight, so skipped the obligatory watermelon after the meal.

Our ‘go to’ hotel,"Frankly, we don’t care for Athens. It is merely a means to an end, to get in and out of the country as we travel to the islands and more interesting destinations. When we are in Athens, we are looking for simple accommodations, conveniently located, that we know we can trust. Also, a rooftop deck with a beautiful view of the Acropolis doesn’t hurt.

We stayed here multiple times in the past and spent two nights before leaving after a month in Greece. Given the location, and the quality of the hotel, I think this is a very value and will continue to return the future.

It is not perfect, but there are easily hotels that are only slightly better for twice as much money per night. They have a very good breakfast buffet, and again, the view from the rooftop deck cannot be beat.

The worst of our trip,"After checking out of this hotel, I did a little online research and Learned that this hotel is for sale. Honestly, I think what is going on is that they are substantially cutting corners to make their books look good (high income and low expenses) to a purchaser.

We stay in a lot of hotels in this price category, so it is not as if we are expecting a Mercedes on a Volkswagen budget. The rooms were poorly maintained, and the breakfast was the absolute skimpiest and worst food we had at any of the 10 different hotels we stayed at during this particular month-long trip.

I don’t want to imply that it was uninhabitable or something like that. I just want to make it clearly known that I’m sure they were better choices that we could have made, and I wish our travel agent had suggested somewhere else instead. Of course, she has the listing for the sale of the business, so I think that is why we were placed here.",August 2018,Hotel Galini,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1191369-d608619-Reviews-Hotel_Galini-Skala_Eresou_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",hotels,2.0,4.5
Glad I took the quick detour,"I was on the way down from visiting the top of the road that leads to the trails up Mount Olympus, and passed the turn off for this monastery. I had thought better of it and decided to turn around, go back up the hill and see what it was all about.

The signs were unclear as to where to park, so I parked in an upper parking lot. I don’t walk down closer to the monastery, and saw that there were numerous other cars parked in the lower area. So if you do visit, I would encourage anyone to go past the paved lot and closer to the monastery.

At first I thought this would be an abandoned monastery, but there were church service is going on when I was there. There was a sign that said not to enter if you were not properly dressed, and since I was coming down from a hike on Mount Olympus, I psychic better not to look inside.

My wife didn’t like the twisty Mountain Road and asked that we turn around and head back down.

So the next morning, while she was at our hotel doing exercises, I decided to drive up myself. I’m so glad I did and I got some wonderful pictures of the mountain, the trails, and the views going both up and down the hill.

At breakfast I showed my wife the photos and she was so amazed, that she asked me to drive her back up the hill. So I did the entire check back up and down Mount Olympus twice on the same day.

So, with little advance planning, we stumbled across this world class (5 star) hotel. The pool area was very nice. There were a lot of kids in the pool, but we think that is great even if a little noisy. We were not traveling with children, but we certainly remember what it was like.

The spa services were good quality and reasonably priced. The breakfast (included) was excellent, certainly among the top several during our one month in Greece (we were only here 3 nights). Our room had a great view (which they upgraded us to from the one with a mountain view). The shower and bathroom were very nice (not always the case in Greece, even in the nicest places).

Excellent,"We ate here twice during our three day stay in the nearby Olympus Resort. During our first visit we had calamari and octopus. During our second visit we had Dorado and pork souvlaki. Both times we had a Greek salad which was literally the best we have had during our month in Greece.

The owner is a “host” in the truest sense of the word. The restaurant business is a hard one, but he really seems to love taking care of his customers and making sure they are happy.

In addition to the normal small sweet given at the end of dinner (typically watermelon or something similar), he also provided another type of glyko (I think it was harithopita) and several glasses of masticha. Then to top it off, he provided bags of fruit to take home. On the first visit we thought this was something extra he was doing for us, but on closer observation, he seems to do this for everyone!

Just so.,"We stopped in for a couple of gyros this evening. My wife had it with everything, which includes mustard and ketchup. I think that those condiments have no business whatsoever being in a Gyro, so I asked that those be kept off.

My wife was actually happy with her gyro, Which actually surprised me.

I thought mine was pretty tasteless. The tzaziki had no flavor (maybe that’s why they put on ketchup and mustard), And frankly, although I ordered pork, I really couldn’t tell if it was pork or chicken. In other words, the meat had no flavor either.

It wasn’t a bad gyro but I’ve had much better.",July 2018,Meating,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1450327-d8556373-Reviews-Meating-Mytilene_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Wife was happy,"My wife was desperate for some ice cream after wandering around the shopping areas of Mytilini. All I can say is this what is satisfying at a nice place to sit.

Really nicely appointed rooms.,"We mostly stay in more modest accommodations while traveling in Greece, but our travel agent booked us here hour last night on Lesvos. At first, we were concerned about being far away from town, but we have a rental car so it’s a short drive and not a problem. Although this isn’t the best location in the world for doing anything other than being close to the airport, the plus is that this is the nicest hotel room I’ve ever stayed in while traveling in Greece. I don’t know exactly what category of room we are in, but it consists of a bedroom area and a separate sitting area divided by a sliding door. There are two televisions here, one in each area. The mini bar area is really long, and the bathroom is the biggest we’ve ever had in a Greek hotel. The shower area is modern with a really nice range of spray nozzles. The bathroom has a very nice large counter so you can spread out your personal things. For example we were at a really nice hotel earlier in the week, but it was just a freestanding sink, so there wasn’t even anywhere to leave your toothbrush.

I think the hotel is undergoing renovations at the moment, but there doesn’t seem to be any unusual noise or anything. There just seem to be a lot of workmen outside.

We won’t be able to try the breakfast until the morning, but the breakfast area looks like a nice place. It is very bright, modern and clean.",July 2018,Elysion HOTEL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2642384-d1840429-Reviews-Elysion_HOTEL-Neapoli_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Worst ever!,"Three weeks into our one month stay in Greece, we have a new winner of absolute worst restaurant we have ever been to. Not only was the food awful, but the owner was rude and menacing.

We chose to visit here on the recommendation of another website. We visited on a Monday night, and we were the only patrons there at approximately 9 PM. Instead of taking that as a warning sign, We thought we were visiting a “hidden gem”.

No one in the establishment spoke English, which is usually not a problem for us, as we speak basic conversational Greek. Here is a rundown of what we ordered and our reaction to each item.

The bread they served had to be at least two or three days old. We are talking about the kind of bread that you can pound on the edge of the table and break the table.

The horiatiki salad was actually one of the best we’ve had in Greece, it was large and included a nice selection of vegetables and olives.

We ordered tzaziki which never arrived.

We ordered octopus, which was pretty much inedible. My wife took one bite and spit it out, and fed the rest to the cats that were wandering under the table. Again, we are folks that love to eat octopus in Greece and have it regularly. It is not like we don’t know what to expect regarding texture or flavor.

We ordered something that was a sort of tuna steak, but it was clearly mushy and old. Maybe they thought we were stupid tourists who didn’t know any better.

We ordered one other fresh fish item, which again never came (sorry can’t remember the name, or description, since it never came).

After waiting for a very long time, we asked for the bill, which included all the items, including those that did not arrive.

We argued with the owner for quite some time, trying to point out the mistakes in the bill, but frankly he was threatening and menacing and we thought it was best just to pay and leave.

Please understand that we’ve been to Greece many many times and ate at literally hundreds of restaurants and this was by far the worst experience we have ever had in this country.",July 2018,Akrotiri Fish Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g663827-d10089465-Reviews-Akrotiri_Fish_Tavern-Vatera_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Good pizza,"We stopped in for a quick drink and perhaps a snack last evening (our first in Vatera). I ordered a mai tai, which was on the drinks menu, and what I received was about as far from a mai tai as you could find. They seemed to take a shot of rum, and combine it in a short class with some lemon or lime juice, and that was it.

But we did order a margarita pizza, which we thought was very very good. I’m not sure what kind of cheese they use, but is much saltier than the mozzarella you would find in the US. Overall it was a great cheap dinner, notwithstanding my strange drink.",July 2018,Blue Macao,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g663827-d10539518-Reviews-Blue_Macao-Vatera_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Good pizza,"Stopped in here during a visit to Manhattan Beach when we didn’t want to spend too much for dinner. But because he is a teenager and a big eater, the two of us purchase three pizzas. That was a little too much food, and we had some leftovers to take home, but it gave us an opportunity to try multiple different pizzas. Pizza is about the crust and this place has very good crust. The toppings are unique and they are cooked quickly. Overall, I’d be happy to visit here again in the future.",June 2018,Pitfire Artisan Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32678-d3862796-Reviews-Pitfire_Artisan_Pizza-Manhattan_Beach_California.html,"Manhattan Beach, California",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Truly cheap eats,"My wife and I had spent the earlier part of the evening at Patasol, Having some pretty expensive drinks. So we decided we wanted to find the cheapest good eats in town. Trip Advisor led us here.

I had a plate of pork skewers, my wife had a hero and a separate side order of potatoes. I also had a large draft beer.

The total bill was €13 which was definitely a great thing for our budget.

Most of the other customers while we were there were groups of local children out for a Friday night. It’s seem to be the great hang out for them and was just fine for us.

Tonight is our last night in town, and we will probably go back again.",July 2018,Gialos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1191369-d10719844-Reviews-Gialos-Skala_Eresou_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Disappointing,"After reading great reviews on this website and others we definitely play the captains table on our list of restaurants to dine at while in Molyvos. While the third was not terrible (I don’t think any restaurant in Greece is actually awful), It was the least satisfactory meal we have had so far in our month-long visit to Greece.

First, scanning the restaurants along the harbor, it was one of the least full with customers. Most Greek restaurants have a serviceable carafe style wine but there’s was the worst we have had.

We had ceviche, which was adequate but not spectacular. We had octopus which was the driest, toughest, most flavorless octopus we have had in Greece (And please note I have octopus probably every other day for dinner). We had horta, which was fine but nothing special. Lastly, we had Dakos, Which is basically Greek bruschetta and hard to mess up.

So let me make it clear, the food was not awful. It was only sub par and disappointing.

FYI, we ate at octopus the following night, and were thoroughly pleased. I strongly recommend that anyone go there instead.",July 2018,The Captain's Table,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1191013-d1079113-Reviews-The_Captain_s_Table-Molyvos_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Our best meal in Molyvos,"After being disappointed at the Captains table the previous night, and us noticing substantially bigger crowds at the octopus, we decided to eat there our final evening in Molyvos.

The service was excellent, the wharf front table was fabulous. This place had her extensive wine list and we chose a red wine from Nemea. The squid in olive oil and lemon was excellent, But the real reason we came here was to have a whole Seabass. This is the kind of fish my wife would never be back home, but absolutely loved to try in Greece.

If we ever make it back to Molyvos again we will surely visit the octopus our first night.",July 2018,The Octapus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1191013-d2628759-Reviews-The_Octapus-Molyvos_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
A nice place to rest,"We went here for a quick rest our first day in Molyvos. My wife had a frappe and I had a beer. We later came back for dessert the next day. It’s really no different than any other similar place in Greece, but the location is excellent and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.",July 2018,Sea Horse Cafe-Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1191013-d2562360-Reviews-Sea_Horse_Cafe_Restaurant-Molyvos_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Fun tiki bar,"I am a sucker for tiki bars and I think that every place in the world should have one. So our travel agent suggested we go here for our first drink. My wife and I normally drink red wine but they had really fun looking tiki style drinks.

I had a mai tai and I don’t remember the name of my wife’s drink, but it was based on meds calm, which is something she would normally never have. I can only say that she thoroughly enjoyed her drink, and she is not a big drinker.

We had a great time here and watch the sunset, I couldn’t imagine being in town and having drinks anywhere else.",July 2018,Flamingo Beach Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1191369-d6991694-Reviews-Flamingo_Beach_Bar-Skala_Eresou_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Fun tiki style bar,"I am a big sucker for tiki bars. I’m so glad this place is on the beach here. My wife is not a big drinker but definitely was willing to have a tall Mezcal based drink, which he says was fantastic. I had a mai tai which was good but not great.

But I love the decor and the music and I am very happy we went. I’m sure will be back again during our visit.",July 2018,Parasol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1191369-d4554573-Reviews-Parasol-Skala_Eresou_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent,"We usually stay in pretty modest accommodations when traveling in Greece. The travel agent we are using for our trip to Lesvos made us a reservation here for the first three nights.

When we first checked in, I was thinking what the heck is this? It seemed a little over-the-top and not the traditional Greek hotel we are accustomed to.

Because we did not make the reservation directly, I do not know what specific type of room we were in. I can say is that it was a beautiful room with a very nice modernBathroom, excellent furnishings and was an absolutely dropdead view.

The breakfast buffet was the best we have ever had in Greece, and I say that as somebody who is probably stayed in 50 or more hotels in Greece over the years. The hotel staff was over the top accommodating, and my wife’s even bought a present for the woman at the reception desk when we checked out, she was so appreciative of their services.

We did switch rooms after the first night, because I had difficulty negotiating the stairways as I have bad knees. So we moved to a room at the very top of the hotel, where I could park the rental car behind and walk down without too many steps.

There are two pools here and they are both in excellent condition, with a small snack bar at the lower one.

We were really taken with this place and if we ever return to this island, we will definitely want to come to this hotel again. Lastly, let me say this was a very unusual place for us to stay, very different from our normal accommodations, but we are really glad we were booked here by our travel agent.

By the way, the picture is obviously a view from the pool, looking up to our room which is in the highest section of the hotel from this perspective.",July 2018,Sunrise Resort Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1191869-d1225550-Reviews-Sunrise_Resort_Hotel-Eftalou_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
