"Fabulous view, lovely staff and good food","Visited here twice on our recent visit to the area - once for lunch and the other for dinner. Hadn't realised the Eat Out to Help Out promotion was on when we went for lunch (first day!) and the place was very busy! The girls on duty were rushed off their feet and some people were not very patient but we had no complaints as could see they were being bombarded. We just had one soup and one cheesecake, with a coffee each. Delighted it was half price at £7.50 total! Can't complain at that - and the view is magnificent over the golf course to the sea. Also went here for dinner on the Thurs and we were the only table in at 8pm (no promotion!) Service great and the fish and chips delicious. Would recommend.",August 2020,Newburgh on Ythan Golf Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g191276-d3296737-Reviews-Newburgh_on_Ythan_Golf_Club-Ellon_Aberdeenshire_Scotland.html,"Ellon, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Super views but steep climb,"Mither Tap is part of the Bennachie Range and is a very popular hill to climb. It has superb paths to the top but it is quite steep and shouldn't be undertaken lightly!! Having said that, lots of children were going up with families! There is a Pictish fort at the top too (wouldn't have wanted that job!) and the views are worth the effort. Good car park at the bottom (free at moment as visitor centre and toilets are closed due to virus) and well signposted. If you are so inclined, might want to go on and explore other hills in the range that are visible from the top!!",August 2020,The Mither Tap Aberdeen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186487-d5916393-Reviews-The_Mither_Tap_Aberdeen-Aberdeen_Aberdeenshire_Scotland.html,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,2.0
Beautiful,"You Park just a short distance from the beach - walk through the dunes - and suddenly are on the beach and watching the seals! Not too many on the beach (on the opposite side to where you walk) when we were there but lots of birdlife. And you watch the seals in the water (watching you!) We were there twice over the course of our break and it was different each time. In the afternoon, lots of action in the water and of you walk round to the beach from the estuary, we saw lots of seals in the sea and they were 'singing'!! Second visit, I walked the 6 miles from Balmedie to Newburgh in the early evening on a near deserted beach (stunning) and the seals at Newburgh were all on the beach resting (again, on the opposite side of the estuary so no danger) Sunset lovely and a different experience to the first visit. Sore feet too - but would do it again. Wonderful....",August 2020,Newburgh Seals Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551906-d14005002-Reviews-Newburgh_Seals_Beach-Newburgh_Aberdeenshire_Scotland.html,"Newburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Amazing place, but sad to see","What an incredible place this must have been in its heyday. You can look around the buildings (free) and just wonder what it must have been like back in time and in its many incantations.... Unfortunately, the roof was removed in the 1920's to avoid taxes and this wonderful building just left to the elements... It's right on the coast and there are signs for you to be careful around the cliffs.. Apparently the octagonal room inside was inspirational for Bram Stoker when he wrote Dracula. Well worth a shortish walk from Cruden Bay to this atmospheric place....",August 2020,Slains Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186487-d206562-Reviews-Slains_Castle-Aberdeen_Aberdeenshire_Scotland.html,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Superb beach and great coastal walk,"Fabulous beach - but would also recommend the coastal walk to Portknockie and back. Scenery is stunning (we were lucky as it was a beautiful day) and also lots of birdlife to see. Apparently you may be lucky enough to see Dolphins too (but unfortunately, we didn't...) Came back along the converted railway track (great for either cycling or walking) which also offered superb views.",August 2020,Cullen Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1097167-d4172570-Reviews-Cullen_Beach-Cullen_Moray_Scotland.html,"Cullen, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5

Excellent museum - very interesting!,This is a superb museum - you get a headset included in the admission price of £10 (£9 if booked online) which gives an interesting tour of the prison and gives insight into life there up until it's closure in 2013. Also goes into the riots in the late 1980's. Great cafe at the end of the tour - chat to the lovely lady in there for more interesting history!

Fabulous food and staff,"Superb restaurant at the New Inn Hotel. Great selection of dishes and each one we tried while staying at the hotel was excellent. Staff were very friendly and efficient. Tracy, Linda and Petros deserve special
mention as our main servers and all superb (no bad staff at this place!) Highlight dishes were the cornkist chicken, haddock and prawn melt, haddock and leek risotto, creme brûlée and homemade cheesecake.

"Fabulous hotel, great staff, delicious food","Visited here for a 5 day break and had a fantastic stay. Hotel was totally on the ball with Covid procedures - breakfast was served in the room and was hot and bang on time each day. Hotel was immaculate. Staff were
very professional, friendly and engaging. The hotel restaurant - The Cornkist - was superb. Great food and staff - and we benefitted from the 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme! Was so good that we ate there every night! Particular mention goes to Tracy, Linda and Petros for their care and attention. (All staff good but we dealt mostly with these and couldn't fault them) Good value at £89 B&B for double room. Ellon a lovely wee town on the River Ythan (nice riverside walks just over the road from the hotel) and a good base for visiting the area. Don't miss a trip to Newburgh 5 miles away for the Seal Beach and walks along the coast. Also for beer lovers, the Brewdog Brewery and Bar are in Ellon (a mile out of town - walk after dinner!)

Superb castle,"This is a small but very interesting castle in the centre of busy Newcastle! It has a gate house (The Black Gate) and the Keep, with museum rooms in each and the buildings are separated by a railway built by the Victorians! You can also get onto the roof of the keep with great views over the city. Lots of interesting information and rooms to explore. £8.50 entry a bit steep but the castle obviously needs maintained!

Wonderful Historical Abbey,What an amazing place this is! Dates back so long in history and can easily spend a couple of hours exploring it all. It's free entry but donations gratefully received. The staff on duty were so helpful and answered any questions enthusiastically. Don't miss the crypt which is the oldest part of the Abbey. So much to see and admire!

Great food and service,"We are here on Monday evening and had a delicious meal. Started with shared nachos and then I had a special of chicken breast with dauphinoise potatoes and hubby had the steak and ale pie. The chicken was moist and tasty and the dauphinoise and other vegetables were perfectly cooked and delicious. Gravy was served separately in a sauce boat! The pie was fantastic - big flaky pastry crust on top of a pan filled to the top with big chunks of meat and mushrooms. So many times have been disappointed with poor fillings at other venues - only a few pieces of meat swimming in gravy - but this was exceptional! And tender too! Served with chunky fries and vegetables - hubby couldn't finish them! We had a glass of wine each and hubby also had a pint. Came in at under £50 - well worth it. Staff were great. Only negative was that it was a little chilly - extremely cold night outside and we ate in quite a large room. Not a lot of people on a Monday in February! However, would recommend. There is outdoor seating overlooking the river which would be fab on a warm evening...",February 2020,The Anchor Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g776121-d2366952-Reviews-The_Anchor_Restaurant-Haydon_Bridge_Hexham_Northumberland_England.html,"Haydon Bridge, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Fabulous food with great traditional service,"Ate here when staying at the hotel and had the set menu at £44.95 a head. It is pricey but was a treat and didn't disappoint! Pre-dinner drinks are taken in the drawing room, where menus are given out and orders taken before you are escorted down to your table. An 'amuse bouche' is served before your starter - was very tasty. We had the beetroot carpaccio and the ravioli, followed by the beef and the loin of pork. All wonderfully presented and delicious. Desserts were just as tasty - we shared the creme brûlée and a wonderful rhubarb medley. Fine wine also served. They also have a gueridon trolley and we saw crepe suzettes being prepared at another table. It's old style and formal but relaxed (no dinner jackets required!) and excellent service.

Luxury in historical setfing,"Stayed 2 nights here on a Groupon deal and had a wonderful time. The castle dates from the 14th century and was lovingly restored to its former glory at the beginning of the 20th century - and been a hotel since the 1990's. We didn't stay in the actual hotel but in the converted outbuildings overlooking it but the room was superb. A huge bed, great bathroom and all the facilities you would expect (tea/coffee, tv, wifi, toiletries, iron, hairdryer..) The decor is very much in keeping with the castle too. We had dinner one night and it was delicious. Fine dining in elegant surroundings. The staff are excellent - very attentive without being overbearing. The breakfast was also superb. After breakfast on the first morning, we joined other guests on a tour of the castle which was really interesting. Couldn't get up on the roof unfortunately due to the weather but it was still great to see how the castle used to run and how well it has been transformed without taking away the original features. A film at the end explained the history in more detail. This was a fabulous break and we hope to return one day.

Superb stadium,This was one of our favourite visits! The whole stadium is made from marble and was rebuilt for the modern Olympic Games in 1896 (although it has been there in some form for much longer - since gladiator times!!) Was only €5 to go in and had an interesting audio tour included. All the Olympic torches from each of the games since 1896 are displayed in a room inside the stadium and you can walk down the passageway that both gladiators and olympians walked down into the stadium. Very atmospheric... Have your photo taken on the podiums and take a run on the track!!

Expensive and over-rated,The actual square in Temple Bar was not a nice place to be in - maybe because it was a Friday? Lots of drunken people lying about - even before it got late. the lanes in the area are interesting with tourist style shops and the bars have live music - but you pay for the pleasure! A gin and tonic and a pint of guiness cost over 17 euros. Ridiculous!!

Slightly creepy but another must see,This gaol is another must see venue in Dublin - it follows on the story of the uprsing from the GPO and you see the cells that the prisoners were kept in - and the area they were executed...

Wonderful shopping and atmosphere,We visited during the Arts festival so the place was buzzing!! Very busy but a wonderful atmosphere with street entertainment and buskers. The street is totally pedestrianised so you can amble down at your leisure and peruse the plentiful individual shops (not a lot of chain stores here!) selling everything you could imagine!

Absolutely first class!,"We were recommended to go here and are so glad we did! It was very busy as the International Arts Festival is on - but we managed to get a table and were served very quickly. Good deal at €23.50 for 2 courses and a small glass of wine. I had leek and potato soup followed by battered cod and chips. Hubby had mussels in a Thai coconut milk and lime, followed by baked cod layered in a mild curry sauce. The wine was lovely too. Service was without fault - friendly and very efficient (Polish lady - brilliant!) Could not recommend highly enough! There is also a fish and chip shop as part of the eatery with separate dining areas, if that's what you prefer.

Packed out and uncomfortable,"Travelled from Cairnryan to Larne on 13th July. This is one of the most expensive ferries we have been on and was one of the worst experiences! Although the ferry arrived safely and on time, there was a lack of comfortable seating on board. One small TV lounge (with a broken seat at the front too!) and a large crowded area at the other end did not lend itself to a relaxing trip. I just wanted a comfy seat and to be able to have a wee nap! No chance!! Space taken up with separate lounges that you have to pay extra for is not the answer? It was too windy and cold to sit outside for any length of time and I spent time wandering around trying to find somewhere to sit - eventually squeezing in beside a couple in the large lounge. These seats are not designed to snooze in though! It annoys me that having paid so much for the crossing, I can't relax on board unless I am willing to pay even more!

Almost too much to take in but very interesting and it's free to go in - so you could go again! Very well laid out with some interactive displays too. Staff extremely friendly and helpful.

There are photos and letters from passengers who
were on the ship during its maiden voyage before the last fatal stage to New York. (I hadn't realised it had picked up (and dropped off) passengers in Ireland and France before sailing for USA.) It took you through the tragedy with voices from survivors and then told about the aftermath... as well as showing you about the people who have gone down to see the ship in its final resting place.

Pricey but nice,"Came for dinner. Presentation of the food was very good and it was all tasty. Only negative was slightly soggy duck fat chips - thought they would be very crisp. I watched plates being put up under the hot lamps for a while as the dishes were completed and maybe this is the reason the chips were not as crisp as they could be? It's not the cheapest place as bill came to almost £80 - we had a drink and also half carafe of wine, but only one pud and one coffee. Service was very good and there is a good vibe in this place.

She took the orders and was ably assisted by junior staff who brought the food - which, incidentally, was lovely! I had soup and half a toasted baguette (Bacon, Brie and redcurrant jelly) The soup was hearty homemade mushroom and was truly delicious - as was the baguette. Sister-in-law had a ham baguette.

Good desserts - I had ice cream with mandarins and chocolate from the fountain and a small tiramisu. Very good!! The restaurant was busy but not full and there was a good atmosphere.

Fabulous - and free!!,This is a superb exhibition of Lowry paintings with a very informative film at the beginning. What a sad lonely man - but with the ability to paint incredible pictures. Well worth the visit. Loved it!,April 2019,The Lowry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g503819-d583268-Reviews-The_Lowry-Salford_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Salford, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good value for money,"Visited here twice this week. Took mum and dad for dinner on Thursday - £6.99 for carvery dinner. Good selection of meat - pork, turkey and beef. Yorkshire puds a must - especially with gravy! There were plenty of vegetables and all tasty. Some of the dishes can get a bit dry if been out for a while but all in all, worth the money. We shared an ice cream sundae and each had a drink - came in at about £31 total. This morning (Sunday), 7 of us went for breakfast. It was an all you can eat buffet at £4.99, which included toast and pancakes. There was a decent selection of items - sausage, bacon, hash browns, mushrooms, tomatoes, beans, Yorkshire puds! (obviously a speciality of Toby's!), potatoes, and fried/scrambled eggs. As expected on buffets, the fried eggs weren't great and the scrambled eggs a bit dry - but ok. Wish they did sachets of jam/marmalade instead of a bowl everyone has to take out of! And £1.99 for tea/coffee a bit steep (compared to the food) - especially as the coffee was rotten! (Very little coffee flavour and kept warm in jugs on heated rings...) Pancakes were lovely - especially toasted with butter!! Wish they would have OJ included in price. All in all tho, at just over £7 a head, was value for money.",April 2019,Toby Carvery Bolton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187053-d919251-Reviews-Toby_Carvery_Bolton-Bolton_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Bolton, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Amazing food! Great deal!,"Was bought an Itison deal as a birthday present and what an amazing experience! Superb food - we had a potato and cheese soup appetiser - followed by smoked salmon, then I had the seabass and hubby had the lamb. Both incredible - although hubby could have eaten more (just one piece of lamb!) The seabass was cooked to perfection and served with amazing sauce, broccoli and potatoes. I had the chocolate delice pud and hubby had cheese. This deal (£49 for 2) comes with a glass of champagne and also tea/coffee (served with homemade shortbread and a choc) Good Value for such fine dining. The service (Katie) was flawless. We did order a bottle of wine which was delicious but expensive at £39 - plus VAT!! A glass would have been enough - but we don't regret it and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. Lovely surroundings too. This deal comes out now and again - watch out for it and treat yourselves!!",March 2019,Hotel du Vin at One Devonshire Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186534-d187751-Reviews-Hotel_du_Vin_at_One_Devonshire_Gardens-Glasgow_Scotland.html,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent food and service!,"Visited here on Monday 1st April and had a fabulous experience. The food is wonderful - we all enjoyed it. I had the avocado caprese for starter - a bit different! The avocado had been balled and put back into the skin with small mozzarella balls and tomatoes. Scrummy. Couldn't see beyond the beef stroganoff and it didn't disappoint. Delicious tender beef in a creamy sauce - served with pilau rice. The men both had the specials lamb dish - very tender lamb (lots of it) with salad and Parmesan shavings served on wooden boards. Both loved it. We shared a very generous portion of tiramisu which was also delicious. The host has a great knowledge of wine and we had a vegan, organic red which was lovely. If you are in Peebles, don't miss a visit to this great eatery - also has a lovely view over the river!",April 2019,Francos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186508-d2220604-Reviews-Francos-Peebles_Scottish_Borders_Scotland.html,"Peebles, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great coffee shop!,"Popped in last weekend for a coffee and pleasantly surprised to be served good HOT coffee and a pot of tea (that did 2 cups!) with a tasty tray bake. The seating area is quite small but they open up a hatch and have seating outside too when it's warm, apparently! Gentleman serving was very friendly and knowledgeable of local area too - if you are needing a coffee - or a bike!! - would highly recommend.",March 2019,Aberfoyle Bike Hire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186579-d15771136-Reviews-Aberfoyle_Bike_Hire-Aberfoyle_Loch_Lomond_and_The_Trossachs_National_Park_Scotla.html,"Aberfoyle, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
Amazing Building and great exhibition,"It's an incredible building - so cleverly designed. Was packed out as it was the last weekend of exhibition. All very interesting - the Scottish section makes you realise how much great stuff is produced here! Liner exhibition very good too - quite pricey but as the Scottish bit free, it all evens out. Had fantastic lunch here in the restaurant - at a window table, incredible views! Staff fantastic too.

Nice rooms and good breakfast,"Came to this hotel as it was advertised as having a restaurant, bar, pool and spa - as well as lovely rooms and grounds. The building is lovely - like a small castle as you drive up the driveway. However, when we arrived to a warm welcome, we were informed that there was no restaurant but that hopefully it would be available the following evening. We then found out that the pool and spa were not open either and that the hotel was recovering from having gone into receivership the previous year. The room was comfortable if a little cramped (beds very comfy though) and the breakfast on each of our two mornings was good. The bistro restaurant was open the following day but we had already booked at the Ada Turkish restaurant in town, which we really wanted to visit. It is a shame that the pool,etc were not available. There were huge dehumidifiers just along from our room all the time we were there - which was a little noisy!! But it didn't keep us awake. The lounge was very warm and cosy and would be a lovely place to have a drink before dinner. Hopefully the bistro will be successful and the hotel can get back to being the luxury establishment it deserves to be.
Be sure to visit Elgin Cathdral while you are there - wonderful place! Everything in the town is within walking distance of the hotel.

Excellent wee cafe!,Nipped in for a quick bite and had a thoroughly scrummy lunch. Hubby and I both had Cullen Skink and a half sandwich. Also a Hawaiian slice. Very busy place - lots of kids as it was half term. Great selection of food - friendly and efficient staff. Very reasonable too!

Amazing cathedral and carved stones,"Rejoined Historic Scotland on this trip and enjoyed the benefit at this glorious cathedral. Has been on site for 800 years and suffered lots of attacks, collapses and bad weather - but is STILL here to be visited and admired. Climb to the top of the left tower if you are able - the views are worth the effort. The stones are superb - saved in the 19th century by an eager historian from the rubble after the central tower collapse and some look like they were done yesterday! Really worth a visit.",February 2019,Elgin Cathedral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186558-d502965-Reviews-Elgin_Cathedral-Elgin_Moray_Scotland.html,"Elgin, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fabulous food and service,"Read the reviews and couldn't wait to try here on a visit from Glasgow. (We did actually try and go the previous night - but it is shut on Sundays)
Shared the mixed mezze platter - all food absolutely gorgeous! Highly recommend. Then hubby had a tiger prawn dish and I had an aubergine and chicken dish - both outstanding. The rice served with both dishes is wonderful and tasty too. Shared a pud - can't remember the name but was Turkish pastry with ice cream and pistachio - delicious! Hubby had a Turkish coffee and liqueur. Bill came in at £75 (also had a bottle of Pinot grigot at £19) so not the cheapest place but not too pricy and worth every penny. Service was fast and efficient too. Only negative was that it was chilly sitting against the wall. Try and get a table in the middle of restaurant - in Winter anyway!!",February 2019,Ada Turkish Restauarant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186558-d12029906-Reviews-Ada_Turkish_Restauarant-Elgin_Moray_Scotland.html,"Elgin, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great place,Visited last night (Sunday 10th Feb) and had an enjoyable meal. Shared a cheese fondu starter which was delicious and then I had the duck pizza while hubby had the risotto. Both very tasty. Also shared an ice cream dessert which was lovely. We had a bottle of Pinot grigot and the bill came to £47. Very full and very satisfied! Staff were good - but would suggest a wee bell or something so that the kitchen can let staff know an order is ready.

Fabulous fresh food!,"Visited here last night (a Saturday) with friends. They had been before but myself and my husband hadn't. They said it was fabulous - and how right they were! Started with popadoms with garnishes - have to say that these are the best popadoms we have ever eaten - fresh and crisp and delicious! You have to try them..... then had 2 staters between us - chicken Chaat and Chicken pakora - both wonderful. Bit of a kick but not too much.... the (very pleasant and efficient) waiter also brought a 'freebie' - chicken wings, which were scrummy. I had Lamb Malaidar for main course - cooked with fresh spinach, lots of garlic and cream. Can't begin to tell you how delicious it was - simply divine. Not too garlicy and quite rich. Spicy without blowing your head off - so you can still taste the meat. It was so good... friends and husband had bhoona dishes and the Mattar paneer, all of which were declared as wonderful. 2 naan breads and a rice were our accompaniments, 2 of us had a glass of wine and the others had soft drinks. We simply couldn't manage a dessert or coffee - were so full. Came in at less than £20 a head - amazing value for such fabulous food. Only negative was that it was such a cold night and every time the door opened, you got a blast of cold air. Ideally should have some sort of vestibule to avoid the diners getting so cold. But everything else so brilliant - can forgive them this! Will definitely be back - can't recommend highly enough.",January 2019,Charcoals cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186534-d4506986-Reviews-Charcoals_cafe-Glasgow_Scotland.html,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
