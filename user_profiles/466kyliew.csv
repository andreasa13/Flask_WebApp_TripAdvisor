Bhuwana hotel Ubud,"Stayed here for 8 nights as we were
Staying the whole time in Ubud.
We found there is so much to do in Ubud.

We loved our stay here and found most days when we sat by the pool there was hardly anyone around.

So relaxing here and quiet - only downside is the pool deck is in terrible shape and in need of repair. Didn’t walk across it with no shoes on. The boards are all
Uneven and popping up..

They don’t sell alcohol onsite or in restaurant which is fine as we found around the corner some other restaurants that sold it , but the hotel do the most beautiful juices and we felt like we were being healthy not drinking during the day.

Rooms are just basic and need renovating but are extremely clean and have everything you need so didnt find it a problem.

Extremely Reasonably priced and loved fact we were out of humdrum of busy Ubud. So quiet and loved the fact rice paddy fields behind hotel. Also loved the hotel grew own produce for kitchen.

Sacred rice a must in Ubud,"We had read reviews about sacred rice and when we looked it up to our surprise it was just a 5 minute walk where we were staying in Bhuwana Ubud hotel.

This was The best meal we had in ubud. It was a lot of money compared to other restaurants we were eating at in Ubud apx $180 AUD but that for 2 people having 5 course menu which included desert - our daughters meal chicken and rice. 5 wines-2 cocktails and 2 juices.

it’s fine dining and it’s not a big place so you need to book and We took our 10 year old daughter with us and this was not a problem.
The cocktails were amazing and the wine was very nice - the drinks are expensive by Bali standards but in comparison to what you would pay in Australia this is an à la cart fine dining restaurant that is very reasonably priced for what you get in such a tranquil amazing setting. We absolutely Loved the food.

The gardens are superb and so well manicured. All produce from gardens are used in restaurants even down to the straws. We had a tour of the garden before dinner and so glad we did.

Ubud Karen magical rice fields walk,"We read about this walk on trip advisor and thought it sounded great. It’s a must to do - we are so glad we did this.
The start of the walk is right next to lotus cafe which is next to Saraswati temple.

At first you follow a narrow concrete pathway and you think your not going on the right direction but continue to follow you will be pleasantly surprised. You leave behind the hussle and bustle of Ubud shops and end up in farmland overlooking Balinese houses, rice paddies and beautiful scenery. We only bumped into a few people on this walk. We stopped at Sweet orange cafe which had great juices after a hot day walking. It was a lovely warang and staff so so friendly.

We then continued on our walk and stopped off at Nyoman who sells coconuts. He cut one open for us and we drank the juice and he made a spoon so we could eat the inside - beautiful and lovely man...
