Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, really good sized rooms with plenty of room. Not much kitchen equipment and the bathrooms although recently refurbished were a bit small with large sink spaces and not much space between the shower unit (glass sliding doors) and the sink side (also glass).

The pool area is clean and plenty of beds (due to covid there wasnt many beds or guests but still more than enough). The pool bar had limited drinks in the self service fridge and limited ice creams. However there was no other food available and sadly no offer of a hot meal durning the medicane. The pool bar wasnt open at any point only so we could pay for drinks or ice cream. We werent told that the pool bar was otherwise closed as any point.

The hotel itself is situated between the main road and beach less than a 10 min walk either way.",September 2020,Kalidonio Studios,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g659629-d786421-Reviews-Kalidonio_Studios-Kalamaki_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5

Lovely greek place,"Lovely greek place just down the old kalamaki road towards the beach. Friendly staff, clean presentable restaurant and staff.

Tick list,"We pre booked our tickets and had directions on where to pick them up from however due to covid we were emailed them. This was great in the aspect we didnt have to find the collection office but not so great if you dont have the access to your emails etc.

Arrived early and found the south entrance which is closer to the metro line and museum. Steadier incline to the top with stunning views all round. Some slopes and steps so not wheelchair friendly and not great if you have walking difficulties. Not many hand rails. Due to covid one way system is in place. The views of the city from above is stunning and i didnt realise how big Athens is until i got up there and can be seen all the way round.",September 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Brillant service from the start,"Have used Nefis before for some
smaller trips and have really enjoyed them. This year we enquired about a day trip to Athens, sadly as there wasnt enough interest and people going the trip didnt go ahead. We also arranged to do their secret senses evening trip. This was beautiful! Picked up from your resort, we went to a winery where we had a tour and tasted some lovely wine before being taken to a perfume factory and being told how they make the different scents. We then walked to a hill to see the sun setting. We was taken to a typical greek taverna where we had a greek meze (lots of small dishes) and drinks under lemon groves and the stars! Greek live music was played and Nefis owner Jackie joined us for some greek dancing and singing. We was taken back to our resort.

Everything from booking here in the uk and getting 10% discount to going on the trips is so easily done. They arrange with you to take payment on or the day after your arrival at your hotel!",September 2019,Nefis Travel - Private Day Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g775851-d1911182-Reviews-Nefis_Travel_Private_Day_Tours-Tsilivi_Planos_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

Family friendly clean complex,"Everyone says its basic but what more do people want from a room you are going to shower and sleep in?

Welcomed with a smile and paid our room tax and for a safe. We were taken to our room, our door was a little sticky but we soon got used to this. Rooms cleaned daily and linen/towels changes regularly. Staff from cleaners, pool bar staff and handy man and mangement are willing to help you in any way they can. Rooms have a shower room, 2 ring cooker on kitcken side, plenty of cups, glasses, plates, bowls and cutlery. We only used a few of the items mostly a glass each. Kitchen area was kept clean, fridge and kettle too.

Beds were comfy and linen in good condition.

Pool and bar areas are kept clean, staff friendly. Tables cleaned quickly, food was off good value and full of flavour great for lunches and snacks which is all we had there. Pool is good size for the size of the complex and plenty of beds. When we first went nobody was reserving beds but towards the end people started doing so.
