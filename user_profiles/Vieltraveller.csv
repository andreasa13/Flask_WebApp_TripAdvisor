Very interesting (archeological) tour,"We had a archeologist as a guide. For me, it was a bit too much of that in the beginning as we didn't cover that much of Athens on the roughly 2 hours, but it was yet a very good introdution on my first day in Athens, hence a good start for more independent exploring the following days. Group size was ok, I think we were about 8 or 9.",December 2019,Athens Free Walking Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d3629217-Reviews-Athens_Free_Walking_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great one to one tour of Athens,"I had one guide just for myself. Eventhough my match didn't contact me at first, we made it work the last day of my stay.

Not a luxury hotel,"I stayed at this hotel because the Wyndahm Residence next door decided to be closed for repairs. The rooms are quite modern and spacious, but a lot of details weren't right. I had a dirty cloth from housekeeping and half used shampoo bottles instead of new ones in the bathroom and used coffee capsulses from the guests before in the coffee machine whilst somedays the trash didn't get emptied, asf. And there's a roughly 1-2 cm gap under the room door and the connecting door to the next room, I did hear everything happening outside in the hallway as well as in the next room. And the windows are really bad so it's noisy all night from the street and I could hear pedestrians talking even though i was on the 5th floor. With those windows the room also was usually very hot during the day and super cold at night. Breakfast was good with a cool view of the Acropolis, but I wish the tables and chairs were cleaned after people left, I always had to do that myself. Internet was fast and password protected. Staff was usually friendly and helpful but I just didn't feel like having to go down to reception more than daily becuase many things weren't right.",December 2019,Wyndham Grand Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d10961869-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
"Hotel was closed due to repairs, rooms were nevertheless sold","I booked this hotel just a few days before my arrival, but wasn't informed until my arrival that this hotel is actually currently closed due to repairs and I would be staying at the other Wyndham next door. The rooms would be same, according to an e-mail I received the same day, it would even be an upgrade.

Breakfast was average, no special options. My room also had a huge terrace but which was shared with the other rooms.

Nothing special,"The stay at this hotel was nothing special at all. We didn't get the two beds we booked and had confirmed, we only had one bath towel even after requesting a second, no shower gel, just nothing. And when we told them that we had to leave before breakfast, again no creative offer. Upon checking out they were only worried that we have paid, no other questions, no charm. Instead letting us wait outside the locked door not telling us that the other person waiting outside actually works there.

coffee shop in an old warehouse,Small place for coffee in Fritzroy.

Fancy serviced apartments in the CBD of Melbourne,"I had a very good deal on my stay and even got an upgrade to a two bedroom appartment. In general the place is very fancy, but some pieces in the kitchen were dirty or unusable (old knives, stains...) and the laundy machine wouldn't work initially, so it can sometimes be a bit of hassle to get things going. But the place itself is nice, there's even an indoor pool and a gym.",April 2019,Serviced Apartments Melbourne - Empire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255100-d15242646-Reviews-Serviced_Apartments_Melbourne_Empire-Melbourne_Victoria.html,"Melbourne, Australia",hotels,4.0,2.5
Exellent vegetarian friendly restaurant,Good and very interesting choice of meals. Also the staff was very friendly and helpful. It's best to go with friends as the idea is to get more than one plate and than share.

Great coffee,"A bit tucked away and all outside seating, but a good choice for a coffee (also take away) and a quick breakfast. Service was in my case very swift and friendly.

Great view for a great price,"Well, it is an Ibis and therefore a chain but I really enjoyed this room, very fancy with a hudge window facing the city and the river.

Very decent hostel with a strange vibe,"The YHA is a bit off the city where some hostels are located. The building is quite large with a patio and also roof top even with a pool and a great view. The rooms have AC and shared bathrooms which were quite clean. But the vibe was a bit strange to me, people didn't talk to each other at all, in the hallway, the terrasse or anywhere. That might not be the hostels' fault but didn't make me stay for long. Staff was actually very friendly and helpful.",April 2019,Brisbane City YHA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255068-d263399-Reviews-Brisbane_City_YHA-Brisbane_Brisbane_Region_Queensland.html,"Brisbane, Australia",hotels,3.0,4.0
Very friendly cafÃ© with a goodlooking menu,"I just stopped there for a drink, but they also have a good selection of sweet and savoury meals.

Good restaurant when staying at the hotel,"I had dinner twice there because of my stay at the hotel. The food was okay and vegetarian friendly upon request.
