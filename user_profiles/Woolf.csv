As normal !,"I often stay at Premier Inn, first time for this one in Bedford and it didn't disappoint, nice staff on reception to welcome you, the bed as normal was very comfortable. It was a covid stay so nice to see sanitiser etc in place. As for location right on the Priory Marina, nice to come out to see the water and hear the birds, yet so close to Bedford. OK so during these times i had to wear a mask in the corridors etc, well big deal...some have said Not for me at the moment....well i have asthma / heart issues and had no worries about wearing a mask in the corridors. Place was clean and tidy as i have found all premier Inns to be. Sorry about the next lock down, when you are open i shall return, many thanks",October 2020,Premier Inn Bedford (Priory Marina) Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190737-d570109-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Bedford_Priory_Marina_Hotel-Bedford_Bedfordshire_England.html,"Bedford, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
Great Location for Peak District,"Stayed for 2 nights (room 25). Overall a nice place to stay to gain access to such attractions as Chatsworth House, Buxton etc. Food at the Beef-eater next door great for breakfast and indeed dinner. Staff very pleasant at both hotel and restaurant. Room was a 'normal' Premier Inn experience, nice bed etc. My only dislikes of this particular Inn - TV is too small (most folks these days have large TV's when i was in my room trying to watch what must of been 20 inch TV wasn't for me, the courtyard area looked a bit dismissal (current exit to beefeater) exit several poorly looking geranium plants in pots - could do better ! and the view from my room had a flat roof next to it with a tatty filled 'shed', think i would of preferred room 26 on the other side. But look good service, good food, served a purpose of my trip.",October 2020,Premier Inn Chesterfield West hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2441114-d1486454-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Chesterfield_West_hotel-Eastmoor_Chesterfield_Derbyshire_England.html,"Eastmoor, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Overall Enjoyable,"Weather was awful but thats not their fault ! , some restrictions in place / areas not accessible due to Covid19. Must currently book on line to get a ticket to get in ( early October 2020). The house was very interesting all be it i found it 'odd' in certain areas / corridors to see such modern art, frankly i wasn't expecting that as i believed everything would be historical - perhaps in 100 years the modern stuff will be historical. The gardens despite the rain and low cloud are lovely, i suspect i missed the best autumn colours which i think will show them selves in a few weeks. You can walk for miles around the estate. If you want afternoon tea or a cocktail / champagne you need to book in advance, i went in as a single person to get a glass of champagne but as i hadn't booked couldn't get one. Nice gifts shops at the Stables. Christmas season looks interesting with some of the state rooms being opened / decorated, you never know i might book this up and make the trip again.",October 2020,Chatsworth House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g209968-d213894-Reviews-Chatsworth_House-Bakewell_Peak_District_National_Park_England.html,"Bakewell, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Lovely meal,"OK this place is open and should stay open. had lunch there today and the food and service was excellent. OK during these difficult times you have to have a mask on when entering or leaving your table but i guess thats the way of the world currently. I have to say at 59 years old (thats me not the pie !) the Steak / Ale pie was the best i have ever had, service fantastic. Covid friendly.

Excellent,"Lovely place, great food, nicely set up with settees etc in bar area. Went for lunch with a friend, didn't feel rushed etc so it lasted 5 hours !

Lovely Place,"OK the road up is a bit hairy depending on who is driving, but i trusted the driver. The views are fantastic. The monastery is worth visit, i am not a spiritual / religious person but there was something about that place when inside that just made me reflect a little. So if you are in that area and have a little spare time go and say hello to the monks who are most welcoming, given the fact this is only the second review i doubt it will ever be busy, indeed we had to ring the bell to get in, but welcoming they were.",October 2019,Iera Moni Metamorfoseos tou Sotiros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g644207-d15051939-Reviews-Iera_Moni_Metamorfoseos_tou_Sotiros-Kamena_Vourla_Phthiotis_Region_Central_Greec.html,"Kamena Vourla, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Excellent - worth a visit,"First of all Delphi is quite high up in the mountains - take a jacket !! - i didn't and arrived in the rain in shorts and T shirt. The museum is quite small but full of interesting artefacts, sadly the coffee shop was shut (maybe out of peak season) though the place was very busy. The gift shop can be walked around in under 30 seconds, its very small. You then walk down to the archaeological site to take in the views and monuments. Be aware that the paths are some what uneven and in places quite steep but you get to see some remarkable remains - take your time as you may walk past stones that were carved thousands of years ago.",October 2019,Delphi Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d199057-Reviews-Delphi_Archaeological_Museum-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A Must See...ummm,"OK sadly the Acropolis was partly covered in scaffolding which was a disappointment, and i had assumed as others had we would get driven to the top but you get dropped off and had to walk up a fairly steep hill and someone like myself wasn't able to do so. Did get to see it but not the views from the top. VERY busy place but hey i expected that, if you can go really early or late to beat the crowds then that would be better.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Worth a Visit,If you find you can visit this place well worth it. Costs just a few euros entrance fee and you get to watch a 3D film about the 300 Spartans and their battles. Has a small gift shop and cafe and you take to see a few monuments.,October 2019,Historical Information Center Thermopylon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g970269-d7258167-Reviews-Historical_Information_Center_Thermopylon-Lamia_Phthiotis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Lamia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0

Could be better,"Like all reviews do i start with the good the bad but there was no ugly :) so lets start with the good:-
1. Staff all very friendly and helpful
2. Entire Hotel very clean
3. Nice pool area and no scramble for beds (might of been time of year)
4. Food quality generally of a high standard
5. Good location to other bars and restaurants
6. Plenty of hot water on demand and pressure very good
7. Towels and toiletries of a good standard

Bad points (in my view only)
1. Location from Athens airport is 2+ hours (yes i knew that before i went)
2. Hairdryer in room - yikes you might as well stand outside your hair would dry quicker !
3. The beach - it is not sandy (wasn't expecting it to be) its not shingle or pebble its more like a dirty gravel beach. Did see 1 person in the sea all week
4. Cant eat outside (i was all inclusive and was advised if i paid i could eat outside!)
5. Restaurant lacked character and ambience it was like a 'canteen'
6. Some folks paid for sea view and got trees (my view was fine)
7. Evening entertainment most nights over the week was man and electric organ
8. Mini bar NOT even water included in All Inclusive package

Suggestions:-
1. Try to have even continental breakfast from outside bar area so folks can sit outside with breakfast
2. Change those absolutely useless hairdryers
3. Vary evening entertainment
4. Have some music in the restaurant
5. Include water / beer / wine in the all inclusive package for those on all inclusive

Overall - this maybe a 5* in Greek standards and yes is better than some i have stayed at but by world wide class this is a 3.5* establishment.",October 2019,Mitsis Galini Wellness Spa & Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g644207-d289574-Reviews-Mitsis_Galini_Wellness_Spa_Resort-Kamena_Vourla_Phthiotis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Kamena Vourla, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Nothing 5 star about this Hotel,"This is a conference hotel / business hotel, it does very little for people who wish to be tourists in the city. So I write this review as a tourist and cannot judge the conference facilities etc. First its location and the end of L1 metro - if you ask at reception where the metro station is they say 'across the road' , well frankly i and many other people needed a bit more information - go out of the hotel turn right across the road heading towards the hospital then bear left you will see a red metro sign over a staircase - this is the metro. (Which is fantastic by the way), metro will take you to all the tourist spots you might have to change lines and will be around 20 - 30 mins. One of my BIGGEST things about this hotel given its grading is that you have no tea / coffee making facilities in your room, it will cost you around €3.50 for coffee in reception area. No balconies or opening windows in any rooms. No facility to set an alarm as you dont have a clock. Swimming pool will cost you around €12. if you are a smoker (like me) then standing room only at the front of the hotel - no benches or other others though they do provide 4 ashtrays. TV channels in English only 2 both news channels - not that i go anywhere to watch TV but did find myself wanting to watch a film to kill a couple of hours - no chance here not even pay to view. They do put a card in the room to tell you about the electric curtains but nothing about internet log in - get this from reception area where there are signs. At 9.30pm the place is dead, any live musician will have packed up and frankly i found myself quite alone with 4 staff members at 9.40pm. The room windows are large but the sofa faces towards the room rather than the view perhaps thats because in most rooms you only see the motorway. Good points air con in the room was good, it was clean and for a 5* the bottles of wine start at €18. Had a dinner which you feel like you are eating in the reception area - steak, when it arrived well it was a nice steak with some onions / tomatoes NO vegetables or potatoes etc - i did ask the waiter were the vegetables were and he told me they were under the steak ! . On the room service menu in the room it states 'The great advantage of a hotel is that its a refuge from home life' - well frankly at home if i want a cup of coffee i go and make it - here you either have room service or go down to the reception area. So thats my review as a tourist not as someone going to a conference and by the way i used to organise conferences. So as a potential tourist again heading to Barcelona would i choose this hotel - no way.",July 2019,Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d630596-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Barcelona_Tower-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,2.0,4.0

Amazing Place,"If you come to Barcelona then this is one of the must see places. Its funny coming from the UK with our very old buildings that you think this was another one in a different city but its still under construction and maybe finished in 2026 though looking at what they want to do highly unlikely. But it is unique and amazing both inside and out. Tour guide very good pointing out the different features.

Great Food and Service,"First visit to Ben's in a party of 3 people. Really liked the atmosphere of the place, its not a stuffy place to wear a suit and tie, just a relaxed restaurant, nice staff and great service. Food choice was very good utilising local produce when ever possible. Wine list is also good with amongst others British wine. As restaurants go prices are fair and the quality is top notch.

Lovely beach,"Lucky with the February sunshine and warmth so i guess that certainly helped. Beach is lovely and is ideal for dogs (out of season so good until May). Its a great place for a picnic and building sandcastles. I see that some complaining about lack of amusement arcades / places to eat etc....ummm you need to go up the road to Yarmouth if you want rides, arcades etc, but if you want a lovely sandy beach to walk along then this is the place to go.

Birthday Dinner,"Excellent food, though portion size in some cases for the party of 13 people was too much, but the quality was very good.(we all had a starter and main course but not one of us had room for a sweet). Service was fantastic and all the food arrived in good time. Got very busy being a Saturday night but frankly that simply showed that it was / is a popular place for locals and visitors alike, but the service level remained high.

AUGUST Bank Holiday......,"Nice comfortable hotel which is a few minutes walk away from the sea, but its tucked away on a residential street which is ideal for a quiet stay. Plenty of parking and i was impressed that providing you notify reception you can leave your car there after check out and stroll in to town. Breakfast was lovely ~ plenty of choice. Rooms very nice and clean though i did find my pillows a bit hard (personal choice). Hot shower was great with plenty of pressure. I had no issues with TV reception (I didn't go to watch to TV but had it on as back ground noise and yes i could get all the channels) though those i was travelling with had a different room and had issues getting BBC1 ~ not a big deal.Staff at reception and at breakfast very pleasant and helpful.",August 2018,Virginia Court Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g609059-d584899-Reviews-Virginia_Court_Hotel-Cromer_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Cromer, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great Service,3 of us went to stay in 2 rooms. Both rooms very clean and up to Premier standards. My only very small issue with their rooms = no alarm clock and as phone had died didn't have a alarm.

Great Place,"Had 2 nights here as a solo traveller in room 2. The place is generally very peaceful but remember it is a working farm with just 5 cottages set in a court yard next to the main house / reception. The rooms are lovely and for a B&B the best i have ever seen - you get more toiletries than you can shake a stick at ! In the court yard you have nice wooden benches / tables to use. The breakfast menu is one of the best i have ever seen - and the food on both mornings was fantastic. I only had 2 minor issues 1. There is nothing you can sensible walk to - so if you want a bottle of wine (they supply glasses / cork screw) remember to take it with you, otherwise like me you have jump in your car to go and buy a bottle. 2. To the management please fill in the pot holes on the way up......my low profile tyres and alloy wheels are not designed for such things.

Great Place to Visit,"Went here in July 2017 as a solo traveller. It is full of history, beautiful setting and full of opportunities for a nice short or long walk. Its a World Heritage site run by the National Trust. Its a place for a couple of hours or all day. The water garden is stunning but the Abbey for me took centre stage - unbelievable that it began in 1132.

I hope the chef was not thinking i didn't like it. Peter who was behind the bar and serving me gave GREAT service, indeed as it was slightly quiet at that time we chatted about (of all things) San Diego and our past employment. The garden looked lovely and i bet it would be busy on a sunny day. The place is a mix blended beautifully of old and new, and i tell you if i was in this location again i would eat here for lunch and dinner every day (open 7 days a week).

I met up with a couple who were also struggling. It took me 4 hours to complete - thank you to those who asked if i needed any help as frankly my heart condition in retrospect would not have done this.

Breakfasts come in buffet form and i must say the quality of the food was excellent. I had dinner there on both nights and they do get quite busy so book your table at reception if you intend to eat there - again food was excellent. The hotel is located on a busy road junction but i heard no noise - not a lot to walk to from its location but most quests seem to use it for a base for exploring the area / attending family parties elsewhere etc. You are around 15 minutes from Monkey world / 10 minutes from Poole Quay / 15 minutes from Bournemouth.

I did two walks the 'red' route followed by the Coombe Heath walk. You come here for the walking and bird watching - frankly i am not a bird watcher but came for the walks through the woods, i could imagine in the spring / summer / autumn that the whole place changes by the season - wish i didn't live 4 hours drive away - as i would love to come back in each season - so i recommend at least 4 visits a year !",January 2017,RSPB Arne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2141897-d2140991-Reviews-RSPB_Arne-Arne_Dorset_England.html,"Arne, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5

EXCELLENT,Of my many travels it was a true pleasure to spend a night here (Room 4 (single) on 7/1/17) - my twin and her husband had room 5. Very clean - has a retro feel to the place which has been done in a great way. The staff were very good ~ helpful / friendly. We only had breakfast here after a wedding the previous day(elsewhere) but the food was top notch as was the service. If you need a overnight stay (or more) i give this place 10/10 - not often i say it but Perfect - well done ~ keep up the good work.,January 2017,The Coach House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2480020-d3250673-Reviews-The_Coach_House-Potton_Bedfordshire_England.html,"Potton, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Conferences and Holiday,Was at the hotel for around 5 weeks ! working plus a vacation during Thanksgiving. Must say the staff at the hotel were great - i have to give a special thank-you to Cricket and Florian who work on the management team - they looked after me extremely well. A shout goes out to Karen Davis - enjoyed our daily hugs and all the staff in Rum Runners and Harry's who looked after not only myself but all the people (nearly 400) that came here for science conferences. Hotel is a great 3 star - 3 pools / 2 hot tubs / 3 places to eat all of which offer great food - it does what it says on the tin - (maybe people from the UK will understand this !). Some work being done around the hotel during my stay which did get a bit annoying at times with the noise - but i guess every hotel has to do renovation work from time to time. Food in all outlets was great - they work hard to keep the place looking clean and nice. One thing that i believe this hotel and all hotels should look at is the turn down service - why on earth do you waste money / electric / time switching on both TVs all the lights - a pointless expensive service in my opinion when people might not be back to their rooms for many hours. (Think Green!). So i had a great vacation here in Florida - worked hard on conferences - conferences facilities were great for those looking to book.

Great Food.....but....,I had 40 guests who expected Rum Runners to be open at 11pm as it shouldn't shut until much later - but hey they had shut :( that said i did eat there a few times and the food was GREAT - service excellent - so worth a visit if you are in the area - a nice beach bar.,November 2016,Rum Runners Bar & Grille at Sirata Beach Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34606-d2421759-Reviews-Rum_Runners_Bar_Grille_at_Sirata_Beach_Resort-St_Pete_Beach_Florida.html,"St. Pete Beach, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Interesting,"The have the Dali collection and another exhibition - you can get audio guides which is very helpful giving you the history / meanings etc to the paintings, I thought the place would be bigger but only two rooms / cafe / gardens so i have marked it as very good rather than excellent.",December 2016,The Dali Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34607-d126833-Reviews-The_Dali_Museum-St_Petersburg_Florida.html,"St. Petersburg, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.5
BIG hotel,"I guess this is a typical Hilton hotel apart from its size - its huge. Thought that given the number of rooms that the lounge / bar facilities were quite small. The area outside if you walk around the hotel is a little run down but this is not the fault of the hotel but please do not expect great views over the city - you are a 10 minute ride from main down town. Very clean and tidy hotel. I was part of 300+ attending a forum and i know its difficult to manage such numbers but they did a great job of looking after us. From UK found it strange you could still smoke in the bar at night (designated areas) but for smokers a good point. I was on the 5th floor nice views over the river but only one lift shaft to get up to that floor then a walk which felt it went on and on. Breakfasts everything you could ask for and all great quality. Lovely staff who will look after you. For me personally too big and not close enough to the city center (Castle etc) - found other properties that had more character and charm though they may have less facilities than the Hilton, but if you like big and bold / clean and tidy = this is the hotel for you.",September 2016,Hilton Prague,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d276540-Reviews-Hilton_Prague-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,4.0,4.0
MUST DO !,If you are going to Prague you have to visit the Castle - OMG what a site - great if you love your history and photo opportunities - lovely place,September 2016,Prague Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d275235-Reviews-Prague_Castle-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",attractions,5.0,4.5
History !,"Hotel built in the 1950's for the dictator at the time who expected to have his office on the top floors - he died before completion. That said it is now a listed building FULL of art new-vow - marble stairs cases / light fittings etc. The fact that Loui Armstrong / Paul McCartney and so many other famous names have stayed here is testimate that this is a great historical hotel. My room lacked an iron - (executive room ) though standard room had ironing board / iron so not sure what was going on there. I only stayed there one night with the hope i would return next year to host conferences so i got the full tour of the hotel / facilities as i hope to bring around 300 people here. Hope the bar doesn't close at 10.50 when it should be open till mid night !!!
You are 3 stops on the tram or 25 minutes from the Castle - its one of the few hotels (dependent on room ) that might get a view - well worth it. All rooms very clean and tidy (from what i heard from then other quests). Breakfast lacked fried eggs but on the whole very good. In room fridge / mini bar pretty good prices for a city hotel. One or two down sides....ladies toilets off the lobby area locked (NO signage) so ladies using men's loos (was a surprise to me !) OK following morning / bar shutting early at 10.50pm and as a minor detail whilst i was waiting for the ladies to finish using mens toilets i though i would polish my shoes - that didn't work either. That said GREAT historical hotel - if you dont stay go for a drink / meal - i dont think there is another hotel like it.",September 2016,Hotel International Prague,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d277490-Reviews-Hotel_International_Prague-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,4.0,4.0

Conference Location,"What a lovely location in Malahide which i must say is a beautiful place - no 'kiss me quick' shops but individual shops and the coast line is beautiful. I went for 12 nights whilst holding some conferences at the hotel - conference facilitates excellent - my personal thanks to John for looking after us. The hotel staff are generally very friendly though in life there is always a grumpy one especially at breakfast. The hotel is like a maze, over the years they have added bits on so i found around 4 ways to get to my room - it was clean / large / all the facilities you need though i did find it odd they put bottled water out daily on your bedside cabinet which got rather warm as the rooms have everything except a small fridge - you get an iron and small ironing board (executive room area ) / hairdryer which has one of those annoying curly cords / shampoos etc / TV - PERFECT BEDS (a lot of people liked the mattress). I was disappointed by the lack of garden area - 3 wooden benches overlooking the main road / bay which is really the only outside area - the rest of the extensive outside area was car parking to 3 sides of the plot . That said i had around 120 people come along many of which stayed here and most of them were very positive about the hotel and its location and these people had traveled from all over the world. So if you want to have a lovely location - local to Dublin (around 15 minutes away) on the coast close to a beach - lovely town and people then go and stay or stop for a drink and meal - my recommendation 4.5 / 5.0",August 2016,Grand Hotel Malahide,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g211873-d212663-Reviews-Grand_Hotel_Malahide-Malahide_County_Dublin.html,"Malahide, Ireland",hotels,5.0,4.0
Depends on Expectations of a Castle !,I took 25 people up to the Castle for a tour - i must admit i had gone up on my own to see location / time to walk from town etc and i was personally disappointed at the size of the Castle compared to many castles i have been to - Windsor / Edinburgh and other Castles around the world in Spain / Austria etc.....that said i ended up with a spare tour ticket so went along with my group - and wow the history within this place is well worth a visit. I must say our tour guide (Dianne - sorry if i have spelt that incorrectly x wish i had more time to chat) was FANTASTIC full of knowledge and facts from this 12th Century Castle. The Castle set in around 250+ acres would be great for a day out with a picnic with children as a great set of kids playgrounds plus cricket being played etc.....so yes worth a visit - the 25 people i took up from the Grand Hotel loved it - i bet you will to.,August 2016,Malahide Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g211873-d216166-Reviews-Malahide_Castle-Malahide_County_Dublin.html,"Malahide, Ireland",attractions,4.0,4.5
Very Disapointing,When you think of a marina in most places in the world you think of a lovely mooring area for boats / yachts etc with maybe a few cafes / bars to drink in - not here i am afraid - i walked up the marina and it is mainly residential housing that seemed to end up in a car park along the walk - there is one restaurant which didn't appear to be open in the day time ....so unless you have a boat moored frankly was not worth the walk as no where to stop and take in the view.....and judging by the fact i felt like i was walking alone others felt the same !,August 2016,Malahide Marina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g211873-d7812659-Reviews-Malahide_Marina-Malahide_County_Dublin.html,"Malahide, Ireland",attractions,3.0,4.0
Peaceful,If you want a peaceful beach on a lovely day - with no horrible shops selling rubbish (buckets and spade shops i call them) then this is a place to come - no cafes / bars etc just beach and views,August 2016,Malahide Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g211873-d3679069-Reviews-Malahide_Beach-Malahide_County_Dublin.html,"Malahide, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5

Overall Very Good......,"Just returned from just over a 2 week stay using their conference facilities to hold 3 conferences. The hotel technically was out of season as the beach etc was just being set up for the May / June rush. Some of the areas could do with a lick of paint to bring them up to scratch but generally pool areas were spotless. Lovely staff who work as a lot of hotel people do tirelessly. The beach is lovely and at low tide you can walk around to the next beach etc. Sorry to say that the town for me was horrible - full of sports bars catering for tourists, found it hard locally to find Portugal !. A couple of things about my 2 bed / 2 bathroom apartment with kitchen / lounge / dining area - the hotel supplied a kettle but you do not get any coffee / tea which seemed rather odd for a 5 star and the other annoying thing (not for me as i have a European plugged iron) for some people they will charge you to hire an iron - again not 5 star standards. One of the people attending a conference wanted a green tea bag from the bar and they wanted to charge her €1.50 - again i find that not 5 star service but 5 star prices. But overall i mention a few negatives the rest was all positive, and i hope to return next year for another few weeks - though i shall remember to take a jar of coffee :)",April 2016,Grande Real Santa Eulália Resort & Hotel Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189112-d446903-Reviews-Grande_Real_Santa_Eulalia_Resort_Hotel_Spa-Albufeira_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Albufeira, Portugal",hotels,4.0,4.5

Simple But Clean,"OK for a budget hotel in the city - its clean relatively cheap and you get a continental breakfast. Staff who are very friendly and helpful. Its about a 20 minute walk to Old Town but for other attractions you are going to need a car or taxi. One review stated is was too close to so many strip clubs etc.....like most cities they have such things but there are only a few within a 10 minute walk. If you walk out of the hotel left or right you are a few minutes from shopping centers / super market. The only down side for me this hotel is more of a motel as portrade in the films - no pool etc etc - this is a basic put your head down and sleep sort of place, no frills - but tell you what judging by the cars there each morning it was full each day. I stayed for 3 nights - walk down to old town and crab the trolley bus and you can be anywhere in the city - stop off at Little Italy / Beach / Harbour. Do be aware that again like most cities they have homeless people which you will see in the middle of the road etc begging - was sad to see in such a beautiful city that seemed to have everything - including year round sunshine.",February 2016,Ramada by Wyndham San Diego Sea World Area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d141999-Reviews-Ramada_by_Wyndham_San_Diego_Sea_World_Area-San_Diego_California.html,"San Diego, California",hotels,4.0,3.5
Very Enjoyable,"Ate here two nights on the trot not that there wasn't anywhere else to eat but i enjoyed my first night there so went back the next and final night of my stay in the city.

You Have to Go !,What a great way to see the city and sights - hop on and off the trolley bus in the best areas of the city - you can tour all the major areas and get off when you reach one of the many stops - have a stroll around / do lunch / go to the beach / down to the harbor to see the Midway etc then catch another one to go to the next area. Your tour guides / drivers are full of facts and figures and indeed jokes and music to make the experience fun. If you didn't get off the whole round trip would take around 2.5 hours - but please get off to experience this wonderful city.,February 2016,Old Town Trolley Tours of San Diego,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60750-d208890-Reviews-Old_Town_Trolley_Tours_of_San_Diego-San_Diego_California.html,"San Diego, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
Have been to better,"I stayed at the hotel for 16 nights on a work related trip. We had up to 30 rooms housing a number of people attending conferences. Our business is going around the world organising conferences and this was our 115th so we have some experience ! This hotel is primarily used for conferences and people wanting to play golf - the conference facilities are indeed excellent, and the golf course looked top notch. The good points:- 1. You could get hot or cold drinks delivered to your door at breakfast time for free (2 drinks per person). 2. The hotel grounds are very well looked after 3. The staff were generally very helpful 4. Rooms are of a pretty good standard (see below) The bad points 1. When they have a large conference - they closed the adult pool at 3pm on at least two occasions with no notices from the lower entry points. 2. One of the only 4 star hotel rooms not to have a small fridge in that i have every been to. 3. Inconsistent room service - i ended up with no coffee for coffee maker but i did have 9 face flannels and 7 bath towels. General points 1. If you are a smoker expect not to find ash trays on outside tables and people moaning left right and center that someone is smoking. 2. Breakfast for 3 people (basic small cooked breakfast was over £80 ! 3. For anyone who thinks about saving energy - i found the turn down service a waste of money / time - they put the lights on / TV on and turn the corner of your bed down - the lights / TV could be on for hours - what is the point !.4. WiFi NOT included in the conference room so got stung for $1460 per day !. 5. Cost of any internal audio/ visual equipment required - hotel wanted $7000 we hired externally for $600 !. So would i come here on holiday = no, too expensive and potentially up to 800 people partying at large conferences, would i come here for another conference - 85% of me says 'no' partly due to one occurrence of a senior staff member trying to bully conference staff and the expensive nature of holding a conference here WiFi etc",February 2016,Omni La Costa Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32171-d76354-Reviews-Omni_La_Costa_Resort_Spa-Carlsbad_California.html,"Carlsbad, California",hotels,3.0,4.0
Great Food - very busy place,"Stayed next door at the hotel so had dinner and breakfast here. Had to book a table for dinner which surprised me being on the outskirts of Corby, but the hotel receptionist stated it gets very busy....wow she wasn't wrong the place was full. Ordered our meals and i must say the food was really really lovely, i had the lamb which was so lush, my other companions also loved their food. Breakfast - well given the fact the hotel was not full didnt expect so many people travelling here for a breakfast but yet again place was full, service was a bit slower due to how busy they were but i was in no rush but gave me time to people / staff watch.....seemed a little dis-organised with cups / mugs running out / people queuing for coffee but nothing to put it into / plates running out, juices none to have as empty etc but they were VERY busy - i can only assume loads of people go there because breakfast was fantastic - you might have to wait a bit longer for service but hey go with no time in mind and enjoy the food.",January 2016,Beefeater Oakley Hay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g227127-d2403727-Reviews-Beefeater_Oakley_Hay-Corby_Northamptonshire_England.html,"Corby, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great Value - Very Clean,"Only stayed for one night to go to a party in Corby. This hotel just on the outskirts of Corby in Oakley Hay which is a perfect location compared to some hotels in Corby which frankly is not one of the top ten destinations in the UK. This hotel gives you the option to get to the A14 quickly / visit Corby or Kettering. Hotel very clean, 24 hour reception with pleasant / helpful staff. Restaurant next door is top notch with regards to food - need to book your table for dinner. Can recommend the breakfast though VERY busy with people coming in from outside of the hotel.

Work and Pleasure,"Held conferences at this hotel which meant i had to stay for over 2 weeks as i was helping organise. The hotel and Castle are indeed fantastic, the town relatively small full of bars and places to eat, great on a Saturday or Sunday evening when the locals come to town, such friendly atmosphere. The food at the Parador was first class and well worth getting a table by the full size glass windows for a view towards the mountains. The staff work hard and most are very friendly. Each room is different so i cant recommend one V the other, i had room 209 and my companion had 208, both just off one of the main halls within the hotel, mine had the sitting room / balcony and twin bedded room - very nice, cleaned each day as you would expect to a high standard. Daniel who runs the hotel speaks pretty good english as do one or two of the staff if not improvise and you get the great service you would expect from any Parador hotel. Lovely walks around the town / castle, well worth the 3 euros to go into the castle and upwards for even better views. Pool nice area but water rather cold, but a place to sit and chill. Its 166 Kms from Madrid - takes around 1.5 hours by car.
