They were highly professional, very informed and had good communication skills.

I also do commend the drivers. Especially on the way to Delphi, there were some rather narrow and potentially dangerous bends to navigate. They were very careful.

A Must visit on this lifetime,"We have always wanted to visit Greece and see all the ancient sites.

We visited the Acropolis in September.

Wow, wow, it was worth the wait. I will strongly recommend that you go with a guide. It gives more meaning to everything. We went with Key Tours.

The climb to the Acropolis is quite tricky. Appropriate climbing shoes is required. Something with a good grip. *** The stones can be very slippery!

If visiting in summer, make sure your sun hat has a stap to hold it .It is very windy on the top!

Also, it is always crowded with tourists so you have to take extra care.

But once within the complex, its a magical experience!.

Kudos to the ancient Greeks for leaving this to future generations to see.

7 stars all the way,"We absolutely loved our stay at this hotel.

Location: The hotel is located very close to the airport on the beach front. The village is called Monolitos. Some noise from airplanes but not too bad.

The hotel is new and absolutely beautiful . There were a few facilities yet to be added when we visited, ( restaurant, swimming pool) inspite of this we enjoyed ourselves. When this place is completely finished, it will be sold out everytime. Trust me.

I personally prefer to stay here and visit all the tourist sites. Other villages especially Oia can be overcrowded!The hotel arranged pick up and drop off for all our tours

The Rooms: The rooms are so spacious . We booked a junior suite with sea view. Wow!wow! Thats for the views from outside. The inside has a living area , a small kitchenette with fridge (no cooking facilities, only to wash fruits, serve take away etc) and bedroom. The decor is tastefully done. We got a welcome bowl of fruits and some chocolates.

The rooms have plung pools . We used it once. Honeymooners will find this particularly romantic!

Food: The restaurant was not ready when we visited but breakfast is served at the dining area. It has a great variety, its fresh and delicious. The hotel gladly arranges dinner outside the premises. We were picked up and dropped back when we ate at Mario's ( A fantastic sea front restaurant)

Service: The service is 7stars. All the staff made us feel welcome and were ready to provide anything to make our stay even more comfortable. Vaya, Mr Antoniose and the entire team treated us like family.
There is prompt and free hotel pick up and drop off.

We even received parting gifts of delicious roasted pistachios and wine. Oh, those nuts were really good.

What more can i say.....than to recommend this place for your visit to Santorini.

And the price?... its a steal !",September 2019,Marvarit Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g644213-d17814968-Reviews-Marvarit_Suites-Monolithos_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Too far from main Tourist Sites,"I booked this hotel based its good ratings and the fact that it had a kitchenette.

The most important thing to note is that this hotel is on the Asia side, far away from the European side where most of the tourists sites are. It is so far that the tour company that we booked were going to charge us $400 for 2 days hotel pick up and drop off. Transportation only. We had to cancel

Apart from the far distant, i found other things disappointing about the hotel.

The Room: We booked a 1 bedroom apartment. It was very basic. Definitely not 4 or 5 star standard. The living room design is dated although it had a good view.I have stayed in several apartment hotels all over the world and this was the most scantily equipped with crockery.

The deal breaker for us was the TV that wasn't functioning well with ZERO English channels.

We called the front desk to send us a technician to check it up, they sent someone who could not speak a word in English! Of course, he couldn't do anything about the TV. To make matters worse, the Wifi was epileptic.

At this point, i had to go to the reception to request an early check out. I wasnt going to spend 1 extra night here.

Thankfully, they agreed to allow us check out the next day at no cost. I thank them for this. That is why i am giving them 2 points instead of 1 out of 5.

I have never done an early check out from a hotel before.

There was zero incentive for us to stay. We didn't enjoy our stay and therefore cannot recommend.

We moved the next day to another hotel which was heaven on earth and at the centre of the tourist sites.",September 2019,Fraser Place Antasya Istanbul,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293974-d9694737-Reviews-Fraser_Place_Antasya_Istanbul-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",hotels,2.0,5.0
7 stars all the way,"Only very few hotels have earned my 7 star rating. This is one of them.

Location: Trust me, the location of this hotel
is hard to beat. It is located at the heart of Istanbul tourist site, with villas sharing walls with the famous Hagia Sophia. On your right is the Topkapi Palace museum. The Blue Mosque is 5 minutes walk away.When coming, your taxi will be forced to drop you a little away from the hotel and you have to do the rest on foot . This is because, no vehicles are allowed within some distance of this 'protected area' . So, dress to walk. But this little discomfort is well worth it. Also, most tours start around the German Fountain area which is 7 minutes walk from your room. Very very convenient. There are several restaurants around the area.

Make sure that you try the roasted corn and chestnut. Very delicious.

Service: The service we experienced was warm, attentive, informative with the genuineness that they really wanted you as a guest. From the front desk to the concierge, to the restaurant , the excellent service levels is the same. Our friend Arda was fantastic, always happy to help.

Rooms: Oh, we loved our room at the Lavender house. EVERYTHING to make your stay comfortable was provided. They even put we ladies into special consideration for the toiletries (Wow!). The bed was very comfortable. We loved the ethnic design of the rooms.

Food: Breakfast was great with plenty of options but we really loved the garden restaurant. Enjoying a meal within the garden was like paradise!

Kristie from the company contacted us immediately the tour was booked with all the information we required including travel direction from Valletta to Gozo, then the tour was cancelled for the original date intended due to high winds and we had it on another day.

We took at taxi from our hotel to Cirkewwa Ferry Terminal. It was about 45 minutes from our hotel. We took the 2.15pm ferry. Its free to go to Gozo but you pay on your way back.

It was a great afternoon with Ben, our instructor, he was very professional, careful, patient and fun. We did a safety and demonstration exercise before hitting the waters.It was our 2nd time of kayaking and this was even much better. Oh, the caves, the blue waters and the general terrain was an absolute beauty. Ben gave us 1st hand information about the history of the caves as well as all the Hollywood movies shot around there. We had a small refreshing lunch of Watermelon and Granola bars ( i heard they were homemade by Kristie. Very delicious. Thanks).

The only snag was that we were the last group to get back and i barely had time to change before getting back on the bus taking us back to the FerryTerminal

Very huge place! I wont recommend going without a guide otherwise, you will be pulled to pieces by traders prospecting you for sales

There are so many things to buy here, Spices, Turkish delight, herbs, dried fruit teas,carpets, decorative pieces.... endless in fact.

One note of caution, you will be made to taste almost everything in sight, the sellers are lightening quick to pack stuff and add to your purchases, before you know it, you have raked up hundreds of USD/ Euros in bill. Don't let them hurry you, be firm and confirm prices and the quantity they pack for you.

While we loved the stuff we bought, we were surprised at our huge bill of over USD 500. It was when we got back to the hotel that we realized that they had made us buy SAFFRON unknowingly !! .....The most expensive spice in the world. So be careful.

However, the fruit teas are divine! We bought apple and blackberry.(dried and grounded fruits, not tea bags) Also the dried fruits and nuts. The shop that our guide took us to sells amazing Turkish delight.

Excellent day with Sercan,"Firstly, I will like to commend Guided Istanbul tours for their customer service.

I initially booked a 2 day tour of Istanbul, then we were told that we had to pay $400 for hotel transfers due to the fact that we were in a far hotel on the Asia side of town.

I requested a cancellation and refund and it was done promptly and courteously.

We then moved to a city center hotel and we booked the 1 day tour.

Our guide was Sercan. An excellent guy all round. He was punctual at the meeting point, met us with a smile and pronounced our names correctly ( a 1st in Istanbul. Lol)

We had a wonderful day with him. The guided tour was informative, at our own pace and with required humor. We skipped the lines and given VIP treatment at the sites!

We had a very good lunch together, (included in our tour) and anyone seeing us would have thought that we were just friends hanging out.

Our time at the bazaar was also great. Did i mention that he's a very good photographer too and knows all the spots for perfect pictures.
His deep knowledge of Istanbul and his passion for what he does is outstanding.

I strongly recommend this company for your Istanbul tours. Those audio narration does not compare with using a tour guide. It is worth every penny.

Excellent Stay,"I did a quick 2 night stop over in Dubai and wanted a hotel close to the Gold Souk and airport, i chose this hotel and i had no regrets.

Stunning architecture. My room was beautiful, facing the main street and the creek.

The Staff were excellent right from the doormen helping you in and assisting with taxis. My room was not ready when i arrived (i arrived quite early from the US) but by the time i had breakfast, it was done.

Breakfast on the 1st floor was very good with tons of options.

I had the hotel signature burger and it was fantastic, there is an Italian restaurant but i didn't try it out

One word of advise though, i asked for recommendation on Chinese restaurant and i was directed to a restaurant just within walking distance from the hotel, New Times Chinese Restaurant. Stay away from this place!!! Horrible food and even more horrible service

With the exception of the 'bad' restaurant recommendation, i rate this hotel very highly and will strongly recommend.

And for the price, its a steal!",October 2018,Al Bandar Rotana - Creek,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d12853782-Reviews-Al_Bandar_Rotana_Creek-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,5.0
Excellent Stay,"I thoroughly enjoyed my 1 week stay at this hotel. My room was huge, clean and had all that i required.

I LOVE the fact that the bathroom had big jars of Showel gel, shampoo not the tiny bottles in most hotels.

The staff were exceptional, right from the manager to the cleaners and you could see that they worked well as a team

I particularly loved and appreciated the shuttle that took me to my Culinary school everyday. Just notify the front desk ahead.

Wifi was good, TV was good. Laundry services was good.Breakfast was simple and ok.

No complaints at all and i strongly recommend.

Food Poisoning,"I bought some stuff here on the morning of 1st of September. By the 2nd day, we discovered that we had picked a bug as we were all going to the toilet. After a review of what we ate in the last 24 hours, we concluded that it was the Mr Biggs as that was the only consistent food eaten by the 3 of us that had the same issue.

Great Option in Ibadan,"I spent 2 nights here in early September. Hotel located in the quiet Iyaganku area of Ibadan.

Likes

- Staff are well trained, courteous and professional
-Rooms are of very good standard, same 3 star facilities like you will get internationally
-Beds were comfy and we had good night sleep

Dislikes
- None , i could think of

Room for Improvement
- Breakfast could be improved to offer more variety
-Wifi was quite poor! It would have affected my review adversely if i stayed more in the room and had work to do",September 2018,Best Western Plus Ibadan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g317071-d12699103-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_Ibadan-Ibadan_Oyo_State.html,"Ibadan, Nigeria",hotels,5.0,4.0
I liked the corn but not the ribs and marshed Potatoes,"We stopped over at the mall for a quick meal on our day tour of Abu Dhabi.

I ordered corn, marshed Potatoes and Ribs

The corn was sweet and juicy. The marshed Potatoes was poorly marshed,it had lumps and didn't taste nice.

So also the barbecue ribs. The meat was too soft and rather overcooked. It wasn't flavourful.

I don't think I'll visit again or recommend.",October 2018,Chili's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294013-d1062225-Reviews-Chili_s-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"Bad Food ,Terrible Service!","I asked my hotel for Chinese Restaurant recommendation and they directed me to this one. My hotel is Al Bandar Rotana and it's just 2 minutes walk to the place.

Absolutely terrible choice. The staff were so unwelcoming and did their job as if doing guests a favour .

The menu was limited and uninteresting. On an iPad.

The general service was so poor that I had to ask for plate to eat!

The food is arguably the worst Chinese food I've eaten. (Trust me, I've had Chinese food in several countries in at least 4 continent )

The portion was much for one person and I just ate what I could. They offered to pack the rest for me but I declined. It was that bad!!!

AED189 spent on a horrible meal experience???

Please stay away from this place!",October 2018,New Times Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d10094724-Reviews-New_Times_Restaurant-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,1.0,3.0
We loved it,"We stayed here for 3 nights in July and it was a wonderful experience.This is a converted Monastery several hundreds of years old and it is well preserved!

We drove from Pisa and arrived late in the evening, we were welcomed my Stefano who is a perfect host.

He attended to all our needs and settled us in.We had diner at a local restaurant just beside the hotel. It was fun to watch the England- Croatia Semi Finals!

The little village itself very fascinating. Very beautiful views from the hotel

Breakfast is simple but adequate. There is free parking very close to the hotel.

In all, it was a very satisfying stay! I strongly recommend this hotel",July 2018,Torre dei Serviti - Residenza d'Epoca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635636-d575014-Reviews-Torre_dei_Serviti_Residenza_d_Epoca-Casole_d_Elsa_Tuscany.html,"Casole d'Elsa, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
Ok for short stay,"Location is one of the strongest points of this Bed and Breakfast. It is within walking distance from The Leaning Tower (There isn't much more to do and see in Pisa?)

The host, Michaela,was very welcoming and professional.

Mind you, this is no luxury hotel, but modest adequate accommodation for a short stay in Pisa.

The rooms are large and ours was at the side of the building. Wifi worked, there was hot water in the bathroom and there was airconditioning. Breakfast is simple but adequate.

If i were to advise this hotel, i would tell them to invest money to bring the beddings to a higher standard. This will go a long way to improve the overall customer experience.",July 2018,B&B Villa Regina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187899-d12922242-Reviews-B_B_Villa_Regina-Pisa_Province_of_Pisa_Tuscany.html,"Pisa, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.5
