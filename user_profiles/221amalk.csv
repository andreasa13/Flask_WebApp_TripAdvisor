Wonderful Stay,"We came to Meeru to celebrate our 10th anniversary. The welcoming, the service, the location, the food, the smiles.... all was beyond our expectations.
It was a trip of a lifetime, we were sorry that we didn't have a few more days to enjoy the island.",December 2019,Meeru Island Resort And Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g4171801-d316973-Reviews-Meeru_Island_Resort_And_Spa-Meerufenfushi.html,Meerufenfushi,hotels,5.0,4.5
Quiet Elegance,"A burst of taste with every bite, and we sampled quite a bit. The Endive salad as well as the citrus salad were very refreshing, while the Butternut Sage soup was comforting and meditative. Had I not felt like a glutton, I would have ordered a second one. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the salmon was superb.

Good place to get lost,"You may know where you are heading, but you will soon find out that you have taken a turn and ended up somewhere completely different. This maze of shops, colors, sights and smells is simply amazing. The gold souq will lure you, but be sure to try and haggle for a better price, just as you would in the fabric shops. There is something for everyone at Mutrah. A great place to get all your souvenirs in one spot.",December 2018,Mutrah Souq,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294007-d502259-Reviews-Mutrah_Souq-Muscat_Governorate.html,"Muscat Governorate, Oman",attractions,5.0,4.0
Eat like a Sultan,"From outside, the place doesn't look that appealing, but as one steps inside, one is aware that a new culinary experience will be experienced.

The decor is inviting. The service is top notch. The food is authentic.
You start off the meal with a refreshing glass of frankincense water. This drink set the tone for the rest of the meal.
Among the choices on the menu, one can find seafood, for the pescatarian, a tasty Okra dish for the vegetarian and good old skewers (mishkaks), for those who enjoy chicken and beef.
The dessert and the coffee are a great way to end the meal, especially if one is lucky enough to get a seat on the balcony facing the water and the yachts.
A few steps away is the old souk, where one can walk off the feast while getting lost in the maze of shops.
If you are in Muscat, stop by for the unique experience.",November 2017,Bait Al Luban Omani Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1940497-d7841569-Reviews-Bait_Al_Luban_Omani_Restaurant-Muscat_Muscat_Governorate.html,"Muscat, Oman",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Savory, Sweets and Sunset","We sat on the couch facing the sea and ordered our drinks while waiting for the food to arrive. Our meals arrived, a Thai dish and an Italian pasta.

Yes it was pricey, but well worth the cost.",July 2018,Flisvos Sportclub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189431-d6706745-Reviews-Flisvos_Sportclub-Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Naxos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A Memorable Weekend,"We chose Al Haush to celebrate my father's birthday. It was a decision I will never regret. The serenity of the location, the attention the guests receive are thoughtful, right down to the minutest detail.
We enjoyed the the comfort of the rooms, the organic food right from the garden, the walking paths, the discreet nooks and sitting areas, the fresh pool. We slumbered on very comfortable beds and air conditioned rooms, then had a full breakfast on the terrace. If we got hungry before lunch or supper we helped ourselves to the apples and plums ripening on the fruit trees that provide shade for those lounging around the pool.
We spend two nights, but a guest may easily spend three or four nights, becoming one with nature, learning how to make various preserves on site, meditating or simply ... being.
What a lovely way to celebrate my father's 86th and enjoying the company of my siblings who live in various places around the world!

Lovely cruise,"The full day cruise gave us a chance to visit a few different islands and to soak in their uniqueness. Each ha its own charm, each had its own beauty.

A whole new world,"What a lovely day! We were picked up on time by our Captain, Fahed. He explained the trip before we left and one could see his passion for his job, his country and the environment.
Fahed took us 40 minutes off shore and helped us discover a world only visible through snorkeling goggles... but what a world! Fish of indescribable colors, giant, untouched corals where thousands of marine life can be found. Turquoise water and beautiful bays that mesmerize. Fahed made our trip even more special with his sense of humor and kindness. He had fruits, cookies, sandwiches and juices to keep us going in between dives.

Excellent Pizza,"The place is small. the tables are extremely close to one another. One is rubbing shoulders with other patrons, as one does in most of Paris' eating establishments. But that is okay, in fact that is part of the charm of Pizza Di Gio. There are only two servers, but the cooks are on an upper floor and a dumb waiter delivers the food to the dining area.
Di Gio is owned by M. Gio, an Italian accented man who serves a most remarkable thin crust pizza, salads and pasta.
In the 7 days we stayed in that part of Paris, we visited M. Gio's establishment 3 times, with the third being on our very last day before leaving Paris. At first I was very much focused on consuming my Pizza Classica.But as I realized that I had only a few bites left, I decided to close my eyes and focus on the medley taking place in my mouth; the crust, the pruscito, the mushrooms, the cheese.
All that went down perfectly with half a carafe of red wine that I shared with my husband. I refused to eat anything else for a while after that so as not to lose the taste of that last morsel of fresh mushrooms and unpretentious sauce.",April 2018,Pizza Di Gio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d4462696-Reviews-Pizza_Di_Gio-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A Beautiful Sight,"Burning incense greets you at the door of the Cathedral. As you walk in, you know you are walking into history and into a huge part of the French Culture.
One is compelled to light a candle and pray for loved ones, even if one is not Catholic or even Christian; the sense of well-being and spirituality reigns.
I kept looking up at the top of the Cathedral hoping to catch a glance of Quasimodo as he watches over Esmeralda.

A Must,"One cannot visit Paris without strolling down the Champs Elysées. That would be almost sacrilegious. Take the walk, stop and have a cup of Cappuccino and people watch, or just walk by the café trottoires and watch the people watchers.

Go Prepared,"It is a maze. One section leads you to another and you walk around knowing full well you have no idea how you got where you got. But at every corner there is something for the eye to admire and for the mind to digest.
Be prepared for lineups. Be prepared to spend a whole day. Be prepared to be share your personal space with an enthusiastic crowd who want to take selfies with every famous piece of art. Be prepared to wait for your turn to get a closer look at the Monna Lisa, and you get closer to the front, be prepared to be pushed aside by someone more zealous than yourself.

Great concept!,"Very unique set menu. A 10 course meal where each course is paired with a special local wine.
The restaurant itself seats only around 25 people and booking needs to be done well in advance.
The courses are very small, so there is no worry of feeling too full, but there is a big chance of becoming very tipsy. Good thing this restaurant is easily accessible by metro and trolley. because driving is NOT recommended.
The servers are very knowledgeable and can easily describe each course and each wine.
I personally loved the experience itself, but there were a couple of courses that I didn't enjoy at all; too salty, too fishy.
The place is very expensive; averages about 90 Euros per person.
Is it worth the money? I suppose the whole experience is worthwhile.",December 2017,Restaurante 100 Maneiras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d1572079-Reviews-Restaurante_100_Maneiras-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Fado and Fine food,"We were almost put off by the reviews, but we wanted to enjoy one more evening of Food and Fado in Lisbon. We are so glad we decided to go and try it for ourselves.

Great establishment in an old building with awesome details on the ceiling and and feel that is so Old Europe. Apparently this is one of the few buildings that survived the great Earthquake of 1755.

There were 5 Fado performers with unique voices. The show was pleasant and easy to listen to. The food just made the whole experience so much more special.

The place is located in a residential area. While we were there some neighborhood kids came in to use the washroom. It was nice that the restaurant allows them to do so, but in a tiny place such as this one, and with the kids going in and out, it took a bit away from the ambiance of the place.

Just alright,"I expected more, much more. It all started out with wanting to make a reservation for 8 people. We were told that there was a flat rate of 800 dollars, plus tax, plus 18% gratuities. I can't imagine that I would eat 100 dollars worth of food. We decided not to reserve and to just line up. Our bill for two people came to $90.00 but we had only ordered chips and salsa, empanadas and queso fundido. The pico de gallo was very bland, we had to add lime juice, salt and pepper to give it a bit of a zing. Why would they add cucumber to it is beyond me. The empanada was okay, but the Queso fundido was another disappointment. i have had Queso fundido many times in Guadalajara, and they never put potatoes in it. It seems that items like potatoes and cucumber in the dishes are being used as fillers. It is neither authentic nor tasty. We had a a total of 4 drinks and three appetizers, and that came to 90$. Our company had the platter for 4, and we had a taste. The meat was good. The maitre d'/ owner did treat us to shots of tequila and churros, which was very nice of him, but on the whole, I would try to find a place that is much more authentic, true to the Mexican cuisine and less about appearances. What's odd is that in their menu they state that they respectfully deny making substitutions or modifications in their dishes in order to keep the integrity of the dish, but they themselves have added potatoes and cucumbers to dishes that should not have them in the first place.",March 2017,Rostizado by Tres Carnales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154914-d7020863-Reviews-Rostizado_by_Tres_Carnales-Edmonton_Alberta.html,"Edmonton, Canada",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Yummy Lebanese Pizzas,"I live 80 minutes from Sunbake, but whenever I find myself in the North part of Edmonton i drop by.

Once a Year,"This was the place we went to for our very first date. My husband and I go every year, and every time we are glad we did. We certainly enjoy the service and the view as the restaurant rotates to showcase downtown Edmonton, but the food is always top notch. Quite often the menu changes seasonally which is a nice surprise. Coffee and dessert are always great.
I would suggest to book the couple's romance package. You get a room, sparkling wine and chocolate treats, dinner, and breakfast. A lovely way to celebrate a romantic event.",January 2016,La Ronde Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154914-d705927-Reviews-La_Ronde_Restaurant-Edmonton_Alberta.html,"Edmonton, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Awesome,"This was our second trip to the Grand Canyons. It didn't disappoint.

"Fun, Fun, Fun","The food is great, authentic lebanese cuisine with every bite. On weekends the place is full, so book ahead and expect to be entertained not only by the belly dancer and live music but also by the waiter, Charlie, I believe was his name.

Very helpful,"We booked the hotel in the afternoon and were miles away. By the time we check in it would have been 1 am. The person we talked to, Sam, was very helpful. The office is closed after 10, so we called him around 8 to explain our situation.

Momma's Kitchen in Vallarta,"We were welcomed right away and were seated in the cozy restaurant. I had been missing mom's Lebanese cooking. I have been in Mexico since August and by now I needed some home cooking. Mediterraneo hit the spot. The kibbee was moist, the baba ghannouj full of flavor, the fattoush was just tangy and zesty and the garlic paste to go with the shish tawouk was amazing.
Thank you Mario for a great meal.
