Hilton City München,Situated a 10 min walk from medieval wall and 50m walk to metro service means it’s a great location from which to explore wonderful München. 3 adults in room was a squeeze but manageable. Much to recommend it as facilities and room were spotless.,March 2020,Hilton Munich City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187309-d199638-Reviews-Hilton_Munich_City-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,"Munich, Germany",hotels,4.0,4.0
Great bier Keller that retains,"Great bier Keller that retains its Germanic vibe. As it’s a massive place, you just walk in and share any table. Food is very good for a canteen!. If there’s a queue we’ll just wait as the experience is worth it. My goulash was great and the Apple Strudel the very best we’ve had.

Contrasting Indian experience,"This Indian restaurant is centrally located in a well-off corner of Essex. Its slightly shabby decor could do with a facelift but should not detract potential customers. Its food is of the highest order and is recommended. In fact, I think it beats Shenfield Tandoori, my usual trusted restaurant. What pulls this place down is the awful customer service: the waiters just did not care. The wine (2 bottles) order was wrong -they opened red instead of white (doh!) and main courses came up haphazardly leaving one of our party of 4 waiting. The food dishes were just dumped on the table without any effort to place according to order. What a shame because the cooking was excellent. The poor service meant that us meek/mild/middle class customers did not pay the usual gratuity. Will they learn: probably not. Will I go back - yes for the food but will be under no illusions that my custom is welcome.",February 2020,Nirvana Indian Cuisine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g612466-d2278013-Reviews-Nirvana_Indian_Cuisine-Ingatestone_Borough_of_Brentwood_Essex_England.html,"Ingatestone, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Athens first time,"Little Kook was really cleverly decorated and worth a visit. It’s a kids place for adults. So far so good. Problems start if you just rock up looking for a table.The waitress was a witch, really . She couldn’t have been more unhelpful if she tried. Unless your party Number matches exactly the available tables/seats then you’re not getting in. Instead they will put you outside on a table on the kerbside, which is not what you want.
Go if you want but don’t make it a “must see” as the welcome can be gruesome/ghastly",October 2019,Little Kook,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d9710322-Reviews-Little_Kook-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
First time,"Plenty of parking within 10 mins of this High St restaurant. Excellent Thai food well presented and thoughtfully served. Range of beers and wine to suit easy going palates. So, what’s not to like? Price. At £35 pp for two courses plus two drinks and applied tip it was OTT. A similar curry meal in Brentwood is roughly half this price. Will I go back -certainly but not soon.",October 2019,Giggling Squid Brentwood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503773-d12458803-Reviews-Giggling_Squid_Brentwood-Brentwood_Borough_of_Brentwood_Essex_England.html,"Brentwood, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Acropolis -a world wonder,"It’s a wonder if the ancient world and is a “must see”. It’s not tourist friendly so need to be a bit agile and sure footed. If it rains, I reckon it could be a hazardous/slippery walk, so wear shoes with good grip/tread The route around the antiquities takes about 2hrs as there is a lot to see/read.

Pleasant surprise!,"Almost all reviews are negative on food and waiting but prsisw the views. The views are truly spectacular and well worth €7.5 each to take funicular railway up to top.30 minute timetable needs to be factored into planning.
We were prepared to haggle for a seat by restaurant window and agreed to walk away if we did not succeed. Eventually the taciturn waiter mellowed and we rearranged tables to achieve a mutually satisfactory outcome! It was a pity that we had to push them, when they could have offered a solution.
The food was 4/5 and better than previous reviews suggested.
Overall this place is worth the visit for the views alone. Prepare to haggle if you cannot pre book an edge seat (recommend early booking). Get there 30 mins before sunset and allow€60 pp for two courses and 2 drinks.",October 2019,Orizontes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d695940-Reviews-Orizontes-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,3.5
English elegance,"What a wonderful House. It surpasses hotels because Cliveden gathers you into an extended family. From the impeccable housekeeping to the extensive Parterre and NT woodlands, it provides a tranquil environment that drains away stress. We very much appreciated the comfort, homeliness and extensive facilities that our double aspect suite provided us. Dinner was to the high standard expected after pre-prandial aperitifs in the dark but fascinating main hall. Will we come again?

Ryanair challenge,"Bought tickets as it was lowest price for 4 adults even including paying £40/suitcase. No problem with flight but difficulty in adding a last minute bag. It was not me being thick but website not explaining that the service was oversubscribed so no extra bags could be bought.
If I go Ryanair again, I will be better informed about what to expect.

Austrian commuter,"Reliable airline who provide good quality and comfortable ride with sufficient leg room in Economy for a 1.82m passenger. As journey only lasts just over 2 hours, I would be happy for airline to stop serving snacks and just ensure we get a couple of glasses of water on journey.
Cost is comparable to other carriers for this journey.

summertime at the Boatyard,"This place has the wow factor. It's a great location on the estuary with great sea views. The boat layout is subtly done and works. The staff are extremely attentive and made our visit memorable. However, this is a restaurant and its primary objective is surely to deliver food to enjoy and make you want to come back. 1 out of 5 unfortunately. Starter was plain and boring: San Danielle ham on limp lettuce followed by Chicken Caesar Salad with lack lustre Iceberg and not Romaine lettuce. The chicken was overcooked too. What a shame! We will try once more as I am sure it deserves another chance.

Best restaurant for miles around,"I visit Macedonia 4 times a year and been to this restaurant many, many times because it is so good. Traditional food in traditional setting and great for people watching as the customers ebb and flow during the evening.
I do not care much for the loud music and garish TV screens also detract but these small points can be overlooked. I do wish they would serve točeno pivo instead of bottled beer.

Rochdale Canal exploration,"Firmly managed by owner Susan, this company provided an excellent canal boat for a Fathers & sons cruise on this splendid canal. We have been canal boating for many years and this boat was by far the best quality. We did suffer a mechanical failure (failed alternator) but Shire's immediate response was excellent and we were underway very quickly. Our cruise to Summit Lock through panoramic countryside was made easier by Susan's skillful and detailed advice before we set off. There are locks every 15 mins (well almost) so you need a minimum 4-man team (yes ""man"" as some lock gates are very big & heavy). This is a strenuous ""cruise"" but well worth the effort for the countryside and local pubs.",October 2017,Shire Cruisers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1009391-d2454551-Reviews-Shire_Cruisers-Sowerby_Bridge_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sowerby Bridge, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
