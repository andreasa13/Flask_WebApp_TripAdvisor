Every detail in place,"The inn was amazing. Rooms have kept the charm of the building but upgraded for all your modern needs. Spectacular huge bathtub, very comfortable beds and gorgeous balconies. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was superb. We also managed to get in for dinner and it was one of the best meals i've had in my life. Everything very vegetarian friendly. We stayed during the start of things opening up from COVID-19 and staff were committed to safety of everyone. Highly recommend.",July 2020,Naramata Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g499141-d8112407-Reviews-Naramata_Inn-Naramata_Okanagan_Valley_British_Columbia.html,"Naramata, Canada",hotels,5.0,4.5
