Old City walls and temple mount,Lines may be long but it's worth it to go to the top of Temple Mount to see the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa Mosque as well as the Western Wall. Access through the Dung Gate.,November 2019,Old City of Jerusalem,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293983-d318937-Reviews-Old_City_of_Jerusalem-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",attractions,5.0,5.0
new and well run hotel,"The facilities were very nice and the view from the upper levels is fabulous. Rooms are very nice, large, well air conditioned. Room service is great. Staff is friendly and very much customer oriented, respond quickly to requests and problems. The dining room meals were excellent. The hotel is located in a perfect place to explore the city including the City of David and the Old City. The roof top bar and restaurant had a spectacular pool setting and grand view of the area. Only one minor complaint: the lighting system in the rooms is complicated and hard to figure out.",November 2019,Orient Isrotel Exclusive Collection Jerusalem,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293983-d12188417-Reviews-Orient_Isrotel_Exclusive_Collection_Jerusalem-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",hotels,5.0,4.5
Beautiful building in spite of the wear and tear of time,"Be sure to visit the Parthenon Acropolis museum close by. It's a fabulous museum, well designed and curated plus an added bonus of an old Roman town discovered under the building that you can also walk through. November is a good time of year to visit.",November 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
long lines but worth it,doesn't take long but worth the short climb up and walk around the summit. The view from the top is an added plus as well as the nearby roman buildings you can see from the south side,November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
poor customer service,"The hotel is located conveniently for exploring the sights of Athens. However the service and management was below average. After we checked in, we discovered there was no stand for our suitcases so we requested one. Nothing. So we called the front desk and asked again. Nothing. We went to breakfast and afterwards were told we could not take a cup of coffee with us out of the restaurant. The tub/shower was very high and difficult to get in since there was no hand hold. The shower door wouldn't stay shut so the floor got wet. We asked for ice to our room and were charged for it. When we checked out, we asked for our bags to be delivered to the airport shuttle. They agreed but the bags were not picked up. We had to make special arrangements at the last minute. The general attitude toward guests was curt to the point of rudeness.",November 2019,Titania Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228891-Reviews-Titania_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,2.0,3.5
"over priced, mediocre management","Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in January, total of $850 including $8 per night parking. For $200 per night, we expected a superior place but it was not. We requested long in advance a top floor in a quiet location. At check in, they tried to give us a first floor and only offered a second floor as an alternative. Room was ok but a main light bulb in the kitchen was burned out and the bathroom fan didn't work. No luggage rack for suitcases. We had to tip a cleaning maid to find us two of them. Breakfast was poor: at the ""included breakfast"", no butter and they often ran out of coffee, the eggs were from a mix and were dried out and tasteless, etc, Have had better at a Super 8. BTW, it's on ""Museum Way"" but is 1.5 miles from museums.",January 2018,Residence Inn by Marriott Fort Worth Cultural District,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55857-d543350-Reviews-Residence_Inn_by_Marriott_Fort_Worth_Cultural_District-Fort_Worth_Texas.html,"Fort Worth, Texas",hotels,3.0,4.0

Well located and managed,The hotel was at a reasonable price and very conveniently located for visiting museums and Space Center. The staff were professional and the rooms well maintained and designed. Parking was very convenient to the rooms and breakfast was adequate.

fun family experience,We spent the day at the space center starting with the tour. It was well worth it to visit the original mission control and to see a Saturn V rocket up close and personal! The center itself was well laid out and interesting as were the several films available for viewing.

out of the way but worth the time,Lovely home donated by the Hogg family with beautiful art work and furniture and tours hosted by knowledgeable guides.

"quiet, clean, great service","We spent 2 days in Vancouver/Portland area. The Best Western was close to supermarkets, shopping, I-5 & access. Rooms were inexpensive, clean, quiet, well appointed. Assistant manager Anna dealt very firmly and well with a young profane guest who was disrupting our breakfast, making it clear this is a family place.

Ideal location and tremendous service,"Four of us were in units 59A & B. As mentioned in other reviews, the units could use some remodeling but we didn't mind since they were very clean and mostly well maintained. It had a great pool and very well landscaped and maintained grounds. The view was excellent of Tucson and Mt. Lemmon so that we had a spectacular view of the lunar eclipse right off our deck. We found the service and responsiveness of the staff to be exceptional and the location of the resort to be ideal for exploring Tucson and the surrounding area. There were hiking trails right out the door into the saguaro covered hills of the state and national parks. There was easy access to Old Tucson, the Desert Museum, and Saguaro National Park, as well as to downtown Tucson. There were plenty of restaurants and supermarkets nearby. We recommend it.",October 2015,Starr Pass Golf Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60950-d112505-Reviews-Starr_Pass_Golf_Suites-Tucson_Arizona.html,"Tucson, Arizona",hotels,4.0,4.0
over priced & poor service,"We would be willing to pay a premium price for good food and service but the Vista failed on all counts. It's a pretentious place: the prices were high for the average dishes served and the lead waiter was slow and very rude, not even trying to be civil. Better to go to the chinese restaurant Dragon Bay next door since it far exceeded the Vista in service and quality of food.",April 2015,The Vista,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g261654-d1599580-Reviews-The_Vista-Apollo_Bay_Victoria.html,"Apollo Bay, Australia",restaurants,2.0,3.5

penguin parade Phillip Island,"For 8 hrs. plus we were trapped in a van while Neil nattered on nonstop with what ever seemed to float in his head regarding everything we passed by including Aussie social mores, US politics, all scientific subjects, or whatever...expert on everything and barely takes a breath. Even in the koala visitor center he insisted on reading each display to us, presuming apparently any visitors to the area must be illiterate. Would not recommend.

Yellowstone Raft Company,"We were a family party of 8 who took a half day trip in the afternoon with YRC. Cory was our guide. The whole experience was fantastic for our guests who were visiting Yellowstone for the first time from the east coast. Their two teenagers had smiles a mile wide for the rest of the day and next. The trip starts off with a bang with good rapids hit shortly after the launch. It was thrilling and beautiful with lots of interesting scenery. Cory's stories were entertaining and he was intent on seeing we had a great time. Be prepared to get wet so leave cameras, belts, and other things behind or put them in the raft wet bag. Glasses should all be attached to you with croakies or similar. The get-in and get-out carrying the raft requires some agility as does the paddling so I wouldn't recommend it for those heavily overweight or with serious health issues, but the average Yellowstone area visitor shouldn't fear it and will treasure the experience. YRC has a photographer posted along the road who will take great shots of your trip.",July 2012,Yellowstone Raft Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45184-d2534944-Reviews-Yellowstone_Raft_Company-Gardiner_Montana.html,"Gardiner, Montana",attractions,5.0,5.0
