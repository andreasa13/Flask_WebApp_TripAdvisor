Incredible history and views,"Visiting the Acropolis to see the Parthenon was the main reason we wanted to travel to Athens, it did not disappoint the views were amazing.
We booked a 1.5 hour group tour with Get Your Guide which was a huge disappointment, the information delivered by our guide was muddled and rushed. It would have been better to read from our guidebook as we saw the sights on the way to the top.
We visited Athens in March, the weather was great but more importantly the volume of people was much more manageable to see the sights without huge crowds.
The Acropolis was one of the highlights of our holiday to Athens but maybe think about exploring yourself or with a private guide.",March 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Average food, poor service","When we arrived at the restaurant for dinner it was very quiet, it had no atmosphere. The food was average but the service was terrible.

Stylish hotel and great location,"This hotel had stylish decor and the rooms were very modern and clean. However the air con was insufficient and when we questioned the staff about changing the temperature we were told the air con could not be changed even though this was not the case in my sisters room.

Fantastic personalised walking tour of Athens,"We booked this tour as we wanted an in-depth tour about Greek mythology. Our tour guide Ioannis was very informative, funny and approachable. Our tour was tailored to our interests and requests. It was great to have a one-on-one tour around the historic city. Ioannis also gave us restaurant recommendations as we walked round the different districts.
This was a great way to explore Athens and was the best tour we did on our holiday.

"Amazing trip to Delphi from Athens, not to be missed!","We booked last minute onto this tour and was not disappointed. Our driver was Billy, he drove and gave us all the information we would need at Delphi and for the museum as he was not allowed to accompany us in these places. This worked out well as we had our information and could take our time seeing the sights and taking photos as we pleased.
We stopped for lunch in Arachova on the way back to Athens which was a good photo opportunity.
Delphi was an incredible day trip and not to be missed when visiting Athens. Billy made the day easy and stress free and I would highly recommend if you are thinking about visiting Delphi for a day.

Terrible service,"I visited Juju’s for the second time yesterday and want to express how unsatisfactory the service was both today and on my previous visit.

The first time we visited your staff were rude and uninterested but we put this down to a one off so tried again today but had a similar experience.

Today when we entered we stood and waited for about ten minutes with no staff acknowledging us, even though they were constantly walking past and were blatantly avoiding eye contact with us. We were then told it would be a five to ten minute wait, even though there were 3 tables that had been empty since our arrival and had not been cleared. We then waited well over 20 minutes to be seated and once seated had to wait further 20 minutes with no greeting or drinks order. I then went up to the bar to ask to be served and finally someone came over. We then waited 25 minutes for the food, which is fine, but the drinks arrived after the food.

We just had the feeling during the whole visit that we were an inconvenience and felt uncomfortable. Which is surprising as your reviews are so good, but this is the second bad experience we have had there.",January 2020,Ju Ju's Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186402-d2361040-Reviews-Ju_Ju_s_Cafe-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.5

"Rude staff, wouldnt reccomend","On arrival we were greeted with ‘you didn’t tell us you were checking in a day later’. After our flight was cancelled 5 days before our trip due to transport strikes in Italy, through expedia we had informed the hotel we were coming a day later due to the flight change. We had written email confirmation of this change. But the hotel reception staff told us initially that they had given the room away (despite us still paying for the two nights) and we were ‘lucky to still get a room’ as someone else hadnt arrived. Luckily we had the email trail on our phone to prove that we had in fact contacted the hotel, despite them trying to blame us for their error. It was poor customer service and unprofessional.
The location of the hotel was perfect for walking to tourist sights and the room was clean. However our room was tired and shabby, the air con didnt work and was noisy when we had the window open as the hotel was close to the university.
We would not come back here and we would not recommend to friends and family.",June 2018,Royal Victoria Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187899-d236025-Reviews-Royal_Victoria_Hotel-Pisa_Province_of_Pisa_Tuscany.html,"Pisa, Italy",hotels,2.0,3.5
