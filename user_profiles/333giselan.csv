Beautiful collection inside and staff and very informative.

Scenic view surrounded by ginormous monuments,"It’s a must visit if you are in Athens. It was not in our plans initially but it was worth the 20€ we pay at entry per person.
You step into a another world. Impressive and ginormous. So many temples together in same place with beautiful scenic views from the new and old city.
Although did not allow access to Dyonisios Theatre it gave us a beautiful view from the top/back of it.
Take good grippy shoes and sun protection if you go in Summer. People with poor mobility might struggle there due to the amount of steps and uneven floor.
They don’t allow food to go in. There is fountain with drinkable water inside and toilets as well.",September 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Amazing infinity pool with fantastic view,"I booked 2 nights as we wanted to fishing our 2 weeks in Kerala feeling relaxed. This was my best decision. The hotel is very pretty, the view from the infinity pool is amazing with hot water in chilly sunset. The breakfast had a good selection of Indian and European food.
