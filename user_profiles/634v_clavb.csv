Hidden treasure,"We came across this venue during random walk across the city a loved it on the first sight.

The building itself is the main issue what makes this joint special. They serve great white wine and local craft beers as well as cuisine. It is also near the old city so you can come here and don’t lose time wandering too far from the main historical center.

And between 2pm to 6 pm they hold happy hour buy one-get one free for wine glass and craft beer so you have the great opportunity to get drunk faster and cheaper :)",December 2018,The Hill Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298082-d8783352-Reviews-The_Hill_Station-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html,"Hoi An, Vietnam",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Beautiful, breathtaking, colorful","We traveled to Hoi An from Hue and in the very first moment when we entered the old city we were amazed.

Thousands of lampions in all possible colors and shapes, the river flooded with floating candles and small ships, small food stalls and restaurants, shoemakers and tailor workshops. All of this make this place unforgettable.

Apart from that the city forbids the enterance of motorbikes so it is finally calm amd with no honking all around. We loved it here, bought a tailor-made shoes, wallets and handbag.",December 2018,Hoi An Ancient Town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298082-d4507121-Reviews-Hoi_An_Ancient_Town-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html,"Hoi An, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,4.5

Nice but only when pasing by,"We drove past this park and decided to stop for a short walk. And thats it. Its nice park but only a park.

In center there is this huge round platform with no explanatoon what its for and a few small shrines. And a pigeon house. And then you can go.",December 2018,Dan Nam Giao,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293926-d6224444-Reviews-Dan_Nam_Giao-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html,"Hue, Vietnam",attractions,3.0,3.5
Awesome hotel,"This is the right place to stay in when visiting Hue. It has great location, nice rooms and modern design.

The staff here is the most precios gem though. They did just everything for us as we asked. Managed the motorbike, booked tickets for our next journey and helped us with tour around Hue.

Up to that it has the richest breakfast and they just can’t stop asking you to order more and more food! And it costs no extra money!

Go for it, really.",December 2018,Hue Serene Shining Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293926-d8755459-Reviews-Hue_Serene_Shining_Hotel_Spa-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html,"Hue, Vietnam",hotels,5.0,5.0
Pure Vietnam spirit,"We love to really breathe in the pure local atmosphere. And here it is.

Dirty, smelly and loud market situated in huge building and adjacent street is crowded by stand with everything you can imagine and even more.

Motorbikes rides the place as well as rikshas, bikes and pedestrians. You can taste various meals from sweet beans in some jelly to dried fish and seafood. We loved it here even after the was necesary.",December 2018,Dong Ba Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293926-d2519037-Reviews-Dong_Ba_Market-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html,"Hue, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,3.5
Hue urbex,"As a huge urbexer it was mandatory to visit this place. We drove from Hue and ended up on the top of a bridge where the dead park begins.

On this side there is a huge tribune facing the lake with cetral pool. It has some plumbing so it used to make some water show I guess. From the top of the tribune you can see the rest of the huge park but when we wanted to go further we were stopped by a police officer. Very sad ending for this urbex as there are no gates and no forbidding signs in the area.",December 2018,Abandoned Water Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293926-d15632400-Reviews-Abandoned_Water_Park-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html,"Hue, Vietnam",attractions,3.0,4.0
Unique architecture,"This place was recommended by our hotel manager so we took a motorbike a went there.

The tomb is a combination of european and asian styles and it really is a great fusion. You can find awesome details such as jade eyes of the dragons and many statues outside.

The ticket costs 100.000 Dongs which we found very convenient. The inerior of the tomb is magnificent. The whole place is decorated with colorful mosaic and golden idols.

Only thing was that this place was bus-crowded with tourists so it was hard to take nice pictures without people other taking picrures.",December 2018,Imperial Tomb of Dong Khanh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293926-d8546743-Reviews-Imperial_Tomb_of_Dong_Khanh-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html,"Hue, Vietnam",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice history touch,"The citadel is a must when in Hue so we went there as well.

The whole complex is very nice and during our visit there were some reconstructions ongoing so they are still making this place better.

The area is very huge so you can easily lost track of time so be careful how many pictures you will take. There are at total ten gates but only one is the entry one. The ticket costs 150.00 Dongs and then you can wander around as you like. Many explanatory history photos are placed in the buildings so you can learn the purpose of halls and pavilions.

We were also lucky to hear traditional musical band playing outside which was very nice.",December 2018,Hue Royal Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293926-d451120-Reviews-Hue_Royal_Palace-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html,"Hue, Vietnam",attractions,4.0,4.0
Must see,"We’ve chosen to visit after one friends recommendation and changed our plans a little bit. And all regrets were of table when the boat entered this cave which is the biggest river cave in the world.

First of all, the signage in the Phong Nha city is aweful. DON’T follow your gps as it will take you directly to the cave but to the opposite side of the river from where the entrance is forbidden. The only way to enter is via ticket office by booking a boat. When you travel alone or in a couple you will be forced to buy a whole boat for 360K of Dongs (15$) and then you need to hunt down more people to share it. Nice game btw. Up to that the ticket is 150K of Dongs (6$) per person.

After approx 30 mins of boat row you will enter the Unesco heritage cave, the rower will remove the roof of the boat and the wonder begins.

The cave was a main base during Vietnamese war and served as a storage hall and hospital. But the looks are unforgattable. You feel so small and unsignificant under the preassure of majestic rock structures that I forgot to take photos in one moment. And when I woke up I almost missed the boat back BECAUSE taking the photos.",December 2018,Phong Nha Caves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g4014591-d321298-Reviews-Phong_Nha_Caves-Phong_Nha_Ke_Bang_National_Park_Quang_Binh_Province.html,"Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Vietnam",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Geminai is a gem, trully","Next stop on our way to the south of Vietnam and we don’t regret a thing.

The hotel room war regular as we are used to boom BUT the main issue here is the cuisine. Exquisite tastes from both local and world traditions. One of the best spaghetti bolognese and also Tom Yum soup. AND they serve local rhum as well!

Also the staff is very helpfull but the english is a bit one-man-show here. He helped us with planning the sightseeing, rented us a motorcycle and also booked a trait ticket to continue our adventure. Hope to meet more nice people like here!",December 2018,GEMINAI Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g659924-d10317611-Reviews-GEMINAI_Restaurant-Dong_Hoi_Quang_Binh_Province.html,"Dong Hoi, Vietnam",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Like a dream,"We were traveling from Ha Long bay to Ninh Binh by a sleeping bus that our taxi driver stopped on the street so we had no clue where it stops. During our way we booked a room in Le Lodge hotel.

And then it started. Jessie, the hotel manager helped us during our way by contacting the bus company herself based on data she got from single photo (!) of a bus and let us know almost immediately where and when to get off the bus. She also wrote us the price of a taxi to her hotel so we weren’t robbed.

After we arrived Jessie get us a map with all the major landmarks and recommended the ideal tour. We got beautiful huge room with balcony and nicely supplied minibar.

Jessie also managed to do our laundry, rented us a motorbike for a whole day and if wasn’t enough she booked a train tickets that were waiting for us on the reception before we left.
