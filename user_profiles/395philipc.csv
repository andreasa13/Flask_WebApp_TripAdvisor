Great site if Olympic sport interests you,"The site gives you a good impression of the first modern Olympic Games. Do not expect a lot of detail. The remarkable part is that it is so much different from current day Olympics. Keep in mind it is the place where it all started again. If that is your interest, come and see it yourself.",July 2020,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Prime attraction for Greek culture,"Just the place to go if you would like the feel of old Greek culture. If you go, consider late afternoon or evening. In summer it is open till 20h00. The light is best in the evening for photos and the temperature is more moderate.",July 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Just excellent Greek food,"An excellent Greek restaurant for those who are looking for traditional Greek food. We do not give quickly a five star rating but because the food is excellent and service was nice it is well deserved. This is not a Michelin star restaurant but it deserves the rating due to the price quality. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the food.",July 2020,Kalamaki Kolonaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3324168-Reviews-Kalamaki_Kolonaki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Healthy food, excellent coffee and tart","For those who like slow food. Nice setting, excellent bread with different organic combinations, a wide variety of coffees and tart. Ideal for breakfast, lunch or an afternoon break. A little more expensive than average but compensated by the quality. Definitely worthwhile.",May 2018,Le Pain Quotitien,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186605-d14080073-Reviews-Le_Pain_Quotitien-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",restaurants,5.0,3.0
Excellent Pizza on a beautiful place - worthwhile,Excellent pizzas. These are clearly better than average. This explains the four star rating together with the nice setting. The pana cotta is also lovely. Service is average but correct. This restaurant is worth the visit if you are in Montefalco. Enjoy it!,August 2017,Federico II,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608939-d2373011-Reviews-Federico_II-Montefalco_Province_of_Perugia_Umbria.html,"Montefalco, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Average food but located on a nice place,The restaurant is well located and has a variety of choices on the menu including some pizzas (but limited to four choices). We went with our children who enjoyed their pizza and which was of good quality even though it is not a typical pizzeria. The pasta is of good quality. However the tagliata (steak) was not very tender and was a bit disappointing. Service was correct but not exceptional. There was a Servant speaking very good English which is helpful. Overall correct Italian food but not exceptional. Go here for the nice location and to have correct food. Pricing is average.,August 2017,Ottavius Hosteria D'Autore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g262048-d1898610-Reviews-Ottavius_Hosteria_D_Autore-Bevagna_Province_of_Perugia_Umbria.html,"Bevagna, Italy",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Excellent place to relax with the family,"You will be residing in an ancient castello with a unique view over Gradara and its environment. Each room has a unique theme. There is a nice swimming pool, however not extremely big (not ideal if you would like to go for a real swim). There are original accents such as a bed attached to a tree making it float mid air, water bucket, etc Staff is very helpful. An ideal place to pass time with children and visit the region. Even for bigger groups, this is perfect as several rooms can be rented each with its privacy and still plenty of open space and room to do group activities. Although there are minor improvements to the stay (e.g. Insufficient cupboards in the rooms), we still believe a five star rating is well deserved.",July 2017,Castello di Granarola,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g4758270-d4703333-Reviews-Castello_di_Granarola-Granarola_Province_of_Pesaro_and_Urbino_Marche.html,"Granarola, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
Nice setting to eat Italian,"The restaurant is well located and has a nice terrace in a quite street. Ideal to enjoy when visiting the city. This is one of the most important elements that distinguishes it from other restaurants. The food is good (but not exceptional) with some choice of eating dishes with truffle (for those who like this). The prices are a bit higher than you would commonly pay in the region (we were unable to compare with other restaurants in the center of Gubbio). This price is only to be defended due to location (and not the quality of the food). Service was correct (but again not exceptional). A rating 3 is well deserved. If either pricing, food quality or service would have been somewhat better a four rating was definitely possible.",July 2017,la Cantina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187906-d3514674-Reviews-La_Cantina-Gubbio_Province_of_Perugia_Umbria.html,"Gubbio, Italy",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Nice food at the sea side for family and friends,"This restaurant is at the sea side, which is an excellent location. This makes it also a good place to go to with children, who have the ability to play close by. The food is a bit more sophisticated than the common Italian cuisine. This explains higher prices which is justified by the quality of what you get. Worthwhile if looking for a somewhat nicer and a bit more expensive location.",July 2017,Le Vele,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635623-d1951149-Reviews-Le_Vele-Misano_Adriatico_Province_of_Rimini_Emilia_Romagna.html,"Misano Adriatico, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Excellent restaurant and nice environment,"This restaurant excels because not only the food is very good with a sufficient variety of choice, but also due to the very kind service. In addition, the environment is very pleasant. Staff speaks fluently English. It is true that the restaurant is focused on tourists, but the choice of food remains local with an extra touch. Wines are very good. Price is very reasonable. Definitely a full recommendation worth.",July 2016,Restaurante Ca Pepe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g736284-d2045131-Reviews-Restaurante_Ca_Pepe-Moraira_Costa_Blanca_Province_of_Alicante_Valencian_Country.html,"Moraira, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
