Impressive museum,"We did the Acropolis museum after the visit to Acropolis itself, and I think it's just the right order.
The museum is spacious, very lighted, nice to walk through.
The upper floor is model of Parthenon, with many reconstructed elements.
The other two floors contains remains from other Acropolis temples.
In the entrance floor there is a glass floor, and you can see the excavations through the glass.",November 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
