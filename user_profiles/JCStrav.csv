"Nice hotel, easy walk to TTU","Great hotel close to TTU. Clean, comfortable rooms, good hot breakfast available, friendly staff who made check in and out very easy. The gym had aerobic gear and dumbbells and a machine. I’d stay again!",March 2021,Hyatt Place Lubbock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g56208-d8632101-Reviews-Hyatt_Place_Lubbock-Lubbock_Texas.html,"Lubbock, Texas",hotels,5.0,4.5
Awesome rooms!,"Our family loves to try new Escape Rooms when on vacation- so we’ve done quite a few. This room was one of our favorites- clever puzzles, cool theme, and gracious hosts. We’re looking forward to going back and trying another room! We did the Shady Detective- got out right on the buzzer.",March 2021,Time Crunch Escapes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g56208-d20895213-Reviews-Time_Crunch_Escapes-Lubbock_Texas.html,"Lubbock, Texas",attractions,5.0,5.0
Family competition,"We did adults vs kids with two families and teen boys. The rooms were fun and staff was great! Puzzles were challenging but not that challenging. We’ve done many rooms- I’d recommend this for beginners to intermediate level. The only thing they could improve is that there’s no real theme, just a bunch of puzzles. We’ve been to other rooms where there is a better use of a storyline. Still a lot of fun and everyone left smiling. And of course the adults won :-)",May 2019,AdventureRooms Oslo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190479-d9563377-Reviews-AdventureRooms_Oslo-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html,"Oslo, Norway",attractions,4.0,5.0
Rick Steve audio guide a must,We bought skip the line tickets through Booking.com and it was really easy to get in. Then we had already downloaded the Rick Steve Europe app and all had our own headphones. The Acropolis listening tour is about 50 minutes and really makes it come alive. Highly recommend it!,April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Cool set up and great rooms,We went to Athens Clue South and had a lot of fun! We’ve been to over ten escape room places and this place is the coolest set up and the rooms have great props and were a lot of fun. We did two rooms on different nights- the price is better than most escape rooms. One room had an actor in it- that was a fun twist. Overall a great experience!,April 2019,Athens Clue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d5928536-Reviews-Athens_Clue-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Great birthday dinner - Mexican, my wife's choice!","The head waiter was very friendly and had good recommendations for us. My wife is gluten-free, so while we initially were going to stop at El Catrin, they have only flour tortillas and chips! This place has a much more gluten-free friendly menu. My wife had cheese enchiladas and really enjoyed them. I thought the chicken chipotle tacos were awesome! He said they might not be enough as no sides were included, but four tacos were plenty. They do have a slight kick to them. My boys had chicken fajitas and one portion would easily have fed two teenage boys - they were huge! My son liked them so much he wanted to go back the next night. Classic margaritas were very good.",April 2019,Amigos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g562630-d967921-Reviews-Amigos-Glyfada_Attica.html,"Glyfada, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great trips with Kostas to Delphi and Corinth,"After our rental car fell through (no international license - if not EU, make sure you have one!), we looked up private taxis and tours to Delphi, and this was highly recommended and the cheapest though comparable in price to others. My family of four (two boys, 15 an 12) booked the trip to Delphi. Kostas our driver was very respectful and kind, spoke excellent English, engaged the boys and us, and told many stories of both the ancient history as well as modern Greek family and economy and politics. Made the drive go by quickly and we learned a lot. Honestly, without Kostas, we would not have gotten a true Greek experience, understanding the Greek people. Two days after our Delphi tour, we went to Corinth with Kostas again - he had new stories, took us to a local seafood restaurant that tourists wouldn't be able to find, and we had a great time. Highly recommend it!",April 2019,George's Taxi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1905851-Reviews-George_s_Taxi-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Fantastic Father and Son Fresh Italian Food,"Luigi and his son Lucius did a great job, easily our best meal in a week of wonderful Italian food. The small restaurant is just across the street from historical Pompeii's amphitheater exit and we went at 4PM as it was one of only a few restaurants open. Two of the six of us require gluten free meals, and they ordered the gluten-free pasta with olives and capers - bright green olives, large capers, and a great sauce that made for a fabulous combination. My father-in-law had the pasta with clams that he raved about, and our sons had the angus burgers that came out in buns as big as their heads. Luigi came and talked to us and told us how he makes the food fresh and flavorful - and he had the pasta with olives and capers, too, so it must be good. My sons had the chocolate cake with melted chocolate on the inside and I had the tiramisu, which was amazing. They brought us a complimentary limoncello that was homemade and better than the store-bought stuff by far. With two bottles of wine, appetizers, and all that, the bill was only 120 Euros for a family of six - we'd pay more in the US and far more anywhere in Europe for a meal that good. Well done, Luigi and Lucius!",April 2017,Stuzzico by Lucius,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187786-d6171287-Reviews-Stuzzico_by_Lucius-Pompeii_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Pompeii, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
