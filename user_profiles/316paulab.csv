Amazing experience,"We spent 7 days in a over the water villa and thoroughly enjoyed it. We didn’t use the incredible facilities ( football pitch, tennis- badminton and volleyball courts, cricket nets, golf driving range, pitch and put,jet ski, Kayaks , scuba diving) because we wanted to snorkel and chill. We swam with sharks, turtles sting rays and many many coloured fish. The food was amazing and the staff sooo friendly ( particularly Quraish Abdulla our Waiter and Hussain our room attendant) Didn’t meet a member of staff that wasn’t simply amazing . The weather wasn’t as good as we expected - several cloudy/ Rainy days - but that cant be helped. The only negative for us was the All inclusive package. It was like going back 10 years were you could only have limited drinks and if you wanted to have a better quality wine or cocktail you had to pay the full price not just the difference. On a positive note the mini bar was all included. We had one night in the speciality restaurant ( included) and the food was stunning.
