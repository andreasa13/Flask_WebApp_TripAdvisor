Great fun .. great day out,"After the horrible hurricane that ripped through Kefalonia in September Dennis and his crew dusted themselves off and got right back to the job of delivering a fantastic day for everyone .. well worth the price just for the entertainment !!
Plenty of information given along the way .. beautiful stops for a swim ...and a delicious bbq with umbrellas for anyone who needs shade ... Great job guys ..keep up the good work",September 2020,Kefalonia Cruise Lady O,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g780715-d4885872-Reviews-Kefalonia_Cruise_Lady_O-Argostolion_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great for students or history buffs... not so much for me :),"Fabulous modern building... very impressive layout .. just for me it was too much for someone who is not interested in archeology on such a grand scale.
I would imagine for students or archeology buffs this would be an amazing experience... they could spend hours learning so much....
It's just 5 euros in the winter so worth it to have a quick look around.",March 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Got in just in time :),"Feeling so lucky to have been able to visit the Acropolis before it, and most of Athens was shut down..
It is a spectacular sight to see ... crowds were a minimum in mid March so no pre-booked tickets for us .. .just walked in.
I highly recommend the Rick Steves audio tour to give you a basic, light hearted and interesting background to what exactly you are looking at ... I am not a big history buff so didn't want too much information.
We went at 3 in the afternoon .. sunlight was perfect for photos .... Marble stones are very slippy so watch your step all around the area ...
1 hour was more than enough to walk around... it's not a very big area ...
A must visit on your next trip to Athens ..
As for the museum, we whipped around it very quickly .. it's just 5 euros in the winter... Fabulous building and display .. but too much for our interest ... if you are a student or interested in archeology, I imagine this would be like Disneyland for you... but for me it was not so captivating.",March 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Well worth the vists,"Very glad we made the effort to find this small shop in the middle of town .. very unassuming from the outside but the lovely smell once you get to the door is very inviting ... Simple place, simple food .. 4 generations have made this place a landmark in Chania ... friendly and information service .. absolutely delicious bougatsas ...
Thoroughly enjoyed our stop there ...",October 2019,Bougatsa Iordanis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d6639824-Reviews-Bougatsa_Iordanis-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Great introduction to greek food, service and entertainment","We spend a very enjoyable evening at Ta Xalkina in October.. still very busy in Chania at that time... we reserved a table outside to enjoy the mild weather, and were within eyeview and earshot of the brilliant music ... Service is outstanding ... waiters buzzing around the restaurant taking great care of everyone.... food was delicious and plentiful ... prices very reasonable .... lovely restaurant in a prime location, visited by both tourists and locals ... well worth a visit ... great experience and great atmosphere .. Bravo sas ...",October 2019,Ta Chalkina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d2500911-Reviews-Ta_Chalkina-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Excellent food and service,"Friendly welcome in this spacious and clean restaurant ... we didn't look around for any other place to eat so were delighted that the food and service was spot on ...
