"Very informative, but no audio guide",Take your time walking around and reading the information. But as I titled this I was disappointed that they offered no audio guide. Maybe there's something on the web.... but without such a guide unless your a history buff you'll zone out after 25%.,February 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Very impressive,"Very well worth a look. In my opinion this is the nicest and most impressive structure around the Acropolis.... and that's probably because you come across it from above and it is jaw-droppingly impressive. And clearly it was even more impressive when fully built 2,000+ years ago.",March 2020,Herod Atticus Odeon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242840-Reviews-Herod_Atticus_Odeon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Spend an hour or two here and you'll be delighted,"It's a bit of a walk to get to the Acropolis, but worthwhile. Watch your footing on the smooth marble - as that can be quite slippy. Be prepared that many of the structures are in ruins - it is 2,500 years old after all! My favourite was the view down to the Herod Atticus Odeon - an hemispherical amphitheater intended to accommodate 5,000 people. While the Parthenon is the main attraction, there's also the impressive Propylaia columned structure that you walk through to get up to the top, and another smaller structure, called the Erechthelon, that reasonably intact. It's also a great place to get views of the city.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Pricey, but a superb treat",Had pigeon for starter. That was a first for me. Tasty. Had venison for mains - not an overly generous amount of meat (Not that I'm a savage... but go for a steak if you want something big to sink your teeth into). Enjoyed a nice bottle of Chilean wine. Wife enjoyed her dinner too... but I just can't recollect what she had!! Seating & ambiance was good. Recommend for a romantic dinner.,January 2020,Reed Restaurant at Ferrycarrig Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2661135-d1935859-Reviews-Reed_Restaurant_at_Ferrycarrig_Hotel-Ferrycarrig_Wexford_County_Wexford.html,"Ferrycarrig, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Nice hotel, long corridors","Stayed for a pleasant weekend. Changed rooms several times. Once due to heating being way to high (& you can't adjust the radiators). Next due to faulty TV. Staff were very understanding & accommodating... buy I'd rather there had been no issues. Breakfast was good, with a lovely view of the river. We did the fine dinning on Sat evening- pricey, but a lovely experience. There's construction right outside the lobby, so parking was often a bit of a walk.... which isn't so much fun with bags.",January 2020,Ferrycarrig Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2661135-d212713-Reviews-Ferrycarrig_Hotel-Ferrycarrig_Wexford_County_Wexford.html,"Ferrycarrig, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.5
Well worth visiting and well worth the guided tour fee,"Definitely go see this. It's about a 25 min tram ride out of the city, eastwards. This was a prison block established by the Soviets right after WW2. The a few years later when the GDR government was formed, it became the main prison for the Stasi. You can only visit this place via a guided tour. For us it was in English, and lasted 90mins. You're brought through the lower (older) prison cell corridors (pretty rough!), up along more modern ones. Then we were brought along to see the interrogation ""interview"" rooms. A few thousand people were incarcerated here.",October 2019,Berlin-Hohenschonhausen Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d313983-Reviews-Berlin_Hohenschonhausen_Memorial-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good quality Vietnamese food,"3 of us ate there Wednesday evening. I thought it was a bit expensive. Restaurant was quiet... not much atmosphere. Perhaps that's Wednesdays! Food was good. We shared 2 starter, and had a main each. I can't remember what we each ate... but all 3 of us loved the food. And I think you could randomnly pick anything off the menu and it'd be good. Also, this was the only place I found had Diesel beer during this trip to Berlin - very nice beer!",October 2019,Ngon Restaurant Berlin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d12839094-Reviews-Ngon_Restaurant_Berlin-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Fantastic accomodation,"Stayed in a regular room (Deluxe studio). Fantastic. The king sized bed was super comfortable. Floor to ceiling windows (granted not a pleasant view - a disused site / car park!). Good bathroom - shower (no bath in this grade of room), with super hot water. Bathrobes & slippers!! Flatscreen TV with several English channels (though BBC didn't work - must be Brexit related!!). But the best thing was the fridge, kettle, microwave, and all the mini-kitchen equipment. This meant we could shop in the supermarket across the street and make our normal breakfasts!

Eerie atmosphere,"It's all about the building. I mean the shape of the corridors, the angles, the criss-crossing corridors, minimal signage - all intended to slightly disorient you. It's not meant to be pleasant nor easy to follow. It's not entertainment. The aim is to get you to experience discomfort as you think about what happened to the Jews in Germany leading up and during WW2. Worth visiting.. but not with young children.",October 2019,Jewish Museum Berlin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d190519-Reviews-Jewish_Museum_Berlin-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,4.0,4.0
Trendy restaurant with a good selection of healthy food,"Three of us went their Thursday evening around 8pm... quite busy. Splashed out and had the ""Dinner with Friends"" meal for €38... 2 of us had it with drink for €54 (I think). Had all sorts of delicious vegitables, shrimps, cous cous, enormous rib, fish,... and the beer kept coming & coming!

Very pleasant ambiance,"Get a seat by the big bay window and watch the world go around! Staff were very friendly, smiling and accommodating. My wife & I stopped off just to have an afternoon coffee/tea, but once we saw all the interesting things on the menu we expanded our plans! I had a delicious avocado beetroot-hummus eggs benedict thing. Not massively filling - but probably just as well as I had had a HUGE breakfast. Missus had some interesting chicken sandwich in a toasted bap with fries. Really savored our visit. We were the last to leave and got a gift of 2 scones on the way out!",October 2019,Hook & Ladder Sarsfield Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186621-d6825601-Reviews-Hook_Ladder_Sarsfield_Street-Limerick_County_Limerick.html,"Limerick, Ireland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
good value 3 course dinner for €22,"Good music from the 70s & 80s! 3 course dinner was €22 each... so you can't argue with that price. Caesar salad with prawns starter - excellent! Wife had a scampi starter with side salad - but I reckon that was actually prawns. I had a fish & chips for mains... okay, but wouldn't go for it again...just not a big fan of battered things (my mistake). Wife had chicken thing (can't remember name) - but nicer looking. Deserts - choc cheese cake (yum!), organic apple pie with custand & ice-cream (also yum!),",October 2019,McGettigan's Limerick,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186621-d6888951-Reviews-McGettigan_s_Limerick-Limerick_County_Limerick.html,"Limerick, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Comfortable double room. Nice visit,"Had a comfortable double room on 5th floor with view of the river. Double bed was a little narrower that I'm used to (so not a King-sized!), but comfortable mattress and pillows. Nice thing is the window could be opened and left on tilt... so fresh air! Bathroom was a little small.... bath itself was the shallowest and possibly shortest one I've even been in.... but not a problem, more an experience! Tea & coffee making facilities, iron and reasonable size flat screen TV in the room. Overall happy with the room for the price and 3 star level. Breakfast was fairly nice too - with a good selection of all the usual hot & cold buffet items. Staff were friendly.",October 2019,Limerick City Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186621-d239551-Reviews-Limerick_City_Hotel-Limerick_County_Limerick.html,"Limerick, Ireland",hotels,4.0,3.5
Magnificent gilted decorations and artwork,"What a feast for the eyes. Very nicely restored/maintained. A magnificent altar and backdrop, with a half-dome of gilt painted religious figures above. Very high ceiling. Several interesting side alters and shrines to various saints. Big organ at the back.

Depressingly good!!,Well worth the €5 admission. But hurry it's closing for good end of October (due to lack of funding). A volunteer guide gave 4 of us a tour. Spent 90 mins of so there. There's a classroom - where Frank when to school - and LOTS of memorabilia to look at & read. There's also a mock up of one of the places Frank lived in with his family.

Superb beach,"This is a very long beach.... close to 2 km long, We were there for 5 days in August. Sand was lovely and clean. Not too crowded (even for early August), but more than enough people to create a great atmosphere. You can rent deck chairs under umbrellas. It is a very gentle gradient beach... so there is quite a difference between high and low tide. Life-guards were there from 11am-7pm. Water sports activities available. But it's a great beach to just chill and relax on. The water in early August was a pleasant temperature. There were some jelly fish washed up occasionally.... but nothing dangerous.",August 2019,Plage de la Grande Conche,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g207350-d12707913-Reviews-Plage_de_la_Grande_Conche-Royan_Charente_Maritime_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Royan, France",attractions,5.0,4.0
nice clean and efficient ferry,We took ferry from Point de Grave to Royan. One way (car plus 2 people) was ~€35 or thereabouts. About a 30minute journey. No need to book in advance.

"Delightful hotel, excellent room, friendly staff","Had a double room on 3rd floor facing the sea. Comfortable room, lovely bed, great shower. Not a large room but the quality of the furnishings and the view made up for that. Small balcony - but one where we ate breakfast on most mornings. We paid for the buffet breakfast (which you can have brought up to your room). Room also had a small refrigerator - and we were able to borrow a kettle from reception. Reception staff were very friendly and made us feel very welcome.

3 enjoyable nights,"Clean modern rooms with comfortable beds. Note the rooms are small... and while there is no air conditioning, we could borrow a fan from reception.

Busy evening restaurant by the beach,Had a great priced set menu... ~€16 for 3 course (weekday evenings). Had a buffet salad as starter - great! A minced salmon with pasta main - okay.

Steak & burger restaurant,"Good selection of burger options and steaks. Set menu options are reasonable too. We were happy such that we went twice! It stays open till 11pm on Saturdays (which is hard to beat in this local area!). Don't go for ""bien cuite""... it's just way too dry / over-done.",August 2019,Restaurant La Boucherie Royan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g207350-d6617638-Reviews-Restaurant_La_Boucherie_Royan-Royan_Charente_Maritime_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Royan, France",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Enjoyable dinner,"Had a 3 course dinner. Very French, and very fish focused. Delicious! And very reasonably priced - €64 including a beer each and one large coffee. Oyster starter very nice. Mrs had a melon starter. Both had fish main courses. I had the ""chef propose""... polonte. Yum. Nice deserts. Got a table outside around 8:30pm w/o a reservation. Pleasant surroundings (Jazz band kicked off 9:30pm).

Amazing blues musicians,Stopped by there on a quiet Sunday evening and had a bite to eat. I had a burger - it was fine. My wife had fish & chips - looked good. There were 2 musicians playing blues and we caught the last 45 minutes of their set - amazing! The singer / guitar guy was on fire! It did however get fairly quiet after they wrapped up.

"A bit pricey, but a fabulous on a sunny afternoon","Spent at least 3 hours there on a sunny afternoon... and boy did the sunshine make it all seem wonderful! The gardens are awesome. You can take a shuttle bus to & from the car park to the gardens... or else walk it in 20 minutes alongside the lake. There's a cafe by the gardens - not particularly cheap - so you could consider bringing a picnic. Then again the whole visit is €14 per adult... so best to make a full day of it. We missed the tours of the big house (3 times a day) as we spent so long in the gardens (!)... but we went through the open rooms ourselves, and they are amazing. Luxury from the late 1800s. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.

Friendly hotel in the middle of Connemara scenery,"We had a large double room with bath/ensuite for 2 nights B&B. Room was spacious and as at the end of the building (room 100) it had windows on 2 sides. Bed comfort was okay, but was not unusually wide (probably standard Irish double bed size, nothing larger). TV in room. Tea & coffee making facilities. Bathroom - hot water took a minute or two to get hot (probably at end of pipe network). Room furnishings were a little on the basic side - not luxurious - but super clean throughout. Safe to say good ""3 star"" hotel level. Breakfasts were good - usual buffet arrangement. Breakfast area seemed a little small for the size of the hotel.... maybe some folk ate in the bar (by the turf fire and the ""Quiet Man""). You could ask for porridge and fancy coffees. Croissant were fantastic! Staff were very friendly and helpful. I don't think there was a lift (at least we never came across it!). Overall I'd be more than happy to stay again.",June 2019,Peacockes Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g551535-d213225-Reviews-Peacockes_Hotel-Maam_Cross_County_Galway_Western_Ireland.html,"Maam Cross, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great Saturday night dinner spot,"Enjoyed dinner for 2! I had the ""tower burger"" - very Nice, filling. Wife had the Irish Stew - tasty, too much for her to finish so I helped! Apple crumble, custard & ice cream for desert - a bit ""watery""... but thoroughly tasty. A young musician started playing at 10pm - very pleasant, glad it wasn't the diddly-die stuff.

Great spot for Sunday lunch,It was a fab sunny day... so that put us in a great mood. We stopped there for lunch and were really impressed with quality of the lunch. I had the roast striploin of beef with all the trimmings plus horse-radish sauce. And followed that with a nice big slice of a light cheese cake thing. My wife only ordered one dish for herself (can't remember what it was!) but she really liked it.

"Delightful hotel, excellent room, friendly staff","My wife & I stayed for 2 nights in an Executive room. From the moment we arrived the concierge was very helpful and friendly - helped with the parking arrangements and with bringing the suitcases up to the room. The room has 2 beds - one reasonbale sized double (not king size) and one large single. Excellent things: quality of the room, fittings, trim, TV, wardrobe with safe, Nespresso coffee maker, bottle of wine, 2 chocolates and paper rose petals on the bed, bath had jacuzzi, double sink. The only draw back of the room was no window (for view, and to open for fresh air). There was a window, but it looked into an artifical micro courtyard. Breakfast was the best I've had in any hotel bar none. Several of the staff were very friendly. They had whiskey soaked raisins for the porridge, plus cream and honey. All the usual cold items - but everything was top quality (cheese, breads, yogurts, juice, fruit). And the cooked menu was excellent. Wife had eggs benedict one day, and french toast & sausages the next. I had smoke salmon with egg on some kind of a potato cake with hollandaise sauce... so quite similar to eggs benedict but with a few differences. Location of the hotel is just excellent - a short stroll to the main street, and jarveys right outside.

Quiet escape in tranquil surroundings,"Stayed 2 nights in a junior suite. Lovely view over the front garden. Large room, enormous bed (super king size?). Good modern bathroom - with full bath. Robes & slippers provided - a nice touch. The hotel definitely has an old world air about it. Perfect if you want to get away from it all. There is a TV in the room with about ~10 channels. Wifi only available in the bar and mobile signals are quite poor... but that helps to encourage the escape. Breakfasts were good - with a selection of cereals, fruit, breads, etc... and a fresh cooked menu to choose from. Worth going to the spa for some treatments. My wife & I both had the mud spice baths, which began with a 5 min steam sauna in a clever ""sit in"" enclosure. A few minor quibbles.... my wife would have preferred if the bedding was of the more usual hotel fare, i.e. duvet with white cover - instead of a duvet there were several layers of blankets (probably useful if you wanted to regulate temperature). And a odd quirky thing due to the size of the bed was that the mattress pads were a little short of the edge. The curtains & blinds were insufficient to adequately block out morning light. However on balance, I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and quality of the hotel and would happily return.",May 2019,Seaview House Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1077209-d212609-Reviews-Seaview_House_Hotel-Ballylickey_Bantry_County_Cork.html,"Ballylickey, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.5
Gotta go for the fish,"Jam packed on a Saturday night. Enjoyed dinner with my wife. Wife had seafood chowder - tasty, but wish there had been more fish in it (we've had great chowder in USA, seems ""thinner"" here in Ireland). I don't remember the name of the starter i had, but it was like a seared sashimi - very nice. Mains for wife was the John Dory, while i had sea bass on caesar salad.

Very enjoyable dining experience,"Dined there with my wife. Had the full 4 courses plus coffee & petit fours. Overall a very enjoyable experience in a pleasant setting. We were encouraged to sit in the bar (by the lovely fire) and make our menu decisions at our leisure. I started with some very tender scallops, moved on to the vinegarette salad, mains was monkfish wrapped in bacon. All very tasty. Unfortunately i don't quite recollect the particular desert I had (as I was on a trip of several days... hence many meals out!). Coffee and chocolate were in the bar area by the fire again.

"An enjoyable evening, but a bit too pricey for us","Got a table by the fire Sat evening. There was a decent sized crowd there, and not too noisy. I had a tasty fish special main course (I think it was hake) with a selection of nice veg. The missus had the Hot Thai beef salad - she wasn't totally taken by it, as there didn't appear to be much salad involved, more noodles and stir fry, but I thought it was fairly nice. Most of the mains are priced €20~€35... starters €7~€17, and deserts ~€8. That's quite steep in my opinion. I don't recollect there being a 3 course package... but you'd need to budget €50/head if were planning on full meal. We only had the mains and tea/coffees. But they had a good sized crowd, so plenty of happy customers.",March 2019,The Ballymore Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1390165-d1139853-Reviews-The_Ballymore_Inn-Ballymore_Eustace_County_Kildare.html,"Ballymore Eustace, Ireland",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Would be happy to go again.",February 2019,Drago d'oro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d1091239-Reviews-Drago_d_oro-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great experience to see the underground,"Took an English speaking guided tour... I think it was €10 each. In a big group of 20+ people. You walk down steps and tunnels descending ~40 metres. Fascinating large water reservoirs from the Roman days. The underground caverns were used in WWII for refuge during air raids. There is 5 minute portion of the tour where you go through really narrow passageways - exciting, but they do harp on about the claustrophobia. It's optional. If you're claustrophobic just skip this part - simple! After the underground they brought us back up and across the street to another area where we could see part of the underground ruins of a an amphitheatre. They jsut built on top of it years and years ago! Well worth doing.",February 2019,Underground Naples,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187785-d2466778-Reviews-Underground_Naples-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Did 2 really excellent guided walks,"Wife & I did two walks with English speaking guide. Both were excellent. First was of the Old Town (the historic centre). It was really good. Not just for the historical and contextual info, but also the young woman made it really enjoyable. Well worth a good tip. There were ~10 of us on this tour and it lastest the full 2 hours. The second walk was of Neapolis - with a slightly larger group. This also was excellent. Very informative, and also well worth a good tip. I'd recommend these guys. It's a great way to get to know the city and hear some explanations.",February 2019,Free Walking Tour Napoli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187785-d7812563-Reviews-Free_Walking_Tour_Napoli-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5

Very nice atmosphere & food,"Ate tgere Friday evening. There are 2 parts to this restaurant across the street from each other. We ate in the small one with the chirping birds. Fantastic atmosphere for a romantic dinner. Lovely rough bare stone walls. Small, cosy and nice and warm for a February night. I had a fantastic fish medley... one the waiter recommended: jumbo prawn, mussels, some 7"" long fish, and other little shelfish. Wife had clam spaghetti. Not the cheapest... €44 including wine and cover... but by far the nicest dinner evening we had in our 4 night stay in Naples. Would recommend.",February 2019,Trattoria Speranzella,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d12907779-Reviews-Trattoria_Speranzella-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Okay. Reasonable prices.,"Wife had pizza marinera - normal. I had some gnocchi prima (nice) and then a swordfish secondi (Okay, but tough... but maybe that's swordfish). Very basic looking restaurant... no special atmosphere.

Wonderful boutique hotel & restaurant,"Stayed one night. Such a pity we were in a hurry. Lovely room. Very clean, nicely decorated, good view of the strand, lovely thick fluffy bathroom towels, nice breakfast in fab restaurant with great picture windows.

Nice hotel - just a noisy experience,"Second time staying there. First time was perfect. Not quite so perfect this time. Bedroom was nice. Huge bed. Clean and well furnished. No bath, but shower was really good. Breakfast was very good, although my wife had hoped there would have been a selection of pastries - didn't see anything muffins and scone-muffins. Went to an ABBA tribute show that evening in the hotel - a fun night, although the sound quality was not that great.There was also a large group of young athletics people staying in the hotel that Saturday night - pretty obvious from the minute we stepped into the lobby upon arrival. Bit messy. That took away a little from the ""couples weekend"" theme we were hoping for. And unfortunately after midnight there was a fair bit of noise from people running up & down the corridors and banging doors. My wife rang it in to reception around 2am. They helped, but didn't fully quell the noise until it ended of ""natural causes"". Apart the sleep disturbance and the bit of the loss of ambience, it's a nice hotel.",January 2019,Stormont Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186470-d192465-Reviews-Stormont_Hotel-Belfast_Northern_Ireland.html,"Belfast, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5

Clean modern hotel,"Stayed 3 nights in early November. Had a poolview room on 2nd floor. Very clean modern stylish room, with a huge bed! ~€70 night for half board. Breakfasts were good... with a selection of hot & cold items... some Moroccan dishes, some a little more European. 3 course dinner buffet was a little more traditional but quite tasty. Pool area was nice, with loungers, and eating/drinking by the bar. The pool area does fall into shade from 12~1pm onwards. Spa massages were too gentle.

Exceeded expectations,"My wife & I did a 4 day (3 night) private tour, starting in Marrakech, heading to Merzouga & the desert, and ending in Agadir. I discussed the trip with Mohamed by email, paid a deposit and took a leap of faith. Well everything lived up to the expectations and matched the reviews from other travellers. So well done Mohamed. Jamal was our driver and was great at his job. We learned so much about Morocco from Jamal.... he was a friendly and talkative guy. And not only did all the driving but effectively acted as our personal guide. We stayed one night in Hotel Babylon in Dades Gorge... room was fine... cold night, but room heater was great and food was very good. Desert experience was awesome. Sunset and sunrise were picture perfect. Again very cold at night! Stayed 3rd night in Zagora in Riad Lamane. Nice tropical setting. Dinner was superb! €800 total cost. Do realise that it's a LOT of driving, like 5~6 hours / day!",November 2018,Sahara Desert Tour - Day Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d7725781-Reviews-Sahara_Desert_Tour_Day_Tours-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",attractions,5.0,5.0
Nice to wander thru at night,"I wouldn't travel halfway round the world to see this square.. but if you're in Marrakech there's not a lot of interesting things to see and do, so you should at least wander thru this square. Lots of stalls and street sellers. Entertainers at night.

Nice cactus... but,"Sure it's a nice modestly sized garden full of cactus, arty things, and loads of tourists. We queued for at least 30 mins to get in. Paid €7 each plus a little extra to also see the Berber museum.... and the first thing we did when entered was go eat in the restaurant! Honestly it was all very nice... but when every single museum or palace cost €7 per person you get a bit tired of it all. The walk from the medina to these gardens was more culturally interesting.",November 2018,Jardin Majorelle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",attractions,3.0,4.5
Expect a hard sell!,"Realistically you should walk through the souks. It's fascinating... but such hassle and stress if you want to just browse. Leather, ceramics, clothing,... it's all there.
