"High point of Athens, both literally and figuratively","A must see for everybody interested in (one of) the roots of Western culture. As a bonus, you have a nice view over all parts of the city. In November, the weather is still nice (20+ degrees Celsius) but the crowds are gone, and you get a ticket at a reduced rate.",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent way to explore the center of Athens,Our guide Kostas did a very good job of entertaining us and showing some nice places around the Acropolis. Definitely a good way to recover from yesterday's marathon!,November 2019,Athens Scenic Bike Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11464352-Athens_Scenic_Bike_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
"Few tourists, many locals and good food!","We stumbled upon this restaurant by accident, but were pleasantly surprised. Our dishes (beef fillet with artichokes, ravioli with truffel sauce and risotto al salmone) were delicious and large enough to constitute dinner on their own.",April 2018,Antico Caffe Del Moro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d3916269-Reviews-Antico_Caffe_Del_Moro-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Definitely worth waiting half an hour for.,"There was a queue outside, but the American guy before us guaranteed us it would be worth the wait. He was there for the third evening in a row... That'd be a little too much for me, but the half-hour we had to wait paid off well. Pizza is rather cheap but they're really good and during the wait you can have a good look at how they make them.",April 2018,Al Forno della Soffitta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d1776145-Reviews-Al_Forno_della_Soffitta-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good hotel for a citytrip to Moscow,"This hotel was a good 'base camp' for our Moscow citytrip. Walking to the Moscow center (e.g. the Red Square) is doable - or you can just take the dirt cheap subway. Our room wasn't that large, but it was well-equipped. The reception was able to arrange some tickets for the Bolshoi Theatre - the day before the show -. Most of the staff speaks English quite decently.",May 2016,Mercure Moscow Paveletskaya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298484-d5970908-Reviews-Mercure_Moscow_Paveletskaya-Moscow_Central_Russia.html,"Moscow, Russia",hotels,4.0,4.5
