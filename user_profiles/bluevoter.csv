A mini-chain with several locations on Mykonos,"Well-prepared souvlaki at a reasonable price. The quality of the meat was very good, and service was fast. I think that the owners found a successful formula. I'd certainly go back.",April 2019,Souvlaki Story Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d14122748-Reviews-Souvlaki_Story_Taverna-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Nice place with outstanding service,"This attractive hotel is located just ""above"" Mykonos Town. The hotels slogan is that you arrive as a guest and leave as a friend. Before I arrived, the hotel contacted me and told me that they would pick me up at the airport if I provided my flight information - and so they did. They also will drive you back to the airport on departure.

The owner, Panos, greeted me on checkin, and introduced me to two members of his staff. It seemed that he was almost always at the counter or nearby, helping out with one thing or another. Does he sleep?

The lobby extends to a small bar and a larger room with a TV that has the ambience of a living room, leading out to the pool and the rooms. The buildings match the characteristic white color of Mykonos. While Mykonos Town is known for parties, the Aeolos was quiet both inside and outside the hotel.

There's a breakfast available for 12 euros - no bargain for me because I am a light breakfast eater and don't drink coffee - but the choices were extensive and it's a better value for most people. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they also serve dinner. One night I had their salad, which was excellent. Everything was fresh, and the salad was large enough that I didn't need anything else.

It's possible to walk down to the town and back up to the hotel. I was offered a ride down both days. One day, I walked back up - not too difficult if you are in good shape, but you will work up a sweat doing so. I popped for a taxi the next day.

All in all, a first-rate experience that I would repeat if I were to return to Mykonos.",April 2019,Aeolos Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g662620-d529847-Reviews-Aeolos_Resort-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0

An unexpected surprise worth an hour or two of your visit,"A collector of Asian art donated everything, which gives this museum an outstanding collection of Asian art. The collection is nicely displayed, with explanations in Greek and English, and is separated by different Asian cultures. I thought that the Chinese collection was the most impressive, with the oldest pieces more than 3000 years old. The Japanese selection was very good, and there are smaller displays from India and elsewhere. The accompanying posters show how Greece was tied to these other parts of the world, including mutual influences. Fascinating and educational.

I was very surprised to find such an impressive collection on the edge of a Greek island, especially since it's such a contrast to the local culture. Highly recommended.",April 2019,Corfu Museum of Asian Art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g662629-d196347-Reviews-Corfu_Museum_of_Asian_Art-Corfu_Town_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent room and service in a waterfront landmark,"One of the advantages of traveling off-season is the ability to find great rates at hotels that would normally cost more than you want to spend for a room. So I ended up in the first-rate Corfu Palace, which is directly across the street from the Ionian Sea.

Because of my flight schedule, I arrived at the hotel early in the morning (9am) and had an early evening (6pm) flight the next day. When I arrived, I was able to check into my room; on departure, the hotel gave me a late checkout (3pm). Extra points to them for this assistance.

My room was spacious, and everything worked well. The WiFi was fast and reliable. Breakfast was very good, with plenty of choices. There's a casino off the lobby, which may appeal to some travelers.

It's about a 10 minute walk to the Old Fort, the Asian Art Museum, and Liston, and slightly less to reach Corfu Town's main shopping area. That made it easy to see the town's major sights. There's a lot to see on the island, and the Corfu Palace makes a good base for that. I'd gladly return to this hotel if I were again on Corfu.",April 2019,Corfu Palace Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g662629-d228902-Reviews-Corfu_Palace_Hotel-Corfu_Town_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Excellent new hotel with views of Meteora monasteries,"This hotel was chosen by my tour operator for my overnight stay before visiting Meteora. It's very nice, with a relatively large room where everything is new. As part of a tour group, dinner and breakfast buffets were included. These were OK, but nothing special.

The hotel is away from the towns of Kastraki and Kalampaka, so there's not much in the vicinity, and you need a car to get around if you are traveling independently.",April 2019,Grand Meteora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1070999-d8721425-Reviews-Grand_Meteora-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
This is why you came to Athens,"There's nothing like the Acropolis, the second highest hill in Athens (after Lycabettus Hill). It's home to the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, and more. Note that the Acropolis is why *everyone* came to Athens, and that it is mobbed by tour groups by mid-morning, making it hard to get up and down. If you are traveling independently, you should plan to be here not later than 8:30am so that you can see these historical gems in relative peace.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
World-class collection of Greek antiquities,"If you want to see Greek antiquities up close and learn more about the history of the Greek empire, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, Lord Elgin stole many artifacts that are now in the British Museum, but you could still spend endless hours looking at pieces that date to the 7th Century BC.",April 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A well-located three star hotel,"The Attalos is a seven story hotel with a roof bar and garden not far from the Monastaraki Metro station, the Plaka area, and the main historic and archeological sites of Athens. I had arranged my trip so that I had three separate stays totaling 6 nights over a 10 day period, with two side trips in between. I packed a small bag inside my suitcase so that I was able to take the things I needed for the side trips and leave the suitcase with the hotel. Very helpful!

I stayed in three different rooms, all quite similar in size and amenities. Even though I was traveling solo, I think that two people could have stayed in the room without too much trouble. Everything worked well in the room, though it took a couple of days' practice to keep the bathroom floor relatively dry when I used the small shower.

It's possible to include breakfast in the room rate, which I did. The breakfast is OK, with plenty of choices, but my desire for freshly squeezed orange juice eventually drove me to eat at the excellent Beneth cafe/bakery next door.

The roof bar is open until midnight and offers a spectacular view of the Parthenon on the Acropolis.

I discovered a laundromat about 3 blocks away, close to Monastaraki, where you can do your own wash or have the attendant do it overnight. That came in handy. There is also an excellent market for fruits and veggies about three blocks north (away from Monastaraki toward Omonia).

As you walk along Athinas Street and around the neighborhood, you can see some effects of Greece's decade of economic crisis. There are some homeless people on the sidewalk and lots of graffiti, unfortunate but not dangerous.

Would I stay at the Attalos again? Absolutely. It's a good value in an excellent location with a helpful staff.",April 2019,Attalos Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d235705-Reviews-Attalos_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent food and service despite late walk-in,"I started walking back toward my hotel from the Münchner Freiheit MVV station and found this restaurant about a block north, opposite the small park. My expectations for a Thai restaurant in Germany weren't high, but I was very pleasantly surprised, especially since I arrived only about 15 minutes before closing.

They have a very small open cooking area, with tables inside and out. I chose the Nua Mun Mun beef dish with a Singha beer. The beef dish was quite large and very well prepared; the quality of the beef was better than I usually find in Thai dishes. I would gladly return. With the Metro (MVV) stop close by, it's not hard to get there from the historic center.",April 2019,MUN MUN - Thai Cooking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187309-d10372782-Reviews-MUN_MUN_Thai_Cooking-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,"Munich, Germany",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"A New York style deli in the New York, New York hotel","You can work up an appetite for a sandwich just trying to get here if you are not staying in the hotel. From the self parking area, you walk into the hotel and off to the farthest corner, where you will find Greenberg's. I ordered a very lean corned beef sandwich on rye bread - plain - to go. The sandwich was very good, but they couldn't resist putting mustard on the bread. Perhaps they didn't understand ""plain"". It's a bit of a hassle to get here, but the food was good and the sandwich was reasonably priced. (Not everything else was.)

I've been here before, and I would return in the future if I should have to return to Las Vegas.",January 2019,Greenberg's Deli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d1939064-Reviews-Greenberg_s_Deli-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,4.0,4.5
An excellent breakfast and a good value,"Fresh orange juice! Excellent.

Lots of choice with eggs: omelettes, etc., but I went for the blueberry pancakes with fresh blueberries. Real maple syrup was available, so it was easy to eat enough for breakfast to make it unnecessary to eat for the rest of the day.

Service was fast an friendly, and I would not hesitate to return, especially if I were hungry.",January 2019,The Egg & I,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d449411-Reviews-The_Egg_I-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Ugh. A sprawling, smoky, hotel casino","For me, going to Las Vegas is like being in an alien environment, which affects my opinion of everything there. But here I was very generous to the Orleans in my overall rating of the property. It's less than two miles East of the Strip along Tropicana, and the hotel offers a regular shuttle to the strip. Cab fare or ride-sharing to the Strip is less than $10 each way.

The hotel rooms are arrayed along three *long* corridors served by four central elevators. As in the former Soviet Union, you must show a room key to be granted access to the elevator by the armed and uniformed guard. It's a long walk from either the valet parking or self-parking areas to this point, which is not very desirable in a hotel where bellmen are in short supply unless you are easily able to manage your own bags.

My room, as with most rooms in Las Vegas, was designed on the premise that you wouldn't spend much time there. The TV worked and offered 15-20 stations. The bathroom fixtures were old, but the toilet flushed and the shower produced an adequate amount of water pressure with no shortage of hot water.

The hotel promotes its ""high speed Internet"" but the fine print describes that as 1Mb downloading speed. My home DSL service in 1997 was twice as fast as that, so 1Mb is pretty much a joke, and you shouldn't even think about streaming anything here. But that's understandable: they want you in the casino.

I've traveled all over the world, visiting dozens of countries in the past decade, and have never, repeat never, previously found a hotel where there was a charge to print a boarding pass. (I ended up in the lobby of a different hotel, which provided anyone with about 12 minutes of free Internet time and free printing of my boarding pass.)

Finally, there's one big plus: the on-site movie multiplex with about 20 theaters. It's a bit of a hike from the hotel rooms, but nonetheless a useful resource.",January 2019,The Orleans Hotel & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d91907-Reviews-The_Orleans_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,3.0,4.0
Good but not great,"After seeing the other reviews of this restaurant, I hoped that it would be a real ""find"", especially in a city that is heavily dominated by chain restaurants. The ambience and service were very good, even though it is located in a strip shopping mall.

I had the cream of mushroom soup, which was outstanding, and the scaloppine marsala, which fell short of my expectations because the meat was too tough. It could have used some more pounding and/or trimming. But the price was reasonable, and you could easily do much worse. I wouldn't be in any rush to go back here, but it seems to be popular with the locals.",January 2019,Vincitorio's Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g31377-d861176-Reviews-Vincitorio_s_Restaurant-Tempe_Arizona.html,"Tempe, Arizona",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Budget motel on Phoenix-Tempe border,"The Phoenix area sprawls widely, and the geographical size of Tempe is considerably larger than most cities. The La Quinta is located in the NW corner of Tempe, but it's not too far to downtown Tempe (Mill Street) and Arizona State University. It's only about 15 minutes to the overwhelming Arizona Mills mall, which has a 25-way movie theater as its redeeming feature. It took me about 12 minutes to the rental car return at Sky Harbor Airport.

The La Quinta is just OK, with two stories of standard motel rooms. They have a shuttle to the nearby airport, and serve a simple complimentary breakfast. Everything was in order in my room, which included a microwave and a refrigerator. For the second floor, there's an elevator, but it's not very conveniently located, so you should plan on carrying your luggage up the steps if you are assigned to the upper floor.

Would I stay here again? Maybe. The price was right this time, and I just had a quick overnight stay. I wouldn't want to stay here for more than two nights, though.",January 2019,La Quinta Inn by Wyndham Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g31377-d74318-Reviews-La_Quinta_Inn_by_Wyndham_Phoenix_Sky_Harbor_Airport-Tempe_Arizona.html,"Tempe, Arizona",hotels,3.0,3.5
Focus on Native American culture,"This museum has four areas that display the culture and history of Native Americans in Arizona. We know that the US Government killed a vast number on Native Americans and took their land, forcing the remaining tribes onto desolate and remote reservations.

"Lots of old planes, with a tilt toward military aircraft","There are some indoor displays, including old aircraft hanging from the ceiling, along with a very large tarmac with about 100 planes. There's an old Constellation with TWA livery, a couple of Air Force Ones (one propeller and one jet), and lots of other planes to see. I wouldn't want to go here in the summer, when the sun reflecting off the tarmac would increase the hot temperatures to unbearable. The museum offers a tour through the tarmac area on wheels, and also has an arrangement with the nearby Davis-Monahan air force base that allows you to take a guided tour through their airplane boneyard, with hundreds of decommissioned aircraft.",January 2019,Pima Air and Space Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60950-d109172-Reviews-Pima_Air_and_Space_Museum-Tucson_Arizona.html,"Tucson, Arizona",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice place in office park,"One of the nice things about staying in an office park is that rates are low over the weekend, and the neighborhood is quiet. Parking is easy and free. It's about a 15 minute drive to get here from downtown, but there's not all that much to see and do downtown, so this is a better location.

Marriott now has something like 30 different hotel brands, many of which are indistinguishable. To me, there's not much difference between a TowneSuite and the better known Residence Inn, except for the late afternoon ""happy hour"" at the latter. Maybe the TowneSuites are less expensive.

The rooms are fine, the wi-fi works, and there are plenty of TV choices. It's not far to Broadway, the main East-West thoroughfare, with lots of shopping, restaurants, and all of the basic needs. There's also a pool and a fitness center. If I were to change anything, it would be to upgrade the breakfast choices, which are OK by American free breakfast standards, but not much more.",January 2019,TownePlace Suites Tucson Williams Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60950-d2322344-Reviews-TownePlace_Suites_Tucson_Williams_Centre-Tucson_Arizona.html,"Tucson, Arizona",hotels,5.0,4.5
A warm welcome for returning guests,"I stayed in this hotel four years ago, and reviewed it then. This time I came not only as a member of Marriott's Rewards Club, but also as a returning guest. The amenities included a bottle of wine, fresh fruit and more, along with a late checkout. They even knew the room in which I had stayed and apologized for not putting me in an equally high room. (Given the fog, it wouldn't have mattered, since you couldn't see anything from anywhere in the hotel when I was there.)

The hotel is very convenient to the metro system (exit 11 from People's Square station) and to East Nanjing Road, the main shopping street that leads to the Bund and the Huangpu River.

For me, the big attraction is the buffet breakfast, which was included in my room rate, but otherwise is about $35 US. That makes the hotel seem much more affordable. I must confess that I ate much more than I usually do, so I can accurately say that the choices were very good, and that they had items to satisfy both Western and Chinese tastes. One more benefit: I was able to reject all of United's meal offerings, which have continued to deteriorate.

One minor note: Marriott is a Pepsi place, so Coke drinkers must stock up elsewhere. Fortunately, there are many small shops in the area, so it is easy to address this issue.",December 2018,JW Marriott Hotel Shanghai at Tomorrow Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g308272-d299747-Reviews-JW_Marriott_Hotel_Shanghai_at_Tomorrow_Square-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",hotels,5.0,4.5
A big campus for a well-regarded university,"I've been to several of the larger Chinese universities, but Zhejiang looks more like a traditional American campus than any other I have seen.

Very pretty lake with available boats,"West Lake is a highlight of Hangzhou, visited by locals and tourists alike. I went on a misty, cool December morning, and spent about an hour walking the paths, mostly on the side of the larger lake. I can imagine that the trails and the lake are much busier in the summer months, perhaps to the point of overcrowding.

"An apartment hotel next to a huge, upscale shopping mall","Intime City is a destination in Hangzhou, with the high rise Citadines Hotel as its nearby neighbor.

My suite was quite large with a comfortable king-sized bed, a working area, and a kitchen/dining area. The kitchen area has a refrigerator and stove-top cooking, and comes with pots and pans, dishes, and Western silverware. I could easily imagine staying there for a week, sort of halfway between Extended Stay America and Residence Inn. The WiFi was a bit flaky, requiring frequent logins, but overall it worked well.

But there's considerable room for improvement. As in the US, the hotel is pretty much a single language operation. You can't expect that the hotel staff will speak any language other than Mandarin fluently. Make sure that your mobile phone has a good translator app and that you know how to use it.

The hotel's breakfast selection is OK for the hotel's price range, and there's also a fitness center and a launderette.

In four nights there, my sheets were not changed and the bottom sheet had a couple of holes. Perhaps they change the sheets weekly. Fortunately, they were much better with bathroom towels, changing them daily if you left your towels in the tub or on the floor.

If you look carefully in the lower level of the adjacent shopping mall, you will find the upscale BLT Supermarket. There you can find many Western items at high, but not extreme, prices. For Westerners staying more that a couple of days, I strongly recommend going here for some additional items - I brought cereal with me from home, and bought low-fat milk, bananas, and berries here.",December 2018,Citadines Intime City Hangzhou Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298559-d7234444-Reviews-Citadines_Intime_City_Hangzhou_Hotel-Hangzhou_Zhejiang.html,"Hangzhou, China",hotels,4.0,4.0
Puts most other subway systems to shame,"Fast, clean, and not expensive, with extensive route coverage of Shanghai and its major areas.

Slower this time - from 432 km/hr to 301 km/hr top speed,"From People's Square to the modern Pudong airport doesn't take very long at all. The Number 2 metro line makes a convenient connection at Longyang station where the Maglev train departs every 15 minutes and then takes less than 8 minutes to go the 25 km (15 mi) to Pudong International Airport. When I made the trip in 2014, top speed was 432 km/hr (268 mph), but this time it topped out at 301 km/hr, slower than the French TGV and similar trains in Germany, Spain, and Italy. The new Eurostar does 320 at its top speed. Nonetheless, it's enjoyable to take this quick and nearly silent ride to the airport, as well as a reminder of how far the US is falling behind much of the developed world in transportation infrastructure.",December 2018,Maglev Transportation,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g308272-d9594458-Reviews-Maglev_Transportation-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",attractions,5.0,4.5
Don't miss Jason's supermarket on the lower level,"I went to the observatory at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai in 2012, so I thought that I would do the same here. But my time was limited, the line to go up was long, and a ticket was $20 US, so I used my time to explore the rest of the building.

The entrance to the observatory is on the fifth floor. The first four floors are dominated by high priced luxury stores, the same ones that you can find in wealthy areas all over the world. But there's an Apple Store and a branch of Zara, so it wasn't a total loss.

The lower level is more interesting. There's a fancy food court, with food representing many different types of cuisine. Prices are above average, but that's to be expected since the different places are probably paying a premium rental rate to be in a highly desirable location. By accident, I discovered Jason's Market Place, a high-end supermarket. Their selection was excellent, and I even bought a package of blueberries from Chile on sale at a price comparable to what I pay at home in the US. Given more time, I could easily have bought a lot more. So I originally came for the view, but I went away with the blueberries.

In the middle of everything - excellent staff,"The Via Hotel is located close to the pedestrian zone in the very popular Wanhua area, close to Ximen Station. A taxi can get you within half a block, but not to the door. Iused the train from the airport to Taipei Station and changed to the Blue Line of the MRT for the one stop to Ximen, then used Exit 6 which is closest to the hotel. But it's a long walk from the airport train to the Blue Line.

I liked the hotel, where I was warmly greeted and well treated. In addition to breakfast, they keep snacks and drinks out at all hours, so you won't ever be hungry there. Because of its proximity to Ximen Station with its two metro lines, the hotel makes a good base for exploring Taipei. I thought that the room rate was reasonable.

As for my room, all of the necessities were there. The bath/shower was good, the TV and WiFi worked, and the bed was reasonably comfortable. There's a refrigerator to keep the items that you can buy at the 7/11 on the corner.

There's a table top that can serve as a working area with electrical outlets for most plugs, both 110 and 220 volts. But the chair was much too low for working with a computer on the tabletop, so I stacked a couple of pillows on the chair to make it work. There's a small couch, but it isn't very deep and it seemed to be more for decoration than for actual use by an adult-sized person. There's a free guest laundry, too, but you should be prepared to compete with other guests for the machines.

I would give the hotel a top rating for all of this, except that my room was windowless. I had to go down to the reception area to check on the weather, and the room felt a bit claustrophobic after a while. But if I were back in Taipei and could be assured of a room with a window, then I would gladly stay here again.",December 2018,Via Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g13806951-d3134481-Reviews-Via_Hotel-Wanhua_Taipei.html,"Wanhua, Taipei",hotels,4.0,4.5
A very good find in Silicon Valley,"It's become quite common for budget chain motels in Silicon Valley to charge upwards of $200/night (plus taxes) for a room, especially during the work week. There's nothing special about these places, except that they are a bargain next to the well-known mid-priced chains, which charge $300/night or more. (These are tonight's prices, and we don't have any major events happening here. It's just the normal state of affairs.)

The Hotel Zico is a boutique hotel not far from the intersection of Hwy 85 and El Camino Real, easy to reach from the East and a bit tricky from the west. I was lucky to get an excellent rate last night, but the rate tripled for tonight, so I couldn't stay a second night.

I felt like a welcome guest there. The room was comfortable, with a king sized bed, a desk and an adjustable mesh chair, and (of course) free high speed internet. Everything in the room and bathroom worked fine. The towels were better than average. There's a small area near reception where you can buy various snacks and drinks at reasonable prices. There's also free underground parking. The included breakfast includes made-to-order eggs of various types.

I had only a couple of minor issues: 1) the bed pillows were hard and uncomfortable; good thing that I brought my own down pillow; 2) the toiletries - lotion, shampoo, conditioner - had a very strong scent; good thing that I brought my own, since I would otherwise have given off a very strong odor out in public.

My office is not far away and I occasionally find it useful to stay in Silicon Valley when I have an early morning meeting there, thus avoiding the horrible and unreliable commute on 101 from San Francisco.

What happened here?,"I've previously written highly favorable reviews of Xanh, but my recent experience has caused me to reassess my review. As we all know, restaurants change over time: new cooks, new owners, etc.

I went solo for dinner and ordered the Miso Salmon as my main (and only) course. When it arrived the fish was warm, not hot, leading me to believe that it had sat out somewhere between being cooked and my being served. I sent it back for reheating, but that's always a problem, and the dish returned hot, but overcooked. The server saw that I was not happy with the result. She took 15% off the check and said, ""There's no manager on duty, and this is the most that I can do."" To me, ""no manager on duty"" is a bad sign, and reflects a lack of attention to the overall experience. Even the least expensive fast food chains have a manager on duty.

Given my experience with the food and the absence of a manager, it appears that someone has taken his eye off the ball. At least with the lunchtime buffet, it's easy to work your way around any dish that isn't up to par, but when you order a single item, you are stuck if there is a problem and no manager to help.",December 2018,Xanh Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32761-d614188-Reviews-Xanh_Restaurant-Mountain_View_California.html,"Mountain View, California",restaurants,3.0,4.0
A great value and much better than I expected,"In a city where even the cheap motels charge over $100/night off season, I was a bit apprehensive about staying at the low-priced Quality Inn. It had been a long time since I had stayed in one of their places.

When I arrived, the desk clerk quoted me a rate that was higher than the rate I had found online. That struck me as unusual, since most hotels offer a lower rate to those who book directly. So I got out my computer and booked the reservation online at the lower price while standing at the check-in counter. Problem solved.

The building is a narrow two story motel style structure, probably built in the 1960s. My room was upstairs in the back. The furniture showed a bit of wear and tear, but everything was clean, the wi-fi wss fast, there were lots of digital TV choices on the 32: HDTV, including HBO, and there was a well-lit desk. The room also had a mini-fridge and a microwave oven. All in all, very impressive.

My only issue was with the heating and air-conditioning unit. It has low and high heating and cooling, but only one fan speed. On a cool evening, it's easy to dry out the air completely and bake in high head. So I had to carefully adjust the uncalibrated heating dial until the air coming out of the unit matched the temperature of the room. It took a few tries, but it all worked out in the end.

The rate includes breakfast in their compact three-table dining area. Again, the food choices and quality exceeded my expectations, though I was glad to have brought my own breakfast cereal instead of choosing between their Fruit Loops and Raisin Bran.

The front desk isn't always attended, so I left my room key and hoped for the best. Overall, though, it was a great value for the money, and conveniently located as well. While I usually day-trip Santa Cruz from home, I would consider staying at this Quality Inn again.",December 2018,Quality Inn Santa Cruz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33048-d79933-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Santa_Cruz-Santa_Cruz_California.html,"Santa Cruz, California",hotels,4.0,4.0
Multiple spatulas needed,"Ewww! The spatula used to pick up my vegetarian slice had just been used on a slice of deep dish pizza covered in ham and pepperoni. Gross.

We tried again, but the second slice sat in the oven too long and was barely edible. For a place that supposedly wins awards and gets good reviews, I was at a loss to understand why people like it, but I guess that they were comparing it to the huge national chains or they had a different experience.

Is it fair to give a poor review on the basis of a single slice? Sure, since I'm writing about my experience: food and service. Would I go back to another store in their chain? Not likely. Pizza has a lot of calories, so my attitude is that they should be worthwhile calories. :Pizza My Heart didn't deliver on that (sorry about the pun).",December 2018,Pizza My Heart,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33048-d468588-Reviews-Pizza_My_Heart-Santa_Cruz_California.html,"Santa Cruz, California",restaurants,2.0,4.5

Excellent Italian restaurant in Mumbai!?!,"Your first question might be why I would choose to have an Italian dinner in Mumbai. In the past, some of the worst meals I have ever had were in such non-native locales, such as Mexican in Paris and Queenstown, NZ, or hamburgers in numerous places.

But I didn't choose; my host, a long term resident of Mumbai, did, and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. For me, there are a few dishes that are my best indicators of an Italian restaurant. So I started with risotto and finished with tiramisú, and had a glass of Barolo. I can't say much about the other items on the menu, but my choices were all very good. The service was fine and the price was reasonable. Plus, it was a good break from chicken tikka masala and rogan josh.

If I lived close to the restaurant, as my host does, then I would probably go back, especially if Milano wasn't on my short-term travel itinerary. For me, as a visitor, Gustoso was an interesting curiosity, but I would probably choose to explore some of Mumbai's multitude of dining options on a future trip.",October 2018,Gustoso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d10631177-Reviews-Gustoso-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Still the best for travel to Asia,"On a recent trip from San Francisco to Hong Kong, I flew west on United and returned on Singapore. Both flights used a B777-300, so a head-to-head comparison seems right. I flew in Economy Plus on United and Economy with Singapore, but had more space on the Singapore flight because the seat was wider and the leg room was comparable. To be fair to United, their entertainment system was just as good as Singapore's. But Singapore was superior not just in seating area, but efficiency of boarding, meal service and quality (even a printed menu!), mid-flight snack options, and restroom cleanliness. I came away wondering why anyone would choose to fly United over Singapore on that route unless they were compelled to do so.

When does service become harassment?,"The LaLit Great Eastern is a famous historic hotel that has been remodeled into a lovely modern hotel. My room was very large, with a comfortable king size bed. There's a well lit desk for working and a comfortable chair for relaxing. The WiFi works fine and the Internet is not bad, though I did not pay extra for the ""premium"" service. There's a minibar (but no price list), a safe, and plenty of removable hangers in the closet. In the bath, there is a large walk-in shower with both a handheld and rainfall shower, and no problem with sufficient hot water. The hotel provides toiletries, but the scent is lavender, and I chose not to walk around smelling of lavender all day; good thing I brought my own shampoo and shower gel.

The breakfast was outstanding, one of the best I have had anywhere, with choices for almost any imaginable taste or dietary preference. Fresh fruit, home-baked mini-pastries, mostly of European type, even something round with a hole that they called a bagel. It was literally enough food for the entire day, especially if you ordered the included eggs with their side accompaniments. I would easily gain weight if I had their breakfast every day.

There's a fitness center and an outdoor pool, too.

So what's not to like, or why only four stars? First, it's the oppressive service. Nine Namaste greetings between the entrance and the lift, from the doorman to the security guard, people behind the counter, people standing around doing very little, and the button pusher for the lift. This happens every time you enter the lobby. The staff must be trained by management to consider it an insult if a guest wants to push his own button for the lift or the floor, even though we have proven ourselves capable of doing this task when we go from our room to the lobby.

Second, you shouldn't count on the ""concierge desk"" for anything that doesn't involve selling a hotel service. No one there will ever get a Gold Key. I asked for a city map - after 15 minutes, the first person was unable to find one, but someone else eventually succeeded. I asked for the location of the local tourist authority, since it is necessary to visit them to gain admission to Marble House. That didn't work either - I was pointed toward their location, but it seemed to be a former location of the tourism office, so no Marble House for me. The people behind the concierge desk were similarly useless about the Metro. I had no problem sorting it out for myself, but I am surely not the first guest who wants to use public transportation instead of haggling every fare with taxi drivers who raise their requested rate in mid-trip. The prepaid taxi fare from the airport was INR 380; the hotel charges INR 2700 for the return, perhaps to help pay for all of the staff that stands around in the lobby doing very little except making Namaste greetings to the guests.

Don't hesitate to stay here - it's an excellent hotel and you will like the attention on your first entry to the hotel. But it gets quite ridiculous by the third time, and finally quite unpleasant. I shouldn't have to tell someone that I am able to push the button for the lift all by myself.",October 2018,The Lalit Great Eastern Kolkata,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304558-d1155602-Reviews-The_Lalit_Great_Eastern_Kolkata-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",hotels,4.0,5.0
Average neighborhood Italian place - Meh,"If your standard for Italian food is Olive Garden or Round Table, then Vittorio is a great place. It's a sincere, family-owned, and very popular place in San Francisco's West Portal neighborhood. But it falls short of the standards of the better neighborhood Italian places that can be found around town.

Our family have been regulars at another Italian restaurant about a block closer to downtown, but thought that we should check out Vittorio's, seeing its popularity, even though it was about 10% more expensive. We ordered the same items - as closely as possible - as the other restaurant: veal scallopine marsala, gnocchi, and ravioli. The ravioli was very good, and the veal was OK, with a tasty sauce and plenty of mushrooms. The accompanying vegetables were crunchy, and the potatoes felt as if they had spent to much time under a heat lamp. The gnocchi was a major disappointment; it seemed as if it had been defrosted and heated, and then covered with tomato sauce. There was no way for us to tell if it was made in house or not.",September 2018,Trattoria Da Vittorio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d4308861-Reviews-Trattoria_Da_Vittorio-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Excellent convention center and cruise terminal location on waterfront,"The hotel and its service were very good. The bed was very comfortable, the pillows were great, and everything worked quite well, except for the toilets, which are showing their age. Checkin and checkout were easy. I didn't turn on the TV, so I don't know what was available or the charges for various channels.

I was there as part of a group attending a convention, so the WiFi was included in the rate. If I went as an independent traveler, I would have to pay C$15/night for decent WiFi - forget the less expensive option. This extortionate rate seems to be common among the expensive hotels in this neighborhood; the moderately priced hotels offer free WiFi.

There are items for sale in a small refrigerator and drawer, as with the typical minibar. But there's no place for guests to store their own drinks, fruit, medicine, or anything else needing refrigeration.

I switched rooms during my stay. Unfortunately, I left a couple of small items in the bath of the first room. When I mentioned them to the hotel and housekeeping a few hours later, they were unable to find them and return them. Odd, especially since they were of minimal value.

Public transportation is very good, especially to and from YVR (airport). Less than 30 minutes and less than C$4 on the Skytrain each way. It's less than 2 blocks from the hotel to the Skytrain. Other Metro lines are even closer.

The immediate neighborhood of the hotel is well equipped for visitors, since it is home to the cruise terminal and the convention center.

Marked down because of those change fees....,"Wonder of wonders, an upgrade! Since I only have Mileage Plus Gold status in a world of frequent tech travelers in the SF Bay Area, I always found myself way way down on the upgrade list when I flew United. I long ago stopped looking for my initials on the screen, and always ate before my domestic flights. So there I was in my Economy Plus seat when a gate agent came up to me with a new boarding pass - row 2, which came with more space and dinner.

It was only a 2 hour flight, but I was pleased with the upgrade and the flight overall. As usual, though, my ""priority"" tagged bag was among the last to come onto the carousel when I arrived in Vancouver. But that's a minor issue, since the flight was trouble-free and arrived on time.

I can't give United a higher rating, though, since I have had to pay their extortionate change fees on several occasions over the past couple of years.

In addition to the Nutshell tour, I also bought Oslo and Bergen city passes through them; everything was waiting for me as expected.

Don't miss the Wine bar,"The Radisson Blu towers over the Dammtor station and the surrounding neighborhood, just west of the Binnen Alster, near Planten and Bloemen. It's basically a modernist eyesore. But if we put that issue aside (except for lowering the overall rating), it's also quite a good hotel, and a good base for exploring Hamburg, particularly if you like to walk, as I do.

My room was comfortable, though the pillows were not to my liking. Everything in the room worked fine. My room rate did not include breakfast, but I found many good options in the Dammtor station, and my total cost was far less than the price for the full breakfast offered by the hotel. (It's not a fair comparison, since I don't normally have a hot breakfast and don't drink coffee.)

It's one stop from Dammtor to the main train station (Hauptbahnhof) where it's an easy cross-platform connection to the airport train. Basically, it costs just over 3 euros for the 30 minute trip to the airport. Four of the metro (U-bahn) lines are in the Hbf, so it's quite easy to get almost anywhere in the area that way. However, I easily walked from the hotel to the Rathausmarket (Town Hall Square) in 15-20 minutes. You can also rent a bike from the hotel.

The Wine bar is on the 26th floor of the hotel, so you have great views in several directions from there. You can go outside and hold your camera over the partitions (carefully!) to get excellent aerial shots. The choices for wine were quite good, and I was pleasantly surprised with my selection.

Would I return to the Radisson Blu if I were back in Hamburg? Nothing against the Radisson, but I might choose to stay closer to the harbor (haven) area, where there are a lot of new developments along with the river and the ferries.

Modern highrise convention hotel outside the Old Town,"If you are coming to Tallinn as a tourist, then the beautiful and well-preserved Old Town is the main attraction. The Hilton is a 10-15 minute walk away (depending on your route). So that knocks it down a notch in my rating, and I should probably have also dropped it because of the adjacent casino. I also strongly dislike the two-tier WiFi model used by the Hilton chain. Standard WiFi is about 10 years behind current speeds, so you end up paying about 12 euros or dollars per night to receive acceptable WiFi. Breakfast is also extra, about 20 euros.

When I was there, the hotel was filled with people coming for a UEFA tournament, and their displays dominated the lobby.

My room, apart from the WiFi, was very nice. The room was of good size, and everything worked. I made a good discovery. If you walk out the front door, turn left, and walk two blocks, you will come to a main street. The 2 and 4 trams stop on the side closest to you, and take you to the Old Town for 2 euros - pay on the tram. If you cross the street, the 4 tram takes you directly to the airport, where it literally parks in front of the entrance.

I only stayed there for one night, and moved to a hotel in the Old Town. The atmosphere was much better there, even when the main streets were filled with day trippers from their cruise ships.

Even though the hotel is a perfectly good hotel with all of the amenities of a four-star hotel, I can't recommend staying there if your reason for being in Tallinn is to see the historic sites.",August 2018,Hilton Tallinn Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274958-d290521-Reviews-Hilton_Tallinn_Park-Tallinn_Harju_County.html,"Tallinn, Estonia",hotels,4.0,4.5

Relais et Chateaux hotel in the Old Town,"I was drawn here by the combination of a reasonable price and the Relais et Chateaux membership, and I was not disappointed. The hotel is small, created from three adjacent houses, and opened about 15 years ago. So we have a historic structure complemented by modern fixtures and technology. Breakfast is included in the rate, and I considered the breakfast to be good, not great.

The hotel staff was extremely helpful, and knowledgeable about the city. Their help led me to give the Three Sisters a top rating instead of a ""Very Good"".

The Three Sisters is located in the northeast corner of the Old Town, not far from Fat Margaret's Tower and the Great Coastal Gate. If you walk through the gate, you are very close to the 1 and 2 trams, which will take you all over Tallinn, as well as to the harbor and the cruise ships.
