Amazing View,The sunset in Oia is an amazing site. We took the tour bus to Oia from our hotel in Fira and spent the evening in Oia. It is a wonderful city to visit and the sunset view was a sight to remember.,October 2019,Sunset in Oia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482941-d3369820-Reviews-Sunset_in_Oia-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A Fun Time,This was such a fun experience. It was my first time to Paddle Board and was a great activity. The weather was great. The guides for this tour are so friendly and helpful. I left my shoes at the paddleboard area and called to see if they found them. They were so nice and delivered them to my hotel for me the same evening. So nice!,October 2019,Santorini: Stand-Up Paddle and Snorkel Adventure,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189433-d15646656-Santorini_Stand_Up_Paddle_and_Snorkel_Adventure-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
Such a Fun Experience,"This was our first meal in Athens and was so amazing. Our hosts, Dimitris and Savvros were so friendly and entertaining. They prepared the most wonderful meal for us and we met some very interesting travelers who joined us for dinner. Their home overlooks the Acropolis and the night time view is just magnificent. I would definitely do this again in the future.",October 2019,Dimitris And Savvas of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d13276866-Reviews-Dimitris_And_Savvas_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Breathtaking!,The Acropolis is breathtaking when you finally get there. The walk up is not for the faint of heart. :) Wear gripping shoes and go when it's not humid. But so worth the effort. The pictures that we took can't show how truly fantastic it is.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
