Absolutely brilliant,"This place provides a great place to hang out in Athens during the night. There are alcohol and non alcohol drinks on the menu. I tried one of the mocktails and it tasted great. Much needed on a warm spring evening in the busy city. Location is great, you can get wonderful views of the acropolis and the rooftop garden provides a great place for photos. Waiters are friendly, service was generally quick. I would definitely recommend coming here during your visit!",March 2019,360 Degrees,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3694462-Reviews-360_Degrees-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Truly Beautiful!,Lovely to explore and chill out. Lovely temple to see. Amazing to get photos. Amazing views of the acropolis. I would recommend visiting in the same day as the acropolis!,March 2019,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
MUST DO IN ATHENS!,"We walked up to the acropolis and it was a steep but enjoyable trip from the ancient Agora to the Acropolis. Ticket office is easy to access and walk up to the structures is very nice even in warm weather (make sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring water with you). Views of Athens are stunning as well as of the acropolis.

We actually went there towards the end of the day and it was still a good experience, though there are still quite a lot of people there. It is much less than the middle of the day as people were leaving... Meaning we could get those one on one shots at the acropolis. I'd advice either heading there super early or around 3:30ish if you want good pictures. As we went in March, opening hours are according to winter timing so summer times will be different and much busier.",March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Quick bite,"We went here twice during our visit to Reykjavík. Good quick bite, very filling. I would recommend to stick to the shawarma wraps. Owner claimed it is halal.

Delicious pizza!,"We visited a few times as this restaurant was right outside of our hotel. Whether you want a small bite to eat or a full on Italian feast, it can accommodate for both. We headed here for a quick bite after an excursion. We wanted half a 12"" pizza each between the two of us and the chef prepared it and even cut it in half for us so we wouldn't have to attempt to

Staff are very attentive and it's a busy place in the evenings when we went. However, I felt like we were rushed out so they could sit new customers, even though there was no rush. Very confusing and had to knock off a star for that...

The next few night we got pizza take away and it tasted just as great back at our hotel.",January 2019,Hornid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d696164-Reviews-Hornid-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great birthday dinner,"I went with friends for a lovely little catch up. We made reservations for Saturday evening and the table was ready for us when we arrived. The waitress took our drink orders and food orders in a good amount of time. The food at first seems like there isn't enough chicken but actually once I finished the meal, I was sooo full. My friend was even telling me how her chicken burger was overloaded with chicken. I would recommend a side of sweet potato fries and onion rings too. The coconut coleslaw was a nice addition, the peppers are grills perfectly and I honestly loved the flavour of the chicken. It is a different taste to Nandos. I like the overall atmosphere of restaurant.

The waitresses were so nice and when they found out it was my birthday and we had a cake, they really wanted to make a fuss and get candles and sing happy birthday. It was a really lovely gesture. I'll definitely be coming back!",May 2018,Cabana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d4565336-Reviews-Cabana-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Amazing surprise!,"I went with my dad who grew up listening to Motown and my baby brother who is currently a teenager (and didn't know what Motown was exactly). I myself am in my 20s and love Motown music but had no idea of the history and events behind it.

From start to end, it really captures your attention and transforms you back in time to when Motown started. The actors have a lot of passion and really love what they are doing. Their voices were so beautiful and the outfits and set was amazing! I initially bought 3 tickets right at the back but on the night we were upgraded to seat 2 rows begins the stalls.

My teenage brother really enjoyed it and we loved the inclusion they had with the audience. I didn't really expect much from the show but it is honestly, one of the best shoes in Theatres at the moment!",March 2018,Motown the Musical,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d10044996-Reviews-Motown_the_Musical-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
Hidden Gem,"I had wanted to try crystal since it had expanded into a bigger restaurant. I am a big fan of the other two big Turkish restaurants just a few doors down the road but thought I'd give Crystal a go on this particular night. The restaurant is conveniently located next to Wood Green station, the shopping mall and Vue.

When we arrived to the restaurant, we were seated quickly at a nice large table (there were 3 of us). I then noticed a different table next to a fish tank and asked of we could sit there and the waiter was great and let us. We were served complimentary salad, bread and sauces but weren't given little starter dishes which we had to ask for.

Our drinks came in a timely manner. Each drink cost nearly £2 which is pretty normal in London but I was surprised at the cost of Ribenna as a tiny carton with straw was £2 and I would have expected a little bottle. We ordered two Lamacun to share and they tasted great! I think they are definitely one of the best that I have tasted in London.

Our mains came all together and the waiter kindly took our starter dishes to clear the table.I ordered the mixed shish with rice. The portions were very generous and the both the chicken and lamb were cooked to perfection. I was particularly shocked with how perfect the lamb was (lamb was very tender)and the food was still very hot and fresh after being served. The rice tasted very nice and has a very homecooked vibe to it (it reminded me of one of my mums Turkish friends cooking). After the meal we also received complimentary Turkish tea and baklava.

The only issue I had was paying as I had to wait a little while to get someone to bring the card machine. However, the issue was sorted out quickly.

Overall, what I liked about Crystal is that it isn't too overfilled with customers so the noise level is not annoying. You can eat in peace, have great food and the restaurant looks very modern arty. I will definitely be returning!",May 2018,Crystal Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g12529169-d943781-Reviews-Crystal_Restaurant-Wood_Green_Haringey_Greater_London_England.html,"Wood Green, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Really nice meal,"I went for a quick catch up with some friends. Driving there and finding a parking spot on a bank holiday was pretty easy so no complaints. We gave the host our details and was seated within 10 mins of arriving (it felt like much less because we were too busy talking in the waiting area).

We ordered Lamacun and a full platter which was more than enough food for 3 of us. Before our mains we also we got bread, salad and cacik as well as a waitress taking our drinks order straight away.

The Lamacun was nice but didn't stand out to me. However, the lamb shish on the full platter was absolutely amazing! I think my friends noticed that I was basically trying to eat them all without being too greedy. The lamb was very tender and cooked to absolute perfection. The platter as a whole tastes nice and they really don't skimp on the meat and rice. The overall service of the restaurant is also very good. We even managed to take some food home as there was so much food. The next time I'm coming to this restaurant, I will definitely be ordering the lamb shish!",April 2018,Gokyuzu Chingford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g10283565-d8685586-Reviews-Gokyuzu_Chingford-Chingford_Waltham_Forest_Greater_London_England.html,"Chingford, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Cool first golfing experience,"If I'm honest, I've never really been interested in anything golf related so when my friends suggested it, I just went with the flow. Surprisingly, it was a lot of fun and I will definitely be going back to play some more games! We were able to order nachos and drinks too and the staff were really helpful when we chose to refund our second game and keep it as a game for next time on our cards. They also have heaters which is great as London has been freezing the past few months. I'm left handed and they have clubs for left handed people too. I'd definitely recommend it for all ages as it's just a fun day out but it can also get a bit competitive!

Decent at certain dishes,"So we went to this restaurant because we were walking past. The guys outside said we'd get our drinks on the house and 20% discount so we weren't gonna complain. The interior had quite dim lighting and the decor is decent (it's generally clean which is great)

We ordered mains and I couldn't complain about my dish. The poppadoms were nice, along with a sweet mint sauce. There were 5 of us and we all ordered a spectrum of dishes. The menu is very long (maybe a bit too long) but we all managed to find something we wanted to eat. We ordered: one chicken madras, one lamb rogan josh, one lamb curry (basic curry), one biriyani (which came with its own curry sauce) and chicken curry (basic curry). We also had a rice and naan each.

Positives: The rice, naans, chicken madras, lamb curry and chicken curry were nice. The rogan Josh could have been better if there were more pieces but in terms of flavour it was acceptable.

Negatives: My friend ordered the biriyani and it didn't go down well. We all tried it (and as an Asian person myself), I knew it was overcooked, soft and lacked basic flavour. The curry sauce on the side didn't save the biriyani.

For a cheap bite, I think it's fine. I'd recommend it for the chicken madras. With the 20% discount and drinks it came to a decent price which I personally think is what you should be paying for anyway - nothing more. The staff were nice as well.",February 2018,The Monsoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1550869-Reviews-The_Monsoon-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Amazing Experience,"So I reviewed this place about a year or two ago. Though I liked the food, the service wasn't the best.

So I was with a friend and we decided to give the restaurant another go. We sat on the 1st floor at the big window. Though it was raining, it was still a pleasent atmosphere as it was nice and warm inside. The waiters were very nice. The complimentary bread basket, salad and sauces was very good. We ordered Lamacun (I believe that's how it's spelt) and a platter for 2!

The platter for 2 was more like a platter for 4! There was so much variety. I tried a bit of everything and I loved the mix of flavours and the spectrum of different meat dishes infused into one platter. There were also two different types of rice and grilled onion and tomato to compliment. The food was very fresh, I could tell it had just come off of the grill. It was a bonanza of everything I love about Turkish food. We event had more than enough to split between ourselves and take home. The food made me even more excited to go to Turkey now! I will definitely be bringing my family here.

Loved every moment!,"First time in Kenya and it was great! The hotel was lovely, for the price, you get more than enough space and comfort. The hotel offers activities so kids stay entertained. They can help you to book a safari and tour of mombasa. The staff are absolutely lovely and the beach is AMAZING!! (watch out for the local vendors on the beach because they just want to rip you off)

We stayed there for 10 days and the food is very nice and varied. They have a stir fry and noodle lunch one afternoon which was very nice, bbq lunch and dinners. After dinner, they have entertainment and we got to see masai mara dance performance and various Kenyan dancing.

After a hard year of constantly working, it was the most amazing break filled with absolutely lovely people. I cannot wait to go back to Kenya

Italian McDonald's,"I've heard a lot about vapiano and honestly I was so excited to go!

When we first arrived, the waiter asked us to leave and wait outside for an hour until we get called. Its December and freezing, and all I wanted was warmth. Luckily, we didn't wait long cos all the people before us had decided to leave.

Half of us ordered pizza and half ordered pasta. The pizza came in 20 mins and for pasta we had to wait in the queue for 45mins and then wait for all of ours to be made and by the time we got to eat, half of us were done and we then had to eat our pasta at a different time.

In terms of flavour and taste, it is nice but the wait had made us soo frustrated. I wouldn't recommend it for pasta but I guess for a cheeky pizza, it's fine. The restaurant wants cut the number of waiters and make it a McDonald's system but wants to charge twice as much as McDonald's. Not great because I get more service in Nandos.

Amazing!!,"I've been wanting to go to see this for ages and honestly, it blew my mind! We sat at C14 abd C15 and got to see everything up close. Definitely worth the money (it might be too close for most people). The characters, costumes, stage decor, and music was amazing! The story wasn't strictly like the Disney movie, but it was great. The actors have such great personalities and the magic carpet scene was so wavey, it was like I was being hypnotised lol

I went with my teenage baby brother (a treat from his big sister) and he really enjoyed it. He wasn't very over enthusiastic beforehand but he appreciated the comedy and humour of the show as well as the costumes and characters. He didn't stop talking about it afterwards.

Curry for those not used to curry,"So I'm really trying not to knock Masala Zone but honestly I have to tell the truth! I went with my friends and we were mostly Asian (and those of us who aren't Asian, are really big curry eaters anyway) so our standards were gonna be on the high side. We'd heard such good things about the place so thought it would be perfect for everyone. I arrived late and managed to order in a timely manner and catch up with everyone. Out of everyone, I think I ordered the most as I wanted to try a bit of everything and I was honestly just sooo hungry.

The order took forever to arrive. Everyone who had ordered a long time before me had to wait extra long because I think they wanted to send it out at the same time as mine. What I didn't get was why they didn't push my order up the line instead of pushing 5 people's orders down the line. The restaurant wasn't even busy. There were a few couples here and there. We had gone after the lunchtime buzz.

Eventually the food arrived. My friends weren't happy with their biriyani as they claimed it had too many bits and nuts in it and picking them out was getting a little stressful with every spoon. (Don't get me wrong, I know it's essential to add them in for flavour but they didn't quite think about the end result for the customer)

I ordered a samosa, chicken Korma, white rice and naan. The naans are a great size and I was able to share with a friend. However, for £5 I was expecting more than one samosa. Two would have been nice for the price but instead I got a samosa and chick peas. I HATE CHICK PEAS. I know that they were trying to make the dish look more full but I didn't realise the chick peas would come with the samosa. Anyway, I gave it away to another friend as I didn't want it to go to waste.

The korma was fluorescent yellow and I remember when it arrived at the table, everyone just stopped and stared I honestly tried my hardest to defend the korma until the end but when I took a picture of it on my phone, all I saw was neon yellow. It was an average curry. More for those not used to eating the full on Indian flavours.

All in all the best, I did fill me up. I wouldn't bother with the samosa again...or try the biriyani. The curry was average but it wasn't the worst. I think I'd only go here if I was in the area and wanted something safe to eat.",August 2017,Masala Zone Islington,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d800495-Reviews-Masala_Zone_Islington-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Average burger place,"GBK is somewhere I have wanted to try for ages! My friends chose it and I just went with it. I ordered the Satay burger and I kind of wished I went for a normal chicken burger now. I think I was expecting too much as ""satay"" is something I was expecting more flavours from, like satay chicken but it was really plain. And on top of that when I was ordering my food I asked for onion rings but the cashier put it down as fries. Afterwards, I hadn't noticed as I was also speaking to my friends so when the order arrived, I was so confused as to why the waitress gave me fries. I told her it was wrong and another waiter explained that it had been put down wrong on the system and I needed to pay the outstanding balance so I could get onion rings. He said it wouldn't take long for the onion rings to arrive so I started on my burger. I took my sweet time with the burger and there was no sign of my onion rings. I asked after I had finished my burger, where the onion rings were and they said they would have to make them fresh as they did make it but no one dropped them off. At this point I was just relaxing with my friends, I didn't mind. I kind of just wanted a refund for them because I had already had the burger but I didn't want to make a fuss as I know they were on their way. Eventually, they arrived and the presentation was cute and they tasted nice. Only problem was is that my hunger had passed and I kind of had to force feed myself.

Overall, it's not a bad place to dine. I think I just had a bit of bad luck with this particular restaurant. Sadly, it's put me off a little bit from visiting again....or maybe for a little while...",October 2017,Gourmet Burger Kitchen (GBK),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g11963623-d3633418-Reviews-Gourmet_Burger_Kitchen_GBK-Stratford_City_Greater_London_England.html,"Stratford City, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Birthday Party for 15,"I decided that I would like to throw a birthday dinner with my friends and family. My friends are mainly non-asian so I thought it would be a great idea to throw my dinner at one of my favourite Indian restaurants. After speaking to a bunch of restaurants, I decided to go with Spice Village.

I have previously been here a few times whenever I've been in the Southall area and I've got to admit, I've never really been disappointed.

I spoke to the manager of the restaurant before hand in person and we organised the reservations and dishes which I would like to be served. He was very thorough and showed me the seating area which was great so there was no detail left unconfirmed.

A few of my guests cancelled and I spoke to the restaurant about making the reservation for a smaller number. The restaurant was very understanding and didn't cancel my reservation.

On the evening, the staff were great because my reservation was for 8:30pm and I could see them asking the previous customers to make that area free for my party. My guests started arriving and everyone really liked the decor and the VIP as it made the dinner party more intimate and it wasn't noisy.

I thought they would start serving food at around 9pm but food didn't arrive until 9:30ish and I think everyone was starving at that point. My friends really enjoyed the starters which was a mix of lamb rolls, chicken tikka, samosa, salad and a vegetarian dish for one of my vegetarian friends. Soft drinks were served too.

It was a long while until the mains came out afterwards but I didn't particularly mind. However, I guess no one wanted to get home too late as we had work in the morning as well. Previously, I had arranged for 4 curries to be served (a fourth curry was offered by the manager to be included in the set price) but the restaurant only served 3 of the curries. Chicken, lamb and vegetable. I wanted to speak to the manager about it but it looked like he wasn't in so I didn't want to ruin my happy mood. The waiters also made it really awkward when I asked for extra portions of rice for my guests. Like, I could hear that part of the restaurant get really silent and awkward so I just let it go and eventually the waiter got the hint and gave us the extra portions of rice I had ordered.

The food was amazing! Honestly, that is what I was looking forward to. Being with my close friends and family and having my favourite food. I am so particular with my Indian food restaurants and honestly, Spice Village is one of the best ones in London. I've had two birthday dinners here after discovering the restaurant a few years ago.

My friends and family said dessert was amazing. I was too full to try. The VIP area was also a great private area to cut my cake and sing happy birthday and take loads of pictures. Another waiter helped bring my cake out and gave us containers and bags for guests who wanted to take the dessert and cake home. He also played happy birthday on the restaurant stereo and it was really funny.

Overall, I can't complain about the whole experience. Everyone seemed really happy with the dinner party. There were a few things that could have been better in terms of main course but I guess I know what changes to make if I were to do this again. I hope if I were to host another dinner here in the future for the manager to be present so he can take charge of the situation rather than the staff be a bit lost about what my arrangements were.",May 2017,Spice Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1646066-d2015050-Reviews-Spice_Village-Southall_Ealing_Greater_London_England.html,"Southall, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great experience,"So it was my first visit to disneyland and I didn't have high hopes for the hotel because it was one of the cheaper Disneyland hotels. We decided to keep the holiday cheap and cheerful so we opted for this hotel anyway.

We were pleasantly surprised. Checking in was easy, the staff speak English and everything was throughly explained to us. A lovely staff member showed us to our rooms as the hotel is large and we got lost LOL

Our room was basic, bathroom was great. Cute mini Mickey mouse shower gels. I loved the cars theme, especially the mirror in the bathroom.

Its close to the park and the shuttles comes every 15 mins. It was too cold for us to walk.

Breakfast was great! I hate having food before I go on big rides in the morning but I could eat a croissant or two before heading off.

I would recommend this hotel to families, friends, couples who are on a budget. If I'm honest, we hardly spent any time in the hotel apart from snoozing and showering and spent a lot of time at the parks. Its great value for money!

Lovely,"This was my first time in Penang and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a last minute holiday and I didn't really think it was gonna be that great but surprisingly I really enjoyed it.

We flew from Kuala Lumpur in the morning and got to our hotel just after noon. Check-in was super easy and quick. Our rooms were ready so we went straight up. However, when we got to our room, the key card didn't work so I quickly rushed down to see what was wrong. The problem was sorted out within minutes and we were moved to another room.

The Room: The room was sooo spacious! I was sharing with my two younger brothers. Even with three luggages in the room, my brothers still had space on the floor to play and run around. We got a kingsize bed (my brothers shared) and a single so I had my own little corner of the room near the giant window. The bathroom was fine, I have no complaints.

Food: We went on a breakfast board basis. Breakfast was really nice. I usually don't eat an omelette for breakfast, but I couldn't resist. The chef made it to absolutely perfection! I don't even like mushrooms but he cooked it perfectly. There is a really nice range of food and juices at the buffet.

Layout: The hotel is divided into the tower and a smaller hotel on the beach, connected by a bridge that runs over the main road (saves the stress of crossing the busy road). The gym is in the tower. The restaurant, swimming pool and beach are within the smaller hotel. It didn't bother me that we were in the tower. It was really quiet and we could see the night market every night. Its really easy to get around the hotel.

Things to do: Even though we went in October, we were still able to go jetskiing, parasailing, and enjoy the sun. There is a tour bus that can take you to various tourist hotspots just outside the hotel (ask reception), the 101 bus from just outside the hotel takes you to Georgetown in approximately 40 mins (buses are easy to travel on and clean). The hotel helped us organise a private tour to Penang Hill, Temple, Mosque, Floating Mosque and other places. The night market is a great place for souvenirs, art, emergency clothes, AND FOOD!

Local food: Don't be afraid to try the food from Stalls, we used to sometimes eat out at Long Beach restaurant which was made up of loads of little stalls. U choose a table and one by one order your food. You pay when the food comes (in Malaysian money). McDonald's is down the road and there is a bank and a 711 opposite as well as many other restaurants.

Travelling with kids: Be super careful when walking around with kids down the road because the area around the night market doesn't have proper pavements. The drivers of cars, buses, and scooters on the road are generally quite careful but they may not see a person during night or driving quickly. BASICALLY JUST BE SUPER SAFE AND CAREFUL.

Totally want to go back next year for another break! I would definitely like to stay here again and I am definitely going to start staying at holiday inns while travelling to other destinations!

Thank you to everyone at the hotel!",October 2016,Holiday Inn Resort Penang,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635527-d304777-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Resort_Penang-Batu_Ferringhi_Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",hotels,5.0,4.0
LOOOVVEEE,"So everyone knows that I hate food from stalls and I am one of the world's pickiest eaters. I hate trying new foods and when my parents told me we were going to eat here, I froze.

The stalls offer such a big range of food. My parents ordered some satay chicken and beef, various curries (chicken jalfrezi + sweet and sour chicken), rice and drinks. My family tucked into the food and I gathered the courage to try the food. IT WAS THE BEST FOOD I'VE HAD IN SUCH A LONG TIME.

I basically spent quite a few evenings here and had dinner. Its not a place I would usually eat at (I saw videos of street fold on YouTube beforehand and instantly decided I wouldn't try any food from stalls) but I am so glad that I did try it!",October 2016,Long Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635527-d1772228-Reviews-Long_Beach-Batu_Ferringhi_Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice,"The hotel has a pleasant atmosphere. You can see the Petronas towers from the hotel. Staff are very helpful and polite. They helped give us directions and travel information which we really appreciated as this was our first time in the city.

The hotel is in a good location. The Petronas towers are only a short walk away along with the shopping mall and food court via a bridge. We were able to walk back and forth really easily and safely (even during late night hours). There is also a metro station across the road and we were able to see the Batu Caves using it. It was a lot of fun to go wondering around.

The rooms were nice and spacious during our stay. The bathrooms need a little bit more improvement as the water pipe in the bath wasn't functioning, the toilet didn't flush properly and the shower only sprayed water on full blast which felt a bit too rough.

Breakfast was nice. The staff are really focused on providing a great service.

Overall, I'd stay here again because of the great staff and hotel location. If someone could look into the bathrooms and get them up to a higher standard, that would be great!",October 2016,Hotel Istana Kuala Lumpur City Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298570-d301004-Reviews-Hotel_Istana_Kuala_Lumpur_City_Centre-Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",hotels,4.0,4.0
Really good!,"So I come from an Indian background and I'd say that the food here is really good! We literally could not decide what to eat so I decided to place it safe and go Indian. However, I'm really picky with Indian restaurants so I was still worried cos most restaurants just serve bowls of grease with no flavour.

We got the meat platter, pilau rice, and samosas. I kinda underestimated how much food we ordered and I loved the food so much. Between two people, it was more than enough food! I'd definitely recommend it! :)",September 2016,Indi-Go Street Food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d7359269-Reviews-Indi_Go_Street_Food-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.0
Surprisingly good!,"So this restaurant was chosen by one of my friends as the location for another's friends leaving party.

It's about a 10 min walk from Hammersmith station and it's easy to spot.

Arrival: When I arrived at the restaurant, no one greeted me or showed me to the table which my friends were already at. I decided to just walk through and no one stopped me or said anything.

Ordering: Quick and easy. I've never had Persian food at a restaurant before so I just let my friends decide what we were getting.

Drinks: Drinks arrived on time.

Meal: Starters was surprisingly really nice. We had this egg/chicken salad thing with naan and I was really surprised that I liked it. Between 7 of us, we had 2 platters (for two) and it was more than enough food for us all. Im used to more Indian spices but the food had a really nice flavour. The meat, chicken and rice with cranberry, all complimented each other nicely. The two sauces were a great addition too.

Payment: They do charge service charge. The price was very affordable for the food they were offering.

Would I go again? Yes, ofcourse.",August 2016,Mahdi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d951192-Reviews-Mahdi-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Milkshake was better than the burger,"I'm such a big fan of beef burgers and I was really looking forward to trying out this place. The prices are decent for what they offer but I know there are cheaper options in London that taste better. However, it is baker st so I'll let that go. The restaurant is very hipster and cool. Really glad they offer halal food.

Waiting time for orders isn't long and the Oreo milkshake was surprisingly really good! The burger however was really strange, I had the Mexicali and it gave me a tummy ache. Something about the beef and sauce was really sickly. I thought I was going to be sick in the restaurant but I managed to get home in one piece. For a Saturday evening, it wasn't too busy which was ideal for me and my friends to have a catch-up

I don't think I will be returning anytime soon but it wasn't all bad I guess!",April 2016,Siirgista Bros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d9853378-Reviews-Siirgista_Bros-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Definitely going back!!,"We all really enjoyed our stay at the resort. I got my peace and quiet at the private beach. My parents got to hang out at the bar and enjoy the cuisine, and my brothers were able to play all the tennis and chess they wanted to.

This hotel was basically a home away from home for us except there was a beach near by (unlike the busy city of London :P)

We had two family suites which was great because we had lots of space. Only one swimming pool was open during our stay and we were hoping one of the bigger pools would have been open but I can't complain at all because I was still able to swim lengths.

The food was up to a good standard. Drinks were good. The waiting staff were good too. One waiter in particular was fantastic in that he knew which drinks we were going to order so we didn't have to keep on repeating it over and over again.

The young man at the reception was absolutely amazing and so was the young lady (Kimberley). Anytime we needed help, I could always rely on them both to answer my questions or offer to help out.

One tiny little thing that bugged me is the view of the metal frameworks of the old piers on the private beach. The beach itself is fabulous. The water is nice and clear and there is a mix of sand and stones on the beach but it's lovely to walk on. However, the view of the old piers bugged me a little because it distracted from the beautiful scenery of the beach and mountains in my photographs.

The resort is quite a distance away from main antalya town. We got the bus there but improvised on our way back by taking the tram and bus back to the resort or various buses (taxi is easier (but a lot more expensive) and we wanted more of an adventure). Kemer is easier to get to and back from but it personally didn't float my boat. In Antalya, there is a really nice mall called Markantalya which has loads of well known shops like mango, H&M etc which I would recommend going to if you are a shopaholic like me.

The people of Antalya are really lovely. We got lost on one of our evenings out in Antalya and the people helped get us directions and put us on the right bus back to the resort. One of the bus drivers even drove us to the right bus stop for us to get another bus back to the resort and didn't charge us.

I am thinking about returning to resort later on in the year with friends because I had such a great time. I hope you guys keep up the standards :)

Thank you!! :D",March 2016,Paloma Foresta Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g678226-d296189-Reviews-Paloma_Foresta_Resort-Beldibi_Kemer_Turkish_Mediterranean_Coast.html,"Beldibi, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5
Love it,"So, I'm super picky with my food and I really dislike eating beef but the beef burgers here are really good! I've only been a few times and they never disappoint.

Service-wise: The staff are really nice but sometimes I feel like they are really rushed off their feet for such a small restaurant. Getting our order taken took a little too long but the wait for the food isn't long at all which is great because we had been to an event earlier and we were starving. Overall, service is acceptable.

Drinks-wise: I really like the mocktails. I wouldn't really recommend the Milkshakes just because I have tried better but it could just be to do with my personal preference.

Food-wise: The burgers taste just as good as they look. Great presentation. The burger fillings all compliment one another and the drinks. You get a really filling meal from just the burger itself and the sides are great if you want to share with one or two people. I always get the breakfast brunch burger (don't know the exact name) but it's really good.

When it came to grabbing the bill, it took a while just because they were really busy (Friday night and all) so we just went up to the reception and paid there as we were in a rush ourself. The waiter who was doing our payment was really nice and answered my questions about writing a review for this place.

Had a wonderful evening. Thanks guys! :)",February 2016,The Gourmet Hut,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d8026770-Reviews-The_Gourmet_Hut-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Terrible treatment,"So we went to Dawat because it looked nice and new. I had heard amazing reviews from my friends and thought I'd give it a go with my family.

We all work really hard for our jobs and education and this is our social time together.

We were seated in a really nice corner of the restaurant and given the menus. We were happy.

HOLD UP! The prices advertised in the restaurant and the menu were completely different. I felt like this was a case of false advertisement but I wasn't going to argue over a difference of £10-£20(though some people do find that a lot of money)

Soon after we ordered, the drinks came quickly. Along with sauce and salad which any other restaurant gives.

Now, this is when the problem starts. There was a big group of people having dinner adjacent to us. They were noisy but I didn't mind because it's the weekend and everyone is relaxing.

We sat at the table for approximately 30mins waiting for food. It was a really long wait for curry. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very uncomfortable towards us because we were the only non-urdu speaking table.

SO! A waiter comes up to our table and asked us to move. We were polite and agreed.

The waiter told us we had no choice but to sit next to the door/entrance. It's winter and we could feel the evening wind from the corner that we were previously sat at.

We asked if we could could wait for another table as we didn't want to sit next to the door. The waiter refused and was really rude about it.

So my dad said he wanted to wait for the next table and I tried to calm down my family but the waiter was really rude to me by telling me to sit down as if I was some sort of child. Furthermore, he was rude to my mother and that is a big no no.

I didn't want to start a bigger fight than the current argument.

We were treated badly and we didn't do anything wrong.

I guess the only bad thing we did make was choosing a terrible restaurant to eat at.

We walked out and went to our usual Pakistani/Indian restaurant down the road.",January 2016,Dawat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1646066-d8606786-Reviews-Dawat-Southall_Ealing_Greater_London_England.html,"Southall, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Better than expected,"Service was good. Food was good overall. The curry's lack a bit of meat in them (please look into this) but the mixed grill is amazing and such great value for money.

Staff are friendly and helpful. Overall price was decent. Will be returning.",November 2015,Chaudhry's TKC Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1646066-d1947762-Reviews-Chaudhry_s_TKC_Restaurant-Southall_Ealing_Greater_London_England.html,"Southall, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Really good dessert menu!,I went with my brothers. We go to tinsel town every few months. We enjoy the food but we always look forward having a milkshake or dessert. Sometimes that's all we have. The chocolate cake with ice cream is amazing! We have a chocolate overload and then we can't eat chocolate for a week afterwards. It only costs £5 each so it's a great way of keeping my younger brother happy and it definitely fills everyone up. The atmosphere is really nice and modern and clean. The staff are helpful and waiting time isn't bad at all.,October 2015,Tinseltown Wood Green,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d4237202-Reviews-Tinseltown_Wood_Green-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,2.5
Really bad,"The place looks okay. I went with friends. The drink prices were okay but we could see the rubicon bottles that they were being poured from.

I ordered a chicken steak with fries. Not very good! I was served a small steak with large fries. The spices on the steak weren't a very good combination, like they had been thrown together in a rush.

Service was pretty bad. We ended up being alone in the restaurant for a long time so couldn't order more drinks and the staff have a bit of an attitude.

Not the worst place I've been to but I definitely would not recommend it to a friend.",October 2015,Steakout,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2621771-Reviews-Steakout-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,3.0

"Great food, terrible service","Okay so I've heard great things but this place but sadly when I went my experience wasn't very good. I went with a few friends that I haven't seen in ages and i thought it would be a great place to catch up and all. The restaurant was nice and busy and we were sat at a table upstairs. I like the simple decor and the place looks really neat.

So it took us forever to order. I was fasting so I timed it so by the time we ordered, the food would be with us by the time I have to break fast but that wasn't the case. We ordered just before I was about to break my fast but whoever took our order gave us a bread basket and dip which was great cos I was a little hungry. The drinks came in less than five minutes which was fine cos I was thirsty as hell so I can't complain about that.

The food took forever to come but I didn't mind because I was too busy talking to my friends. However, another one of our friends was running late and she had already told us what to order her so we ordered for her so by the time she got here she would already have the food and drink. It took us forever to get the attention of a waiter so we could order for her. If was bad enough getting attention for our own orders the first time but the second time around but terrible. No one was paying attention to the customers. Instead everyone was huddled up in one spot.

Then we realised that we didn't get a salad like everyone else so my friend asked politely and the guy was very responsive after we got his attention after he spoke to another table and told one of the other waiters. The salad got delivered to my friend after a few mins.

So we are eating, my friend arrives, she is still waiting for her food 30 mins after arriving even though we ordered long before she came. We had to remind a waiter to check on her order cos we were nearly finished and the woman was really nice about it and it did come in about 5-10 mins.

The rest of the meal was great. The food was great. I can't complain about the food at all. I was continuously ordering coke throughout the service and the waiter was great cos I didn't have to wait long.

I would definitely recommend this place and I probs will go again for a meet up but the service could have been better. However, I do know how hard it can be to work in hospitality so I'll let it slide. It wasn't a biggy. I just wanted to tell everyone about my experience.",July 2015,Kervan Sofrasi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d6200952-Reviews-Kervan_Sofrasi-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Good Indian Food/ Weird Service,"It was our second visit and we enjoyed it again. Only thing was, it was busy and the host took us to a table that was still in the process of being cleaned so we had to wait as a family in the middle of people eating and it got a bit awkward. Maybe if the waiter and host communicated there wouldn't have been five people plus staff just standing there watching a waiter clean.

However, THE FOOD IS SO GOOD! I am from all over The Indian subcontinent so I've tried nearly all the various types of foods. I would say this is one of the better places in London (even though it's on the outskirts). My family are particularly picky with what they eat as we are used to high quality chicken and lamb. The portions are good, and there were good pieces of meat. For five people, we ordered four different currys and rice and a few naans for the child in our group.

Towards the end of our meal we wanted to order a few more naans for my father and brother so we asked a guy who looked like a waiter. He told us to ask a waiter and he stood there organising some spoons. So we looked around and there was no one, so we asked him politely to just bring them from the kitchen but he insisted he couldn't but when we saw a waiter, the guy just yelled it across the restaurant and got back to what he was doing.

I've worked in high end hospitality as a student and if a customer wants something, no matter who you are in the restaurant, you go and get it or tell someone who can get it or ask kitchen, add it to the bill, wash your hands and bring in to the customer. But in that time I felt like the curry was getting cold and we had to wait for a missing waiter.

All in all, the food was great. Servers probably need to be reminded that it's team work rather than I'll do my own job.

It hasn't put me off coming to the restaurant though. The prices are a bit higher than the other restaurants but worth it once in a while. :)",July 2015,Spice Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1646066-d2015050-Reviews-Spice_Village-Southall_Ealing_Greater_London_England.html,"Southall, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Better than I expected!! :D,"So let's get down to business, this isn't dubai and it's nothing like it. It's not artificial but they try to make the effort. The staff are cool and check in was fine. THe keys are like house keys which I didn't quite like at first but you just get over it in like two minutes. The rooms were clean.

I was actually quite worried because when I booked the holiday for the family it was 3* and we had never been to anywhere lower than 4* so everyone was complaining at first. HOWEVER, once we got there everyone could see it was fine and spending a week there didn't seem so bad.

We went with Thomas Cook and the rep is great. He booked two excursions for us and in total we spent about £400 approx for five of us (two day trips). They went perfectly fine! Really fun and treated well.

There is also another guy at the hotel who sits around and tries to sell you excursions. Don't fall for it! We went quad biking and it was about £100 that we spent and we went around a dirt farm on some old quads. Literally felt like he took us around to his farm to quad bike. However, putting that aside, we didn't really care and embraced the adventure. We also booked a pirate ship adventure and were promised the chance to see dolphins and the kids could do some fishing. No dolphins and fishing was -> piece of square wood with a bit of string. Food wasn't good either.

Back to the hotel!
Food is fine. We had one child in our group and he ate just fine. Pizza and pasta/spag Bol is served pretty much everyday so even if there isn't something amazing u like, there are just some basics to get you through because let's face it - you can only eat so much. Tunisian dishes should be tried by everyone cos it's just common sense, don't avoid it, you'd be surprised how much you might like it.
The only thing that irritated me was that there weren't enough waiters/ floor staff at the restaurant to help serve and clean tables. But if you ask, they help very quickly.

I'm pretty sure I didn't meet anyone who complained about the hotel but I generally avoid unhappy people.

The staff opened up the indoor pool during our stay because the outdoor pool was way too cold and when I went for a swim it felt like I had gone to Antarctica in the outdoor pool. But the indoor ones were great! I was really happy with the staff listening to the guests at the hotel.

Rooms were fine. Food was okay. View from window was great. Indoor pools were great. Staff were great. Thomas Cook excursions were good. Beach was good.

We had a discussion as a family after the holiday and we all agreed that for a fifth of what we normally spend on a holiday, we got a lot out of it and we will be doing it again very soon. It was pretty much value for money!!!!",April 2015,El Ksar Resort & Thalasso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295401-d316787-Reviews-El_Ksar_Resort_Thalasso-Sousse_Sousse_Governorate.html,"Sousse, Tunisia",hotels,3.0,3.5
We loved it!,"My family and I stayed here for 6 nights. After spending a few days in busy Bangkok, it was great to finally have some peace and quiet in Phuket. The beach is only 10 minutes walk and they have a great variety of restaurants and shops nearby (Ying's restaurant was our faviourite). The staff were great and really friendly. Though we didn't get rooms next to each other, we preferred it because we (the teenagers) could party and have fun while our parents were on the floor below relaxing.

The kids pool is great if you just want to go joke around and play water games. The slide is fun too :P even adults can use it! They also have a bar where parents can chill while their kids have fun and you can buy ice-cream there too! The adult pool is a lot more chilled and has a cool bar too! You can actually swim in the pool since there aren't any kids.

We stayed in two of the superior rooms which was great value for money considering we booked last minute. Though we did experience a leak on the first day, the maintenance guys quickly sorted it out. We also had breakfast at the hotel every morning which was nice cos it saved us the stress of finding somewhere else to eat. They have a wide variety of food and we really liked it. Room service was great as well and well prices. After going snorkelling and canoeing, it was great to have some tasty pizza in our rooms after a clean shower. Wifi was free but it was the basic type :) can't complain cos everything loaded quite quickly.

Things to do in Phuket definitely include going to the Phi Phi Islands tour and the James Bond Island tour. Patong is a cool place to go if you wanna chill at another beach and Jungceylon (The Mall). Taxi from the hotel is about 500bhatt to Patong or 400bhatt by Tuk Tuk but the ride is really fun since your going up and down hills. The Monkey Show and Elephant trekking is also a must!

Go to the beach in the morning at around 9am. 11am is when the best waves hit! :D The evening is more calm and its great to watch the sunset.",June 2014,Centara Karon Resort Phuket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1215780-d609715-Reviews-Centara_Karon_Resort_Phuket-Karon_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",hotels,4.0,4.5
The best food in Phuket!,"So we are a family of five who like all different types of food. The staff were really friendly and we found out the chicken at the restaurant is halal (we trusted them cos they told us they are also muslim).
I went for the Thai green curry and chicken friend rice which tasted amazing and was so filling! I wasn't really a fan of Thai food but the restaurant definately changed my opinion and now I love it!
My brother and parents went for the fried fish and rice which was absolute value for money cos the fish was massive! They loved it so much!
My youngest brother went for a margaritas pizza since that's the only thing he practically eats!
