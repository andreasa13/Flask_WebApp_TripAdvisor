Definitely check this out,"From all over Athens, you can see the Acropolis. It is worth the trip to see the famous monument/archaeological site in person. Even if you are not a history buff, learning about Ancient Greece is interesting.

The hike up is a little strenuous but not too bad. I saw a lot of elderly people walking up.

There are signs that explain the history of all the different buildings but having a tour guide helps.

If you are going off season, no need to buy the ""skip the line"" ticket because there is probably not that much of a wait. Also, from November -March, the regular ticket price is reduced to 10Euros.",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Basic tour, okay if you don’t want to worry about transportation","Tour was super basic. And I’m using the “tour” loosely. You are paying for a taxi driver to take you around to popular tourist sites. You still have to pay to see everything.

Our guide was nice bit he didn’t speak a lot of English. I guess they don’t want you asking the driver any questions, lest you think he’s a tour guide. You pay extra for a tour guide.

He picked us up at our downtown hotel and took us to as much as he could in 4 hours but traffic was a little crazy.

All things considered, if you want to visit sites and have someone else worry about the transportation, this tour is for you. Other than that, I would suggest you pick something else.",November 2019,Athens Half Day Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d17349931-Athens_Half_Day_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,3.0,4.5
Great hotel for business travellers,"I had a trip to Alpharetta and chose this hotel because I like Hilton hotels.

The rooms were nice. The air conditioner worked so well I had to turn it off because I got cold.That is saying something because this Georgia heat does not play!

Every afternoon, I made sure to get an apple-cranberry oatmeal cookie.

The hotel was in a great location. There are a lot of restaurants close by on the main road. Another plus was that there was public transport in front of the hotel.

I especially appreciated the helpful staff at breakfast.There was a woman who helped me get my to-go box and even helped me carry my stuff to my car when I needed it.

All and all, it was a good visit.",August 2019,Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta North/Alpharetta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29196-d89267-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Atlanta_North_Alpharetta-Alpharetta_Georgia.html,"Alpharetta, Georgia",hotels,4.0,4.5
