Lunch - Fish Goan curry (without fish),"Went to lunch - beautiful day and splendid views.
Food was average but rather pricy, guess you pay for the decor.
Ordered the Goan Fish curry on the 3 set menu. The curry was fine but there was no fish- lots of calamari rings and a few prawns. Apparently that’s what you get when I enquired. I think this is very misleading. Sea food Goan curry would be more appropriate. I don’t think anyone would be impressed if they ordered fish and chips, and there was no fish!",January 2020,The Headland Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186239-d191645-Reviews-The_Headland_Hotel_Spa-Newquay_Cornwall_England.html,"Newquay, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.5
Very nice pasta,We ordered 2 pasta for take out. Service very good and fast. Pasta was very fresh and well made. Better than home made. I don’t think you will be disappointed. 11 Euros each and very good portion.,April 2019,La Pasteria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g562630-d781906-Reviews-La_Pasteria-Glyfada_Attica.html,"Glyfada, Greece",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Nice views from the top.,"Visited mid April 19. Temperature mid teens, so pleasant to walk. Queue to buy tickets long and slow. Try buy tickets at another ( less busy attraction) children under 18 free but make sure you have ID. Even if they look like 10 years old, they won’t accept or use any logic. Eating not allowed. Make sure you have water to rehydrate. There is no food, drink or toilet facilities once you have walked through the gates. Steps can be slippery. Health and safety appears to be non existed in Athens, so take appropriate precautions.

Oily food,Ordered a couple of take-aways. Prices very reasonable. But food was drowned in oil. Service was good and quick.,April 2019,Indian Masala,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1875088-Reviews-Indian_Masala-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Excellent service and beautiful beach,"We came for a day and had lunch with relatives. The staff were excellent and very welcoming. The chef prepared us our favourite meal. No hassle.
Mr Vik the ‘sea urchin master’ made us feel at home.
Would highly recommend.",July 2018,LUX Le Morne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g488105-d316737-Reviews-LUX_Le_Morne-Le_Morne.html,Mauritius,hotels,5.0,5.0
