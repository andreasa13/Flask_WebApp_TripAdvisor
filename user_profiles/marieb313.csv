Best restaurant in that area,"The staff was very welcoming and polite. The food was very fresh, I had the salmon and vegetables - and the little extras given to the customer, i.e. olive tapenade, beetroot compound, bread, free small dessert, tiramisu and profiterole and the free small potato and leek soup made us came up. We ate there twice. Maybe it was because of the Corona Virus, but our service was excellent and the prices are reasonable.

Highly recommend,"The hotel is in a somewhat remote location, yet quiet neighborhood, so this could be a plus or not for some people. BTW highly recommend the restaurant OROSCOPE, right around the corner, to eat!

The check-in was great. Angeliniki (not sure about the spelling) was very welcoming and upgraded us to a suite, I think we had a standard room. The suite was a lovely room, but I would like to say, I am wondering how small or not so lovely the room was we reserved, as the upgraded room represents normal standards we are used to. So, if you book a ""standard"" room, you might be disappointed.
So, that said, the room was great, a bit small, but everything was at our fingertips. We did not order daily breakfast at the hotel, as 30 Euros is just too much and almost just arrogantly too expensive!
I did however order in room service - which was lovely, not always consistent, yet much more affordable for 18 Euros. For instance I ordered decaf coffee for 6 Euros - got a pot of hot water and 3 Nescafe sticks -- I called the room service and explained that 3 sticks of Nescafe dried coffee were not what I had in mind when I wanted coffee. The correct terminology would be FILTERED coffee, and it was brought to me immediately, and it was very good coffee!!!

The front desk personnel, is top notch at this facility! They were SUPER HELPFUL, and that is one of the reasons I would book again at the hotel. The hotel was very clean, and check-out was ok. Haven't reviewed my final bill yet, but I am assuming everything is ok. The staff was honest, polite and helpful. Don't hesitate to book with this particular property.",March 2020,Divani Caravel Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d230392-Reviews-Divani_Caravel_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent,"All the food choices were excellent, service is excellent, and YES you do pay for all of that, but oh so worth it!",August 2019,Flight Restaurant and Wine Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55197-d1409484-Reviews-Flight_Restaurant_and_Wine_Bar-Memphis_Tennessee.html,"Memphis, Tennessee",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Don't understand the good reviews,"We ate there August 15, 2019. The reservation process was very pleasant. Once we got there, we were seated right away. So far, so good. The decor, oh gosh, there is paint peeling from the ceiling, will it end up in your drink or food? The table setting was dated, ca 1970s. Pleather brown tablerunners, that looked dated were placed over white table cloth, why bother? The pleather tablecloth was unappealing, dated and nasty looking. The menu, yawn... The flatware was cheap, water spots, and old and needs to be replaced.
The wine list, a $10.00 bottle of wine from Kroger was cheerfully sold at $25.00 - no thought provoking matchings with the food.
The food, well it was ok I had a very expensiv prime rib that was pretty salty, just ok, and the caramalized onions over the potatoes were sickingly sweet. The pork chop was good, the sea scallops so salty we couldn't finish them. The waiter was underwhelming, no charm, no up selling, did not make us welcome, no selling the menu, did not check back to see if it was good, MEDIOCRE at BEST. We ran out and went and had a wonderful desert at Flight.
I went there based on reviews. It wasn't horrible, but for $156.00 I expect everything to be wonderful, this was not, please don't go there. I recommend Flight hands down. It is time that McEwens, does a good clean, new deco, fixes their paint, updates the menu, and gets a better wine list and waiters that care. For that money. Had it been $60.00 I would give it great reviews... NOt worth it.",August 2019,McEwen's On Monroe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55197-d338214-Reviews-McEwen_s_On_Monroe-Memphis_Tennessee.html,"Memphis, Tennessee",restaurants,2.0,4.5
"If you like sleeping in wet sheets, go for it","I booked the Nottoway Plantation and Resort based on great reviews. It is in the middle of NOWHERE, so if you are expecting a bit of night life, or entertainment or shopping, NOPE, this is NOT for you. For a wedding, where you will undoubtedly provide your own entertainment, it is a good venue. If you are NOT in a wedding party, it is very very very boring. But that set aside, the venue is romantic and it has an interesting history. We stayed in the Garden Cottages. The first thing that hit us, what the STINK, the smelly room. It smelt old, musty, and not aired, and just musty, and it was offensive. The air conditioning unit could not keep up with the 91 degree weather, it was muggy in the room. So muggy, and humid, that our pamphlets were limb from being wet, and the sheets were wet, I have never slept so uncomfortable, wet, humid and in a world of stink than those nights. The rooms were clean, but very very dated. No, not antique dated, but the linens could have used an update, the bathroom curtain shower was in need of update and, oh btw, no pressure in the shower, if you are ok with running all day around with shampoo left in our hair, than this is your place. The grounds are kept up nicely, HOWEVER, details, details... front doors, or bedroom doors have not been painted in a decade, fingerprints and smudges everywhere. Breakfast MEDIOCRE at best, the usual, eggs (cold btw), pastries, some old and tired looking fruit, staff that really doesn't want to be there, it was mediocre.
The highlight of the stay was the evening dinner, very salty, but we lived through it, their menu was nice, expensive, but it was nice and our server was very accommodating and nice.
This is not a fancy venue, this is Louisiana in the bundocks, and no class whatsoever. The mansion tour, if your tour guide shows up, ours did not - could have been interesting. We observed one of the cleaning ladies take an old, nasty broom and bang an wonderful antique around with it, to chase of the dust. Yep, that is as classy as it gets. Wont' be back and I would NOT recommend staying there.",July 2019,Nottoway Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g40491-d1544928-Reviews-Nottoway_Resort-White_Castle_Louisiana.html,"White Castle, Louisiana",hotels,2.0,4.5
"We had a great time, but I Did NOT learn anything new","We took the Farm to Table class today, 7/27/2019. Nothing special. I know how to cook daily food, but was expecting to come home with some more refined recipes, tips and techniques. The class was ok, the teacher was laid back, but I did not learn anything, and the food was ok. They should teach ADVANCED classes, this was a waste of my money and time. Sur La Table does a bit better job.",July 2019,Viking Cooking School,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g43799-d2178485-Reviews-Viking_Cooking_School-Greenwood_Mississippi.html,"Greenwood, Mississippi",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Oh no, run","If there were minus stars, I would love to give them. I did talk to the manager last night, and told her I would post this review. Never having been there, and wanting to support the hotel we were staying at, the Alluvian, we thought, great let's do the local restaurant, as it had great reviews. Well, I have eaten better at Wendy's.
The hostess. Not very welcoming, rather, "" sigh"", we are fully booked on the closed partitions (what is that?), you will have to eat on an open table? (as opposed to?) Not having a clue, we said, sure we eat at an open table. She then proceeded to slam the menus on top of each other, very professional, making us feel ever so cherished. Guided us to our table, and we waited, and waited...I guess OPEN TABLE means, you are the least welcome customer and you will wait for your server, for our horrible food, and you will wait some more.
Finally, Jasmine came. Didn't ask if it was our first time, if we had any preferences, nope... Didn't welcome us either. Sigh... Let the waiting begin. After we got our menus, we ordered our food. Asking Jasmine questions about the food was a mission to Mars, basically non existing. The girl had no clue why she was there, and what the menu entailed. She did mention a special, but that was about all the conversation we got out of her. To make this a short review, I am going to sum up what we complained to the manager about. A) Service and welcoming non existent and horrible. Jasmine was poorly if at all trained, if she was, well, she needs to switch jobs, she clearly hates her job. The shrimp in bourbon sauce were so salty and drenched in a ""Knorr"" or ""Maggi"" like marinade, we had to sent the dish back, the salt is still in my teeth. The arancini with lamb, lamb hardly there, were overcooked, and the marinara sauce was super bitter, some herb had been cooked to death. The flounder at a whopping $28 was very salty and the Polenta (drumroll) was actually good. The bread pudding was ok. The cocktail was ok, and the wine, well you would needed a lot of it, to wash the food down. The manager seemed to be concerned about our problems with the food, but Jasmine turned out to get even with us, we couldn't get the water refilled, it took us about 15 -20 min to get her attention. She just snobbed us. B) Quality of food was mediocre, the techniques used were not properly followed and everything was so SALTY it was disgusting. C) They comped our dessert and half of the arancini, which was great, but it wasn't enough, not to write this review. There is no attention to detail, no customer service, you are just a number, the food is not good and the presentation is just blah, no imagination for the money you have to pay. Our bill was for over $135, I have to work 2 days for that. I would never go back, nor recommend this restaurant to my friends. Please save your money and stay and go somewhere else. I don't like being taking advantage of.

Yet, the normal night noises of guests above you going to the bathroom are so loud, I couldn't sleep. Wont' go back for that.

Breakfast was ok -- every day the same - and if you stay for a few days, it gets old, but it was good.

"RUN, don't eat RUN","Oh gosh, worst food ever!!!!!! The restaurant is not clean and looks dated. Upon walking in the glass door was covered in fingerprints, smudges etc... I thought, gosh, if the food is that way, well ""good night"".
The waitress was something else. It took forever, dishes and glasses are old. I ordered the tuna, which was bad and overcooked. The waitress saw it immediately and took it back, I ordered a burger. It was dried out, french fries were cooked in old, old, old oil. OH YUK, my husband had some fish, and it was previously frozen. Just gross. The best was, as my husband tipped the waitress, he always carries $2.00 bills with him, she asked if they came from the strip club? WHAT??? - she said there where she usually gets them.

The gnocchis were really really good,"Went there because of the Tripadvisor ratings. Good choice! We did not have reservations, but we got there at 5:30 pm. They served us - later on we noticed that they turned lots of folks down as they did not have reservations. It's a bit pricey, the waiters are not very knowledgeable and definitely not trained in Italian cuisine. Proper etiquette for serving is a foreign concept. The owner of the restaurant sits at a table and watches everything that's going on. It gave me an uneasy feel, as that probably attributes to his success, but he wasn't very friendly, did not greet the guests, and it felt somewhat awkward, i.e. if he wasn't there, was the staff going to work or not?
Food was good, atmosphere ok, overall feel, a bit awkward.",April 2017,Benito One,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d424340-Reviews-Benito_One-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Do not recommend,"The restaurant itself looks very inviting and charming. Tastefully decorated and very comfortable atmosphere. We ate there tonight and I have to say, I won't be back. Our waitress FINALLY approached our table, after we had been seated, that took 8 minutes. (not good in the industry). I never knew her name, nor was she making us welcome. She wasn't unfriendly, she wasn't welcoming - we were just there. We ordered some wine, which took 12 minutes to get to the table - another ""no-no"" in the industry.

The tomato/chili soup came in an extremely tiny ramekin, which while transported to our table, overflowed and was extremely messy - NO ATTENTION to detail -- Soup was o.k. Popovers too sweet, but ok. The special we wanted to order which was the Grouper was already SOLD out at 6:30 pm. The waitress did not know her menu, nor did she know how to sell the menu. Ginger salmon - DRIED out, overcooked - common' people - for that kind of money, it should have been succulent. My duck was o.k, however the risotto was made with ordinary rice, not Arborio rice, it wasn't cooked right either. It was overcooked and under seasoned. The demi glace was acceptable. Why have an Italian rice dish in a French restaurant?? The steak wasn't cooked correctly and very tiny, the grouper was minuscule and overcooked.

Overall the dishes were OK, but nothing memorable was served. Dessert was blah, unimaginative and dated from the 80's . Key Lime pie was made with cheap condensed milk and was just not good. Service was o.k, tables too close together, you can overhear other peoples discussions, bathrooms were impeccable. Overall, would NOT recommend, would not go back.

I sure hope I can stay there in the next few years, and I hope if Madame Danen (sorry if I misspelled the name) reads this post, she will still welcome me as a guest. Thank you Madame Jolanda!
