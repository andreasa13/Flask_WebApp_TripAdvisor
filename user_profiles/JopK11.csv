Loved it,"How many restaurants can you find right next to the sea? And how many of those offer great hospitality and food? Thalassaki is amazing. Uncommon flavours enhanced with Greek herbs will excite you.
Tip: ask what herbs are used for each dish. Some might not be your cup of tea.",August 2016,To Thalassaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503711-d1027264-Reviews-To_Thalassaki-Tinos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Tinos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Best room ever?,"I was there a few months back and still, just thinking of the amazing room on the top floors I stayed in puts a huge smile on my face. The well-thought layout, the huge space of it, the colour palette, the quality of everything in there, the massive comfy bedddd, the super equipped bathroom, the views. Everything was just perfect. I'd say top 3 rooms I've ever stayed in!!!
The service of the hotel was a five star service and by service I mean real authentic Vietnamese style service from the heart.
Thank you!",May 2016,Hotel Nikko Saigon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293925-d2244762-Reviews-Hotel_Nikko_Saigon-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",hotels,5.0,4.5
Nature at its best,"Nothing man-made will ever beat the beauty of this (and millions more) unique wonder created by Nature. Absolutely breathtaking. I could spend hours in there.
If you are lucky enough to be visiting the amazing island of Kefalonia during the non peak-season, you will avoid the hundreds of daily visitors and the longs queues for Melissani, plus you'll get to spend much more time in the lake on the lovely boats.
Suggestions:
1. Try to make it there at noon. The sunbeams will through a magic show for you in the lake.
2. If you can't stand queue or do not fancy this type of attractions, then I'd suggest a pass on this.",August 2016,Melissani Cave,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g8281993-d1142674-Reviews-Melissani_Cave-Karavomylos_Sami_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Amazing Vista Point Great Food,"I visit this place time and time again because of its excellent food and the unique views. Relax at the Koroni beach and then head up to the canteen.
Tip: order by phone because the food is prepared on the spot (freshly cooked)!!",August 2016,Sesto Koroni Hill Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189457-d4581837-Reviews-Sesto_Koroni_Hill_Bar-Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Excellent Food & Service,"I've been three times on this fish tavern so it was about time to give it a review. All three times the food was delicious and the service was friendly, fast and not meretricious. The tavern is welcoming, warm and absolutely beautiful both on the outside and the inside. Will go again and again and again.",February 2016,Psarakia kai Thalassina Chalandri,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g562636-d8005369-Reviews-Psarakia_kai_Thalassina_Chalandri-Chalandri_Attica.html,"Chalandri, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0

That was a last,"The interior and exterior of the building are fantastic, but that's all there is to it. The food is costly and for the price you pay it should be much better than simply decent. The service was soooo bad that everything else seemed pointless. All 2 waiters and the ""host"" who ""served"" us had a very very bad attitude and made an effort to make sure that we knew that they were bored and that they were doing us a favour. The worse part was when they brought the food and had a conversation on top of my party's conversation. That was unbelievably rude. It's a real shame to see packed places which do not respect their customer's.",June 2014,Gaspar Food and Mood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2148293-Reviews-Gaspar_Food_and_Mood-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,3.5

"Excellent Food, Perfect Cocktails","The food here is absolutely great and the cocktails thrilling. Service was fast. The lady waiter that spoke English seemed not to be enjoying her job at all and wasn't that friendly. The other lady at the bar didn't speak English, nevertheless she was very joyful and helpful. Unfortunately there was no English menu so I had to translate for my fellows. The stuff said they do not have the menu in English because this is a local restaurant visited mostly by Spanish. Overall, if you speak Spanish, you have to visit eat and drink at Domino Bar.",October 2013,Bierzo food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d3753321-Reviews-Bierzo_food-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Expected more,"I've been to many stadiums around the globe and given the status and wealth of Barcelona FC, I was expecting to see an exceptional stadium. However, the stadium and all of its facilities were at a very-very poor condition. So bad that if I knew it, I would't have paid 23 euros for entry at the stadium and the museum, but only 5 euros to visit the modest museum, just to see the Barcelona's teams huge collections of trophies etc.",October 2013,Camp Nou,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d271009-Reviews-Camp_Nou-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,2.0,4.5

Stay here when visiting Paris,"When visiting Paris for whatever reason, prefer this hotel. It's right next to the city center and the metro station. It is spotless, comfy, beautifully decorated. Room 405 was absolutely great! The only difference between this room and a 5 star hotel room is the size, which by the way was not that small It was a perfect room in all aspects! Everything was absolutely perfect. A young guy at the night shift was very impolite and that was the only ""flaw"".",November 2012,Star Champs Elysees,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d233805-Reviews-Star_Champs_Elysees-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,5.0,4.0
Do not stay here,"The room (number 110) was spacious enough, however sleeping on those tiny beds was a dreadful experience. Not only were they tiny, but they also had very thin mattresses which means that one can feel the planking below and I tell you this really makes your whole body ache!! Moreover, the room was dirty (not even a small mirror in the room was clean, something so noticeable!), the bathroom was almost disgusting (not only was it dirty, but they haven’t even bothered to take off paint that has dripped on the walls and the tap). Also, this room smelt really bad, the heating was not sufficient, cold air and moisture was coming in the room from the door leading directly outside. When we tried to tell to the morning shift (a lady and a gentleman) that we had a problem with the heating, we couldn’t communicate as they wouldn’t understand much English. Later, when we got back to the room and realized that we still had a problem, we informed the night shift (who spoke fluent English) about the problem. He said heating is at maximum, that he had no extra portable heating and could do nothing. We also told him that the room smelt bad, he said I’ll have a look, but did nothing.",November 2012,HO36 Opera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187265-d669493-Reviews-HO36_Opera-Lyon_Rhone_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,"Lyon, France",hotels,1.0,3.0
"Excellent location, beautiful hotel","Hera hotel is very close to the “Acropolis” Metro station, and stands beside the most beautiful and quiet side of historical Athens and just one breath from the new Acropolis museum.
As soon as we entered the hotel, we were impressed of the classical line in decoration and the sense of luxury we felt. Very neat and nice spaces compose the whole picture of the hotel.
The staff was very polite and helpful.
Our room was beautifully decorated, with cozy spaces, a nice terrace and a very aesthetic bathroom.
Our favorite place was the dining area at the roof garden restaurant, where the very tasty meals were accompanied by the wonderful view of Acropolis, which captures your eyes especially when illuminated at night!!!
We loved our stay at Hera hotel and will definitely recommend it to friends.",June 2012,Hera Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d240838-Reviews-Hera_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
A 4* resort next to nature,"Stayed for a couple of nights. Both the resort and the natural environment are amazing. Great value for money. Spacious room wonderfully decorated, all tidy and clean. The owners were extremely friendly as was Omar on reception. The only problem we faced was with the air-con, but that was solved immediately. Have already recommended it to quite a few friends.",June 2012,Mare Dei Suites Hotel Ionian Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1192010-d2724108-Reviews-Mare_Dei_Suites_Hotel_Ionian_Resort-Skafidia_Pyrgos_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Skafidia, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
