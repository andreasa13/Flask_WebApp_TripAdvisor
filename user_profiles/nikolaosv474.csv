A truly amazing place,"Stayed there in August 2020 for a week. Immaculate rooms nice swimming pool clean and tidy throughout the hotel. The views are really astonishing overlooking Skiathos town and the nearby beach of Megali Ammos. The owners Tassos and Sotiris are extremely polite and always eager to serve their customers with their local knowledge. A really hearty breakfast is served in the open air restaurant/bar. A definite jewel in the island of Skiathos, highly recommended for families and couples alike.",August 2020,Hotel Rene,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g775993-d1473046-Reviews-Hotel_Rene-Skiathos_Town_Skiathos_Sporades.html,"Skiathos, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
