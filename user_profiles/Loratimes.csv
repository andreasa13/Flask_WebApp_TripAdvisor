One of the best hotel experiences ever,"Just a fantastic place with an immaculate, comfortable room. The kitchen had everything I needed as well- they really know what they're doing.
Staff was absolutely perfect- wouldn't change a thing about anything.",February 2020,Hyatt House Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187069-d12858322-Reviews-Hyatt_House_Manchester-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,5.0
Some of the best food and service in the UK,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience at this restaurant. It was an impromptu decision to eat here (we were going to just go to Five guys, but after standing and gawking at the prices on the Five Guys menu, we realized that we could have an actually NICE dinner for about the same price), and what a great decision it was!
I had a steak sandwich, which was in the top 2 beef experiences I've ever had in a UK restaurant, and fries, which were so awesome I couldn't stop eating them after I was full.
My partner had the tempura sea bass and fries, and he was incredibly pleased with it, making positive comments about it throughout the meal.
As for the sides: the onion rings were awesome- perfectly crispy/crunchy seasoned batter with just the right size onion inside, and the duck fat roast potatoes with onion and bacon were good, but probably would have been better than good if I'd gotten to them when they were hotter. I detected a faint gaminess in them, which will always turn me off, but my partner sensed no such thing, and loved them unconditionally.

We both had the unfiltered Tennent's lager, and it was great (though I wouldn't necessarily pass a taste test between unfiltered/unpasteurized vs normal lager).

The service was great, as well- very attentive and kind. We'd both recommend the hell out of this place.",February 2020,The Citizen Bar & Dining Rooms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186534-d12882484-Reviews-The_Citizen_Bar_Dining_Rooms-Glasgow_Scotland.html,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
What an amazing place,"Walked around here for about 2 hours, and loved it. It has such a wealth of impressive artifacts and the basement excavation area was just awesome.",December 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Amazing, beautiful, and well worth your time","I had a great day strolling among the ruins- everywhere you look, it seems like something important is there, even if it's not signposted.
Speaking of signs- the only written information at the site gives as much or more information about the archaeologists' work as they provide for the history/architecture of the structure I was there to see.",December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Disappointing food and service,"Even if a restaurant has only either good food OR good service, it can really bring a place up to 4 or 5 stars; I'd have to say this place had neither on the day I went.

Food:
The curried parsnip soup with toast was good.
I then had the fish and chips, and when they brought it out, I could see too much oil glistening on the chips, and the first bite of the fish tasted weird/bad, though of course it's difficult to judge on one bite. However, even after 3 small bites, I couldn't do it. The batter just tasted bad- I think it was the oil they used.
Upsides were the tartar sauce and sticky toffee pudding, though I've never actually had a bad one.

Service:
The staff was technically polite and brought me my food- eventually. That's the best I can say.
The worst I can say is that even though it was very slow in the restaurant, I was largely ignored until I had to stare at the staff to get attention before each order, which took longer (aside from the pudding) than made sense.
There was no follow-up, no questions at all, and certainly nothing proactive; just put down the food and leave immediately to chat with the other staff by the bar. Even though I had obviously left my meal largely uneaten, the server eventually whisked it away without comment or concern.
Like many, I'm already unlikely to do the uncomfortable job of complaining and/or sending food back, but the attitude of complete disinterest made the task seem even more pointless/uncomfortable, so I didn't. If I'd been asked anything about my meal or experience at all, I certainly would have.

I went to this restaurant after seeing so many raving reviews, awards, etc., and I'm not saying they don't deserve them- maybe it was just an off night. But this review is from my experience (it does not seek to expand to how the whole place is run normally), and my experience was honestly poor.",December 2019,Red Lion and Sun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2663600-Reviews-Red_Lion_and_Sun-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.5
"Good Location, Decent Food, Interesting Service","Food:
The basic fish and chips was good, but not mind-blowing. For one, I prefer not to eat the fish skin, though I'm told there are people who actually want it (aren't just neutral)... that said, even if it was skinless, it wouldn't have been amazing. The chips were also not all that great, but weren't remarkably bad either (see why this got an ""Average"" rating?). The peas were particularly great, actually, though I can't see upping a rating much for that.
Service:
SPECIFY WHETHER EATING IN- the staff may not ask.
We ordered at the counter, as we'd never been there and it was the first place with staff we saw, surrounded by menus. We didn't see any signs regarding eating in (sorry if we missed them). We intended to eat in, but we did not specify- and weren't asked. That last part is key because it turns out everything is different if you intend to eat in- especially the prices. We'd already paid and sat in the dining area, when a nice gentleman came over to us and explained that the price is different (extra Â£5) because you get unlimited chips and there will be mushy peas. It was kind of a scene, so I just said yes so they wouldn't make us eat elsewhere.
The whole experience didn't leave a good impression, as it was a totally avoidable embarrassment for all involved.",November 2019,Salt & Malt Wapping Wharf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186220-d12557751-Reviews-Salt_Malt_Wapping_Wharf-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Best Italian in aaaaaages,"My god, what an amazing meal!

Five stars without hesitation- awesome, awesome restaurant.

First, the bruschetta was simple and nothing short of fantastic, much like everything that came after. My date had the fresh tagliolini with crab, which he raved and raved about- even after we left. I had the handmade ravioli with pumpkin, and I had to consciously make myself slow down so's not to shovel it into my face. It was so buttery and beautiful... I could honestly eat it every day.

I'll absolutely be back as soon as I get the chance!",November 2019,Grato,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d17385148-Reviews-Grato-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Awesome food, great service","What a great place! The chicken tikka masala was delicious, though I fully agree with other reviewers that it was quite sweet (relative to all others I've had). The two of us fully agreed that it was a great restaurant, and that we'd happily return if ever in Prague again.

Easily the best hotel in London so far,"I mean, it's the best! Great location, spotless room, amazing service- what more do you want?
What's more, they made the stay extra-special by setting up the room with so many over-the-top nice, romantic touches for our trip together that we couldn't believe it. What a fantastic, thoughtful, amazing place- no way I'll stay somewhere else in London if I can afford to stay here again :)",November 2019,Park Grand London Kensington,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193143-Reviews-Park_Grand_London_Kensington-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Perfect Location in a Beautiful Medieval Village, But...","My partner and I stayed in beautiful Spello for 2 nights. I'll just break the stay into Pros and Cons for ease.

PROs:
- Location, location, location! I simply can't imagine a better one in Spello
- Parking was not far away (though by no means on the doorstep)
- Host was easy to contact (got back to my email the same day) and was very friendly,
showing me exactly where I could legally park
- Wine cellar insulation- in the hot days we were there, it was nice to have a cave climate
to come home to!
- Nicely decorated with beautiful floors and clean (except the bathroom- more on that
later)
- Private breakfast cove where we spent a lot of our time (more on that later)
- Good water pressure
- Price- great value!

CONs:
-Bathroom:
-- Windowless and not really light (I'd expect the lack of natural light to be compensated
for with other light), it had a MOLD/MILDEW problem (see pic)
-- Showering was somewhat difficult due to the incomprehensible tradition of the
showering area being only partly covered by glass (see pic)
-- Even the part that WAS covered leaked (behind the faucet), so that I had to use one of
the limited towels we were given on the problem
-Rest:
-- The internet was very shoddy- the only way to access it with any reliability was to go
outside to the breakfast area, which was beautiful thanks to the good weather
-- The bed was not only hard, but I felt the sharp springs in my hip and back
-- Though the cave climate was nice to come home to when it was hot outside, it was not
nice to live in overnight, when there is no heat allowed (by the city, apparently) during
the time of our stay
-- There was a cave aspect to the lighting as well as temperature- there were only two
sources of light, and since neither of those sources were exposed to the sun for at
least most of the day, it felt dark inside- even with the LED lights everywhere, which for
some reason made it feel even more cave-y
-- No laundry, and even if one washed laundry by hand, there was no good place to dry it

This unit is only one of those apparently offered at Residenza dei Cappuccini, though Travelocity uses photos of our apartment for the other offered, and I believe the amazing reviews must be predominantly for apartments other than ours.
I wish there was something on Trip Advisor between ""average"" and ""very good""... I'm pretty sure this place should get a ""good"" instead of average, but ""average"" is more honest than ""very good"" would be.",May 2015,La Residenza dei Cappuccini,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g672717-d2346867-Reviews-La_Residenza_dei_Cappuccini-Spello_Province_of_Perugia_Umbria.html,"Spello, Italy",hotels,3.0,4.5
"Great place, exceeded our expectations","The B&B was perfect for us. The owners constantly went out of their way to provide us with as much information about the area as possible, lending us maps and even offering to let us borrow a pair of their waterproof trousers! The accommodation was very clean and provided everything we needed. Breakfast was wonderful and well-presented and kept us going for hours. The surrounding countryside was beautiful, as it is set on a steep hill overlooking a bit of the valley and river below. We had a car, so everything we needed was within a few minutes' drive- gorgeous walks (that included windswept coastline and lovely woods), shops, etc. It was so nice (and for such a nice price!) that we actually stayed a night longer than planned. Unless you require nothing less than a flat screen tv and L'Occitane toiletries, this place is wonderful. Oh God, WAIT! I almost forgot about the BED!! The room we stayed in had a bed made of 2 twins put together, and unlike most hotels/b&bs, they made it so that it just felt like a huge, suuuuuuuper-comfortable bed as opposed to 2 twins shoved together hoping the guess wouldn't notice. The feather pillows and nice duvet didn't hurt, either.. Again, wonderful.",January 2012,Pine Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186257-d651603-Reviews-Pine_Lodge-Lynton_Exmoor_National_Park_England.html,"Lynton, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,5.0

One of two nice places to eat,"We ate here one night and at the Black Venus the other, and I prefer this one's atmosphere because of the seating by fireplaces and nice, homey feel (lots of dogs!) it gave us. The food was good enough for me to recommend, though the special Devon beer they served tasted kind of awful- like Budweiser or that kind of beer. Either way, the atmosphere was completely worth it and I'd definitely go again.",January 2012,The Blueball Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1109807-d1503421-Reviews-The_Blueball_Inn-Countisbury_Exmoor_National_Park_England.html,"Countisbury, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Fantastic Location, Great Room, Good Price","We were upgraded when we got there for no particular reason, so I don't know what the price would have been had we booked it instead, BUT either way, it was a very nice room. Basically, most of what I want and expect out of a hotel, etc. is that they CARE or at least pretend to. And I believe they actually do, judging by our room.
And the service was wonderful- they were cheerful and eager to help throughout our stay, which is always nice.
When I started writing this, I had clicked on 5 circle/stars/whatevers, but then I remembered these things:
The bed was not very comfortable. I don't mean that it was too hard or too soft, because that's a matter of taste, but no one's taste is to have springs you can feel poking into your hip. Ever.
And the breakfast was nowhere near the best (or, to be honest, worst) I've had at a hotel. The service was frustrating, and this is the first time I've noticed a terrible layout of an eating area, not to mention the food; there wasn't anything overly terrible about it (except the inedible canned mushrooms), it just wasn't.. up to par.
Oh, AND the windows were so poor that not only could you hear things outside as if they were open, but it let in a pretty serious draft.
ALL of this said, I'd still recommend it to people who know what to expect for less than a hundred pounds in central London and can be pleasantly surprised AND I'd happily stay here again.",January 2012,Blandford Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193054-Reviews-Blandford_Hotel-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Just a Mojito and a Creme Brulee,"Even though that's all we got, I wasn't impressed with the place. Having seen it in there -it was pretentiously ritzy, which is in itself means I won't go there again- I didn't have a good enough Mojito OR creme brulee (which were actually pretty good) to go back. The price isn't terrible, but it's not great either.",January 2012,Sherlock's Bar and Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1165393-Reviews-Sherlock_s_Bar_and_Grill-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
There is no way I'd stay here again.,"Well, it WAS cheap, considering there were 3 of us. I don't think, though, that the people leaving such glowing reviews stayed in the triple room, which needs WORK. We're the types of travelers that are happy to trade luxury for a solid base of cleanliness, comfort, and service.
All of these things were lacking for us. Ready?
Cleanliness:
The shower was moldy, dark, and small- so unpleasant, in fact, that I couldn't make myself use it. I'm comfortable saying that the bathroom was all around bad. THEN we found a bunch of trash in one of the drawers (that was promptly and apologetically removed by the staff member). Moving on to the more public areas, one of my party pointed out, laughing, that if all they serve is ceral and coffee for breakfast, what the hell could have kept them from getting that 5th food hygiene star?! Well, by the end of our stay, we knew- not only was the table we sat at dirty (and made up, so there was clearly no intent to further clean before breakfast) the night we arrived, but the table we sat at the next morning was also dirty, with the cherry on the cake of this experience being that one of us noticed that the napkin meant for him to use was actually already used.

Comfort:

Though the duvets and throw pillows were nicely presented and as far as I remember, the bed was comfortable, there was a super, SUPER bright light outside our window, making it hard for any of us to get to sleep (we put a towel up to try to block some of it).

Service:

The main area of the hotel was the reception desk with a couch behind us and the breakfast area to one side (right by our room, actually). Said couch was always taken up by the person at reception watching loud films on the huge tv, and talking on his cell phone leaving us to sit at a dirty table in the breakfast area.

Honestly, about half an hour after we arrived, we were looking up other hotels that we could possibly switch to, but almost all hotels in the area were booked. If you're booking with some notice, book somewhere else.",October 2011,Heathrow Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g528813-d1818018-Reviews-Heathrow_Palace-Hounslow_Greater_London_England.html,"Hounslow, United Kingdom",hotels,2.0,3.0
Absolutely perfect,"Stop reading the reviews and book this hotel.
My fiance and I stayed here for 2 nights and it was one of the best, if not the best hotel experiences we've ever had. Cleanliness, friendliness, and a feeling of luxury were obviously priorities here and should be looked to by other hotels as to how to conduct themselves. The location was plenty easy to get to and from and the breakfast was the best hotel breakfast I've ever had.
The service was (again) friendly, but it was also very knowledgeable and helpful- no matter what we asked, there were recommendations and instructions from that wonderful staff.
AND they greeted us with champagne upon arrival AND because we were there on a honeymoon of sorts, left us a bottle of wine just to be NICE.
Fantastic. There is no way I'd ever stay anywhere else in Prague- if trying to operate on a budget, I may give up a meal here and there to afford the place.",August 2011,Hotel General,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d782524-Reviews-Hotel_General-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,5.0,5.0
Cheap and with character,"The character of the place is why I do not rate it lower. My fiance and I stayed in a room which had a shower IN the room as opposed to a private area for it, which wouldn't have been THAT bad, had the shower been clean enough. The dark shower curtain also made it difficult to see while showering. There was also a toilet ""room"" which had a dinky accordion door, making THAT not very private either. That aside, it was really the cleanliness that I took issue with. I like character and for all hotels to not be alike, but the one standard I would love EVERY hotel to operate under the same is cleanliness.
That said, it is a good location and a low price, so if you can take it, do it.",September 2011,Villa Saphir,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187234-d1113462-Reviews-Villa_Saphir-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html,"Nice, France",hotels,3.0,3.5
Friendly,"I found the service to be very friendly and family-like, though the accommodation itself seemed to be a bit.. clinical? The building felt like an ex-nursing home, which was just sort of unpleasant. For the price, though, I think I'd stay there again, since there was nothing terribly wrong with the place, it just wasn't a NICE place is all.",September 2011,Hotel Les Epingliers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1079996-d551217-Reviews-Hotel_Les_Epingliers-Saint_Andre_les_Vergers_Aube_Grand_Est.html,"Saint-Andre-les-Vergers, France",hotels,3.0,4.0
"Clean, practical","If you stay in the building opposite the reception building (which I had assumed would be where we'd stay), you will stay in a relatively large, modern, key-entered building with heavy doors and probably your own balcony or patio. There was no real character to the place, but it was entirely sufficient for what we needed, albeit a bit less .. romantic than we'd hoped. That said, the reception building was absolutely beautiful- antique-seeming with marble (I think..) everywhere and high, rich curtains that flowed to the floor.
The breakfast was good, especially for the price and they had a lovely touch, which was to offer fresh croissants and drinks whenever we wanted them. Oh, and they were super-friendly and if one of them couldn't speak much English, they did their best to find someone who did.",September 2011,Albergo Antica Corte Marchesini,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1439489-d1956392-Reviews-Albergo_Antica_Corte_Marchesini-Campagna_Lupia_Veneto.html,"Campagna Lupia, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Good location, nice hotel","I had reservations about the quality of the hotel when we booked it because of its low price, but I was very pleasantly surprised to be wrong. Small as to be expected, clean, and modern, it's a fantastic value for the money. Though the halls were a bit dingy as I remember, this hotel is the type to put little candies on your bed- a service I personally always like. Speaking of service, the receptionist spoke perfect English and was incredibly helpful when asked questions.
I'd definitely recommend this place unless you're expecting a bunch of French beauty and character. It's a modern place for a great price.",September 2011,Kyriad Grenoble Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187264-d197282-Reviews-Kyriad_Grenoble_Centre-Grenoble_Isere_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,"Grenoble, France",hotels,5.0,4.0
Amazingly cheap for a perfectly acceptable hotel.,"This hotel is plenty-close to everything you'd want to see, the rooms are small, clean and tasteful, and all for an incredibly low price (two of us stayed here for 3 nights for a total of â¬140). The ventilation was fantastic because of having an openable skylight AND a window on the wall, so we got a nice breeze when we wanted one.
The only downsides are the 3 flights of stairs you really only want to trek once or twice (god forbid you forget your keys) and the shower. Though magnificently clean and pretty, it is the least practical shower design I've had to use; it's like someone who had taken a shower once when they were very young designed it as an adult. They seem to remember that the shower head was ridiculously high on the wall (I am not 7'4"", so this didn't work out so well for me) and apparently didn't remember much about whether or not to enclose the shower at all, and if so by how much. Since the shower..""door"" only covers half of the shower AND the (nice and powerful, by the way) shower head is over 7' on the wall, the bathroom was soaked daily.
Other than that, awesome hotel for an unbelievable price.

Ps. Though the breakfast is a fair â¬6, it's not very good and you'd likely be able to find better near the place for the same price or less.",August 2011,Hotel Roudna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274706-d617912-Reviews-Hotel_Roudna-Pilsen_Pilsen_Region_Bohemia.html,"Pilsen, Czech Republic",hotels,5.0,4.5
