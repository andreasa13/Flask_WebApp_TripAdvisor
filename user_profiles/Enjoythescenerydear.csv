Iconic rock in New Plymouth,"Definitely climb it if you have suitable shoes (not jandals) and are sort of moderately fit. The main difficulty is mental ... don't look down if you are afraid of heights. I nearly chickened out part way up the first time I climbed it. The first part is all wooden steps, but then the second part gets steeper and requires holding onto a chain and scrambling hands and feet up rocks. There are plenty of footholds, and it's not difficult, but can make you feel dizzy if you don't have a good head for heights. I wouldn't do it with a toddler or a 3 year old. Nice 360degree views at the top, and a nice flat area to stand so you don't need to feel scared once you're up there. Coming down is no worse than going up ... just take it slowly.",February 2020,Sugar Loaf Islands and Paritutu Rock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255112-d3235856-Reviews-Sugar_Loaf_Islands_and_Paritutu_Rock-New_Plymouth_Taranaki_Region_North_Island.html,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",attractions,4.0,4.5

A delight to the eyes and the nose,"It's a little perfume shop with beautiful Victorian-inspired decor and a friendly man who explains the perfumes.

Nice free thing to visit,"Nice rose garden.

$5 for a ride up - Do it!,"Only $5 each for a ride up the cable car. It's only a 5 minute ride, but rather cool and saves a slog up the hill. Then you have a nice view over the city, a cafe, museum, perfume shop and Zealandia you can visit, and then take a meandering walk down the hill through the botanical gardens.

Rather overpriced. Mildly interesting.,"$25 each for a boat ride to Somes Island. No commentary on the boat, and they did sell tea and coffee, but they had no milk sorry. The island was nice enough, with some nice views of the surrounds, but I had heard it was a bird sanctuary and so expected to see more bird life than I did. It was pleasant weather, so rather nice to stroll around the island, and to see the old gun emplacements was mildly interesting, but you can't go to much of the shoreline - only by the wharf; the rest is off limits. Hmm, for $50 for 2 of us, I reckon there are better things you can spend your money on. But a couple we met came for free on their gold cards, in which case it would be much better value.",January 2020,Matiu / Somes Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255115-d2477245-Reviews-Matiu_Somes_Island-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Island.html,"Wellington, New Zealand",attractions,3.0,4.5

All the wait staff have foreign accents (very sexy), gave impeccable service; the food is fancy and very delicious ... like really, really delicious, so long as you don't mind trying a few unusual things... and with sorbets between the courses to 'cleanse your pallet' ; the decor is classy and luxurious, and the prices, well, the prices match everything else shall we say.... Not a place for the budget conscious, except, like us, if it's a very occasional splurge for a special occasion.

"Central location, helpful staff, nice hotel","A great place to stay in Wellington, being only 5 mins walk to the cable car, and a little supermarket, and the waterfront. We stayed 4 nights in January for a short holiday and it was an easy walk to most things, and also to the railway station if you want to go further afield. The hotel has a fitness room, and a restaurant which provides breakfast (pretty nice with several options) and dinner (we didn't try). The only reason I gave only 4 stars was that there is no air conditioning in the rooms of the hotel, and as our room was on the west side of the building, it got rather warm in the afternoon/evening, and the window could only open a few inches (being on the 12th floor) ... luckily for us the weather was only 16 - 18 degrees while we were there, but in hotter weather it would be quite hot in the room, with only a fan to cool down. However, everything else you need was provided, the beds were comfy, a microwave, fridge, plates and cutlery meant we could have a meal in our room if we wanted. Hair dryer and iron too. All very clean and well kept. We had asked for a quiet room and were initially put in room on the top floor. It was very windy and a creaking sound could be heard occasionally from the roof above when the wind blew (probably aerials or some structure blowing in the wind. Knowing this would interrupt our sleep if it happened at night, I asked if we could have a different room, which is the sort of thing I really hate doing. But the staff were very helpful and found us another room which didn't have this problem. All in all, an excellent place to stay, except perhaps in hot weather if your room faces west.",January 2020,Travelodge Hotel Wellington,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255115-d256498-Reviews-Travelodge_Hotel_Wellington-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Island.html,"Wellington, New Zealand",hotels,4.0,4.0
a must see,"I visited the parthenon in Athens in early October about 4pm.... definitely recommend visiting this site late afternoon.

Go late in the afternoon,"I went at 5:30 pm. I'd recommend going about 5pm just to give yourself a bit more time - it closed at 6:30 in October. The crowds are less, there queue for tickets is only about 2 or 3 people (so you can buy a 20 euro ticket instead of a 23 euro one online), and best of all, the lighting is wonderful for photos! I had just under an hour, but would have spent longer if I'd been able to. Before leaving my accomodation I downloaded onto my phone an audio podcast for free by Rick Steves ... its 55 mins long (but you'll need more time than that - I had stopped skip bits cos I was running out of time) ... it was so helpful to have that extra information and I gained a lot more from my visit by having that to listen to. He also has podcasts for the Agora and the archeological museum and a city walk one. The Agora one was good too but I haven't listened to the others yet. As for the parthenon, 20 euros is a fairly pricey... but you're only visiting Athens once aren't you? And the parthenon really is a magnificent ancient sight. Amazing views and late afternoon offers incredible photo lighting.

Lovely way to see Lyon.,"Lovely way to see Lyon. The bikes make it easy. It was the first time I'd ridden an ebike, although Ive ridden a normal bike plenty in the past. Even after 4 hours (3 hours of actual biking) we were not tired out. The tour was largely on cycle ways near the river or in the park, but some was on narrow streets in Lyon. We took the 4 hour tour with food tasting version of the tour, but really it was only one stop for bread, cheese and salami and a glass of wine ... not really much, so if you're wanting to save money, you could take the 2.5 hour tour.... although the 4 hour tour people also got to go up the hill to see the basilica (not difficult at all with an bike!) All in all a great way to fill in half a day in Lyon, and you see way more than you would by going on foot. I think we covered 20 km in total.

Allow plenty of time,"Rather pricey but you could spend all day there. Lovely gardens, although I think the free parts are best. The interior of the castle is extensive and well presented. Audio guides are easy to navigate, with expert level and family level options for level of detail. Nice place for lunch, with lots of options, at the Tiltyard Cafe.

Interesting and detailed,"Our guide, Dave, was passionate about his subject and a wealth of information. It took 1 1/2 hours and could have been longer except that we said that was long enough. However it was all very interesting and we saw things we never would have seen or appreciated in the same way without the tour. It was worth braving the drizzle to take the 10 pound outside tour rather than the 12 pound tour of the painted ceiling that the i-site staff were pushing. The tour included info about and exterior views of the Naval hospital, Cutty Sark, King James III's palace, interior of a chapel, Queen Anne's palace interior and gardens, and climbing the hill to exterior of Royal observatory, including a tucked away free spot to stand on the Greenwich meridian line for a photo. Dave also had several photocopied of pictures to illustrate and explain his talk. Highly recommended for those who like to see more than just the surface of things and who have a little time. We followed up by a delicious late lunch in the restaurant near the info centre.

looks lovely but was disappointed,"I've been before for a cuppa and something sweet. The displayed food looks so nice, and this time was wanting a meal and was looking forward to the experience. The cabinet looked great - so many choices! I went for a salad - choice of up to three in a dish. Roast vegetable salad looked amazing. BUT it was too salty, and despite being 'warmed up' it was still partly cold. Service was slow and the place not busy so they had plenty of time to warm it properly. Hubby thought his bacon panini was salty too - and that's saying something! Was going to have a cuppa, but left my meal half eaten and went elsewhere. I told the staff that the reason I hadn't eaten all my meal was that it was too salty (you know, in case they might like to improve their next batch, or offer something else), they shrugged their shoulders and said 'sorry.' Well, sorry, but I won't be going back.",June 2019,Cafe Nosh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g658486-d3785417-Reviews-Cafe_Nosh-Waimate_Canterbury_Region_South_Island.html,"Waimate, New Zealand",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Food and tea were delicious,"I had 'Paris' tea, served in a very pretty tea pot, and it was fragrant and delightful. The raspberry gluten free slice was excellent - I didn't buy if for gluten free, I bought it for raspberry, and it was really nice, and not weird like some gluten-free stuff is. Nice decor, good service. But I do think they need better extraction fans in their kitchen ... the kitchen is basically in the same room as the cafe so the smell of slightly burnt oil/butter somewhat spoilt the refined atmosphere.

A feast of beautiful views,"Very scenic. This is my favourite of the great walks (though I haven't done the Milford). This track just keeps giving and giving - one more beautiful scene after another... especially in fine weather, which I was fortunate to have the second time I walked it. Take a better camera than your cell phone! Track very well maintained, although a few bits are rockier and rootier than your average piece of Great Walk track. Loos spaced at regular intervals! Gas and cookers in the huts. What more could you ask? (steak for dinner and your food carried, but you'd have to pay $$$ for that and be in a big group of walkers... so skip that). Can get quite chilly at night in the bunkrooms that are not above the fire-heated living room (as one at Lake MacKenzie was). Be prepared for alpine conditions and cold, and possible rain, but rejoice if you get sunshine because the views are lovely...especially if there is a bit of snow on the tops of the mountains. Even in rain though, the mossy bush is lovely and the waterfalls spectacular. Summit absolutely worth going up. But Conical Hill sidewalk from Harris saddle should only be attempted in very good conditions - it's steep (hands and feet climbing in a few spots) and even in brilliant sunshine there was ice in shady spots which could make the climb potentially treacherous. I'm in my 50s and not a super-fit runner or anything, but this is doable for anyone with a reasonable level of fitness who is happy to just keep plodding, and will feel rewarded by fresh air and beautiful scenery. The walk is best done over 3 days.

Negatives: Quite disappointed with the bunk beds in dormitory ... every time the top person turned over the whole bed moved, causing a most disturbed sleep. I had especially looked at the pictures to make sure they were not squeaky metal bunks, and the wooden bunks looked sturdy, but were not as good as they looked.

Budget accomodation is very budget,"Beware their budget accomodation is not so budget because there are no kitchen facilities for your use ... which means you have to eat dry food or buy in their hotel... which will eliminate the 'budget' aspect. The budget cabins require running outside (through rain?) to the loo or shower or laundry or for water. When we plugged in the jug the fuse for two cabins blew so we lost power ... rousing the owner he did come immediately to sort the problem. On the good side the beds were very comfortable, even though the rooms were very 'cosy', the curtains were blackout, it was quiet, there were fan heaters in the rooms and there were outdoor sensor lights for your nocturnal toilet trips.",April 2019,The Glenorchy Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1025721-d646211-Reviews-The_Glenorchy_Hotel-Glenorchy_Otago_Region_South_Island.html,"Glenorchy, New Zealand",hotels,2.0,3.5
Delighful,"Lovely spot to visit, especially if you are interested in things historical, or in gardens. Beautiful big old trees in the garden and old fashioned flowers around the house. The house is lovingly restored/rebuilt, and furnished with items from the period. Interesting notices on the walls about the past owners or with quotes from a book by original owner... the book is available to purchase. Photos of the restoration process. Very informative volunteers available to talk with you about the history of the place. Lovely views towards the harbour. And devonshire tea in bone china tea cups available to purchase in the historic railway station located behind the house. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the scones were a little, shall we say, 'solid' compared to some I have eaten. But really, the house visit and the devonshire tea are excellent value for money and a charming way to spend an hour or so.",February 2019,Historical Athenree Homestead,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g656916-d3421714-Reviews-Historical_Athenree_Homestead-Katikati_Bay_of_Plenty_Region_North_Island.html,"Katikati, New Zealand",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Nice, clean, quiet street","The pros: Clean. Has a little kitchen so you can cook meals and save money instead of eating out. Reasonably comfy bed. Very handy location - walking distance to central Tauranga shops, and in a pretty quiet street with no major traffic going past. Friendly, helpful staff
The cons: No air conditioner and rather hot - bedroom faced west so got the evening sun and since the window could only open a little (due to safety lock) it took a while to cool down. The best solution was to close all the curtains before going out for the day so the rooms did not heat up too much. Our stay was in February and it was warm. Wouldn't be such an issue at other times of the year. Hot plates were those solid ones which take ages to heat up, and the handle of one was broken so I had to use a knife to turn it. You can hear through the wall when the people in the neighbouring room boil their jug or do their dishes ... so no sleeping in if they are early birds.",February 2019,Roselands Motel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255114-d257256-Reviews-Roselands_Motel-Tauranga_Bay_of_Plenty_Region_North_Island.html,"Tauranga, New Zealand",hotels,3.0,4.5

Beginner Downhill track not for beginners,"First time at the CAP. The beginner downhill track sign said ""Gentle Riding .... Must have ridden a bike before."" That sounded ok; couldn't be too difficult... so we decided to start with that. Our family was 2x 50 ish, 18 and 21. We all thought it was much harder than advertised. The 18yo fell and grazed her leg pretty badly. Even the 21 yo male was surprised at the difficulty of a beginner track. Yes we had mountain bikes. Yes we've all ridden bikes before. But you are basically holding the brake the whole way down and having your bones shaken while trying to avoid the ruts as much as possible. Not an enjoyable experience.
In our enthusiasm we had foolishly purchased 5x lift tickets as the price per ride is much cheaper that way. To their credit, the staff (finally, after speaking with the manager when I requested) did refund our other 4 rides for the 2 females in our group. The males are however doubtful that they'll use their other rides up. Tickets are not transferable so don't be tempted to buy a 5 ride ticket until you have tried it once to see if it's your thing. I recommend this activity to young males with high testosterone, undeveloped cerebral cortexes and low appreciation of risk. They'll love it. But make sure they have plenty of protective gear.",January 2019,Christchurch Adventure Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255118-d11932050-Reviews-Christchurch_Adventure_Park-Christchurch_Canterbury_Region_South_Island.html,"Christchurch, New Zealand",attractions,3.0,5.0

Nice service. They have a bar sort of area near the tv for those who want to watch sport, but also a nice area away from all that for when you just want a nice meal and chat.
Also worth a visit to the loos to see the cool decor.
Not one of those places that has chips with everything. Overall, a bit nice than Montieths or the Lone Star.
