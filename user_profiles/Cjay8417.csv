Fun date night,"Not sure what to expect on this one, but we had a lot of fun. Cast was super funny and interactive. Dinner was good. Got to meet a lot of new people. The mystery was complicated enough to keep you guessing all through the night. I’d do it again.",November 2019,The Dinner Detective Interactive Murder Mystery Show,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60922-d10723755-Reviews-The_Dinner_Detective_Interactive_Murder_Mystery_Show-Salt_Lake_City_Utah.html,"Salt Lake City, Utah",attractions,5.0,4.0
Impressive!,"It’s a long ride from Athens, but the views are stunning. We did a single day tour— to Kalampaka and back— and if we were to do it again, we’d stay a night. Tour was really good but a word of caution: if you book a tour, work directly with your guide if you run into any issues. We booked ours through a separate entity and tried working with them through a ticketing issue we had. Rather, we should have called our guide directly. Anyway, lots of people on these tours. Lots of traffic. But well worth it.",October 2019,Meteora Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315843-d7059256-Reviews-Meteora_Tour-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Wow!,"Best advice— be there when it opens. Within an hour there’ll be hoards of people all pushing for better pictures. We did not use a guide, but if I were to go again, I’d get one. I overheard several guides along the way and the information they were sharing seemed very interesting. Plus there’s enough on the hill besides the Parthenon to warrant some understanding. A good alternative is Rick Steve’s app, but I couldn’t get mine to work. Anyway, wear nice shoes with a good grip and be prepared to be amazed. It really is quite breathtaking when you see it in person.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Strenuous but worth it,"Lots of steps! However, once you get to the other side, make your way to the church below. Very quiet and the views are worthy of Santorini. You need to be fit for this one.",October 2019,Skaros Rock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635864-d3300798-Reviews-Skaros_Rock-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worth 26€,"This expedition wasn’t planned. We saw it on an advertisement while walking through Fira. We are glad we booked it. The tour of the volcano was very interesting and provided us with a perspective of Santorini that we didn’t know. Our guide was great. The boat was fun but seemed a bit too crowded. The trip to Thirasia was ok...we ate at the recommended place called The Rock but didn’t care much for it. Instead, get a gyro at Nicks near the dock. Much cheaper and better tasting IMO. But getting off there allowed us to see a different version of Santorini as well so it was fun. We did not swim at the hot springs but many did. It was a little hard to hear our guide while on the boat. Just be sure to have good hiking shoes. Many in our group wore flip flops and I saw several who had to go barefoot after their shoes broke. Overall it was worth 26€ and four hours.",October 2019,"Caldera Half Day Tour (Volcano, Hot Springs, Thirassia)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189433-d17525405-Caldera_Half_Day_Tour_Volcano_Hot_Springs_Thirassia-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegea.html,"Santorini, Greece",activities,5.0,4.0
Fun Hike,"If you have about 2-3 hours and some good shoes, you need to do this hike from Fira to Oia. I was skeptical— seeing Oia in the distance looked like a daunting undertaking. But we set out with a bottle of water. It was strenuous in some places. In other places you walk along streets. But the views are unquestionably beautiful. Few people were out when we went, so it was quiet too. There are so many opportunities for pictures along the way. And when we got to Oia, we had plenty of eating places, stores, and more photo opps to choose from. We then took a bus back to Fira which costs 1.80 Euros each. Best to do this one early in the day as I imagine it gets pretty warm by noon.",October 2019,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d2368798-Reviews-Hiking_Trail_Fira_Oia-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
