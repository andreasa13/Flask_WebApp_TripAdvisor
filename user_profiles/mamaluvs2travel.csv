Loved it! Cool atmosphere.,"Loved it! Cool atmosphere. Definitely worth the wait for a patio seat on a nice night. We were starving, so we chose a seat inside and enjoyed our dining experience. Server was friendly and attentive. Chicken pot pie, crispy Buffalo cauliflower, fish and chips all received great reviews from our table. Salmon was good, but needed more salt (and I’m not typically someone who uses table salt). Churros and chocolate waffle were amazing!

Skip the 7 Falls Hike,"Beautiful park with lots of trails to hike, however, the hike to 7 Falls is not for the faint of heart. It’s blazing hot, so go early because it’s about 4 miles to the Falls and unless you’re bringing water with you, you’ll feel very dehydrated through this trek. Parts of the trail were not well marked and you could easily find yourself off route. Overall, I’d say if you’re going to do this hike, be well hydrated, wear shoes that are supportive but also shoes you’re not concerned about getting dirty or ruined, and APPLY SUNSCREEN.",April 2021,Sabino Canyon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60950-d209268-Reviews-Sabino_Canyon-Tucson_Arizona.html,"Tucson, Arizona",attractions,4.0,4.5

A must-see if you are in Athens,"This is definitely a must-see if you are in Athens. It is truly amazing to see the ancient architecture. Visiting during what is considered the off-season still drew quite a crowd, so I can only imagine how crowded it is in the summer. As the other reviews state, wear comfortable shoes because its quite a bit of walking/climbing and the terrain is uneven. The site is also very exposed to sunlight, so don’t forget a hat and/or sunscreen. Also, there are quite a few people outside of the park who will try to put bracelets on your arm for “free”. They are not free and it’s a really awkward situation. My advice is either say no and keep moving or plan on bringing a euro or two per bracelet (which are actually very cute).",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Cool experience,"The only reason I’m giving this 4 stars is because it’s the Eiffel Tower and it’s something you should experience if you are in Paris. We waited forever in line to purchase tickets to go up. When we got up to one of the two ticket windows open, the lady closed that window without explanation and we were left standing there wondering if we should wait or try to merge into the other ticket window line. We ended up merging over but there was zero direction from any staff. When we were finally at the window, my husband asked the woman behind the counter a question about purchasing tickets for the following day so that our daughter could go all the way up to the top. She would only answer with a dismissive “maybe”. Once up at the observation deck, it’s a beautiful view of the city, but extremely crowded. You can easily become separated from your group so it’s best to set a time to meet up at the bottom, just in case. Overall, I would expect better crowd management.

"Fresh, beautiful food","We ate here because we were trying to go to Strawberry Street Cafe and quickly realized the change in restaurants. They’ve renovated the inside. It’s beautiful, clean, with a modern edge. Hostess was very nice. My biggest issue was the lack of description about the dishes on the menu. Food was FRESH and artsy. Beautiful plate presentation. We had the babaganoush and kimchi rice. Both were delicious! Husband order a beef dish. Flavor was fantastic but meat was a little tough. Wine was good. Our son ordered pasta from the kids menu. If your child doesn’t have a sophisticated palate, they will likely leave hungry. Personally, I enjoyed his buttered, fresh fettuccine noodles, but he did not. I would definitely suggest this place for a date night.

Delicious,"We enjoyed our dinner at Cafe Provençal. The charcuterie board is a must. The pairings were delightful. Our server said the charcuterie board is ever-changing. I can definitely recommend the filet. Cooked perfectly. The pork tenderloin was a bit disappointing due to the size. Flavor was fantastic, but it was about the size of a medium-sized rib, with very few sides to make up for it. Dessert was delicious. Our server was great. We definitely look forward to going back.",June 2019,Cafe Provencal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58313-d1581639-Reviews-Cafe_Provencal-Williamsburg_Virginia.html,"Williamsburg, Virginia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Loved this place!,"Had dinner with my daughter and absolutely loved this place. It was so nice to sit in the restaurant with the open-air windows. Restaurant was beautifully decorated and menu had so many fun options. We both opted for Cobb salad with blackened chicken. Quite possibly one of the best Cobb salads I’ve ever eaten. We shared the Krispy Kreme bread pudding for dessert. Fun, cool vibe.

Good Family Spot,"This place is a lovely spot for a family meal. Staff were very attentive and super friendly. Shoe-string fries were delicious! We were not impressed by the Nashville fried chicken. It was hot, but flavorless. The fried pickles were tasty, but for the life of me, I will never understand why a restaurant chooses pickle spears over pickle chips.

Fun place but very crowded,"This is truly the Chuck E. Cheese for adults- right down to the small plastic cups to hold your tokens. You need to start by getting a card that you link to your credit/debit card. That card you keep on you for the night and use at their self-serve taps. You just bring the card to the counter at the end of your night and they give you the tab. Pretty simple. Lots of games to play, including fun blasts from the past. The only drawback is that it’s pretty crowded. Otherwise, it’s a fun place to check out with friends",February 2019,The Circuit Arcade Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60893-d14943340-Reviews-The_Circuit_Arcade_Bar-Richmond_Virginia.html,"Richmond, Virginia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Cool place,"My child’s sports team participated in a 3-day tournament at ESPN. The atmosphere here is very cool. They do a good job with field maintenance and the grounds are clean. My only complaint is they do a good job of getting as much money out of you as possible. If you get an adult beverage, you pay extra for the cup, then a reduced price after that if you’d like another drink. The next day, they change the cup color, so you have to buy the cup again each day. They bring in food trucks, with great food, but be cautious because some of the food trucks are very overpriced. Overall, this was a very good experience with a fun, upbeat atmosphere",February 2019,ESPN Wide World of Sports,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d116405-Reviews-ESPN_Wide_World_of_Sports-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great place to stay,"This was our first time staying here and we enjoyed it. It was easy to set up transportation to the hotel from the airport via the Magic Express. Rooms were clean. Hotel had some construction going on. Good variety of restaurants. If we go back, we will definitely get the meal plan. Nice gym onsite. Hotel staff were very friendly.

Ok but expensive,"We traveled with a group and decided it would be fun to eat here on the first night of our trip. The atmosphere is pretty cool, but if you’ve been to one Planet Hollywood, you’ve kinda been to them all. I had the steak salad. It was good, but pretty typical and expensive. Be weary of the upselling for a souvenir glass. Service was ok. Our server seemed to have an attitude when we weren’t all buying overpriced alcohol in cheesy souvenir glasses, instead requesting water. I put that more on his maturity level than the restaurant though.",February 2019,Planet Hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34515-d472490-Reviews-Planet_Hollywood-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",restaurants,3.0,3.5
"Bathrooms were dirty, customer service down","I’m a big lover of Disney and the Magic Kingdom. The Magic Kingdom is still, I believe, one of the greatest places to bring children. I was a bit disappointed this visit though. The bathrooms were so dirty this visit. I understand the high volume of visitors, but we’ve visited during peak times of the year, and the bathrooms were much cleaner then. I witnessed one staff member in the bathroom on her phone and not attending to the needed bathroom care. This really surprised me. I was also taken back by the dismissive attitude of the workers at one of the food vendors. I’ve never seen Disney through this lens before- made it feel like an average theme park visit rather than the magical place I’ve visited in the past",February 2019,Magic Kingdom Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d143395-Reviews-Magic_Kingdom_Park-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,3.0,4.5

Lovely evening,"We came in town for one night to see a show at Ford’s Theater. We stayed at the JW Marriott and chose Old Ebbitt Grill so that we could park the car at check in to the hotel and not move it again until we checked out. We really enjoyed our dinner. I would definitely recommend making reservations. Our server was attentive and friendly. The food was delicious. I had the scallops and my husband had a pasta dish.

Not overly impressed,"We’ve driven by many times and have always seen this placed packed. We’ve also heard good things about this place. We decided to head over after watching a baseball game at the Diamond. Perhaps it’s because we were seated outside, but our waiter just continued to forget about us. I mean, gone, and this happened more than once. He was very nice and always apologetic when he’d come back to our table. However, after waiting for over 20 minutes for him to return with our credit card after giving it to him for the bill, we had finally reached our limit. As crowded as we’ve seen this restaurant, it was not nearly as busy as those nights, so I have to lean towards poor time management on the part of the server. Food was average. The consensus of the table was we had all had better burgers in RVA. Milkshakes were very good, not too thick and not too thin. All in all, we aren’t hard pressed to go back.",September 2018,Boulevard Burger and Brew,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60893-d9769847-Reviews-Boulevard_Burger_and_Brew-Richmond_Virginia.html,"Richmond, Virginia",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Nice hotel,"This is a very nice hotel, centrally located. Very clean. Check in was a bit congested. I would suggest you check your reservation carefully. I called to book our room and did not book online. I specifically asked for 2 beds, as we were traveling as a family of 4. When we got to the room, there was one double bed. I called guest services and spoke with a woman who was rude and simply stated all rooms with double beds were booked for the night. I asked for a cot, she said she didn’t have any. She offered NO solutions and was very unapologetic, stating that was the room I booked. I insisted I would never book one queen bed for a family of 4. The conversation was over on her end. I called back and requested extra blankets and pillows. I continued to call throughout the day, leaving two messages for management. I received a call back from a woman who was very nice and offered a king room with a pullout. By the time we got back to the hotel after the baseball game, we spoke with Alex at the front desk and he stated a room with 2 double beds had become available. He was very accommodating and we appreciate his assistance. Also great was Gary, valet/front door. He was very welcoming and gave us great info about the city. Rooms are clean and beds were comfortable. There’s a restaurant and bar onsite. Tons of families and a good hotel if you are traveling with kids. Not far from subway. Overall, we would definitely stay here again but I will make sure to double check the reservation, as my email confirmation was very vague.",July 2018,Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d93555-Reviews-Sheraton_New_York_Times_Square_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,4.0,4.0
