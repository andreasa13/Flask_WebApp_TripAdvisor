Fabulous food and service,"We were on a time limit due to a show at Her Majesty’s and the staff were amazing to ensure we had time to enjoy the meal and make the show.

The oysters in the coconut curry were out of this world we had to order another serve.

The spanner crab was so different, tasty and great element of spice. The octopus was tender and lovely spice to it

"Excellent wines, attention to service and food","Wow, a must visit - highly recommend as the staff know their wines and food, cocktails also amazing- service was knowledgeable and efficient without interfering in our night out so we could still talk.

Fabulous,"Very impressed with the food, service and location. Oh and the wines

We did the discovery meal and pairing wines and none of us were disappointed. Having said that we did find that maybe the 5 courses would have been enough as the 7 was very filling.

The wines were perfectly matched.

Different,"Quite enjoyed this space - loved the 80’s decor but we sat outside as a gorgeous Saturday afternoon

Hidden gem in a country town,"Wow, what a find and completely unexpected as we hadn’t been to Maldon for a couple of years (or more time flies)

The gentleman behind the counter (I think owner) was so generous with his patience as I worked out what cheeses I wanted to eat with a lovely glass of wine.

He helped and offered suggestions and I wasn’t disappointed

Loved it,"Thanks to our Bergamo tour guide we were taken to this place for lunch otherwise we would never have found it.

Our guide recommended the local ravioli which was sensational

Weather was great so eating outdoors was no issue. We were lucky we timed our arrival so that there was no wait for a table. Otherwise there was quite a wait for late comers

Great,"We never eat near Duomo or Galleria as too touristy for us. However whenever I arrive in Milan I must see Duomo as soon as I can. And we were hungry so happy to drop into a table and eat

The vongole was fabulous and service was efficient and friendly

Would we eat there again, yes we would",September 2018,Biffi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187849-d1541347-Reviews-Biffi-Milan_Lombardy.html,"Milan, Italy",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Beyond expectations,"I guess you get what you pay for but in this instance you get more. The staff are amazing. They welcome you each time you walk by lobby. The staff at the bar are the same, always welcoming. Even door staff downstairs are amazingly friendly.

Additionally the staff were great in arranging skip the line tours and arranging a trip outside of Milano for the day. The staff arranged the day tour the night before which was a big ask during fashion week.

The room was a great size and housekeeping were also fabulous

Cocktails and food at bamboo bar was excellent.

I guess it has to be done,I am wondering what the big deal is as I have seen some amazing sunsets many places around the world. Still trying to figure out why people line up for hours before hand to watch sunset and then clap when it’s done?????,September 2018,Sunset in Oia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482941-d3369820-Reviews-Sunset_in_Oia-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice villa great sunset lovely staff,"Found the bed awkward being in tight corner of room with no window light and small access to bed. But it’s just to sleep right? Air conditioning didn’t quite make it to the bed area so found the night time sleeps a tad warm and uncomfortable

However the staff made up for the bed issue as they were so accomodating and even housekeeping was a lovely young lass who did a fabulous job and with such a lovely smile.

I am not a fan of Santorini as I found it with too many people and too far up from the water as I love to be in the water not look at it.

However if you are a fan of Santorini I would recommend Fanari Villas",September 2018,Fanari Villas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482941-d278859-Reviews-Fanari_Villas-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,4.0,5.0
Food tour was with Carolina,"Wow, what a day. Carolina is so passionate and knows her city so well.

I lost count on different items we tasted but the outstanding was the yoghurt (sheeps milk) with honey and walnuts. So memorable I hope to find same back in Melbourne.

The spoon desserts with coffee were also memorable and I will try to get recipe for the spiced walnuts - so yum.

The whole day was super and I would do that tour again.

Great service,"We were on a tour so no choice of booking hotels. This was a fabulous choice. Loved being near the beach.

Lovely water views too.

The manager and staff were amazing and went beyond call of duty as I was really sick with flu

The breakfast choices were fabulous. I can see how families with kids would be beside themselves with the choice of kids activities too.

I would return here and I would highly recommend this resort.",September 2018,Lemnos Village Resort Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189478-d655341-Reviews-Lemnos_Village_Resort_Hotel-Lemnos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lemnos, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5

Amazing works on display,But we expect the art work to be amazing. The crowds drove me mad - fear of missing out (fomo) is driving me to distraction at these galleries with people pushing and shoving and right on your back. So I didn’t enjoy the viewing of the amazing artwork that I had thought I would- so it’s my issue and i will work on that.

A must visit,"What a perfect find and luckily 1.00pmish so we scored a table on a busy Sunday afternoon.

The waiter was very professional and gracious. The menu was amazing and I hadn’t had any steak for a few weeks so the fillet was in order. Was cooked to perfection with fabulous salad.

Beyond expectations,"Well we didn’t realise how large this museum was, how far back technology and science it took us back to and where we are today and look at the future.

It’s a must visit. There is 12 acres of museum, we will return to the museum and allow at least half a day to enjoy in more detail and not so rushed

Perfect lunch with a view,"We were recommended by our hotel to have lunch here. I first thought when we were seated with best view of Duomo that the food would be substandard- I was wrong

Service was amazing and the food was fresh and stunning and the wines to match was added bonus.

Deserts were also stunning particularly the Bomba.

I would recommend lunch here and enjoy the stunning view of duomo at same time",September 2018,Giacomo Arengario,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187849-d1999901-Reviews-Giacomo_Arengario-Milan_Lombardy.html,"Milan, Italy",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Very interesting,"Enjoyed visiting the gallery with much renaissance art work that we didn’t expect to see.

Overgrown unkept disappointing gardens,"The €10 should be spent on maintaining the gardens which need weeding or mowing, no plants to mention, some sculptures completely neglected and water features dirty and unkept.

Could be stunning if anyone cared as it appears no one spends any time maintaining what could be a fabulous feature.

The only wow factor was the views from the garden at the porcelain museum of the countryside outside of the gardens.

Loved it,"Disappointed at some of the reviews here. It is not fine dining and if you want menu’s in English, then dine the tourist side of the river and have hamburgers.

We found it fun trying to translate some of the menu, as some we understood. So stuck to the handwritten menu as that is the fresh specials and the pasta alla vongole was the best we have had. The prosciutto e melone was also fresh and refreshing.

Great prices and great home style cooking, service was ok and we have no gripes and will be back again

Speechless,"Sadly only a one night stay but a great introduction to Hydra - and I will be back

Hotel Leto is full of charm. Reception and courtyard is amazingly elegant and dreamy. I felt so lost in a different world.

Room was great size and what views.

Funnily enough it was the day/night of no power, which just added to the charm of how lovely the locals reacted to the issue. Made me realise how badly Australians would have behaved blaming hotel owners of lack of power, food, air con etc. We found it disappointing for businesses as they lost fresh produce and potential revenue.

Fabulous lunch,"We were recommended to go to Anchovy and we were not disappointed.

Menu was so interesting we shared 3 starters between the 2 of us, and then shared the garfish and sand crab with curry leaf and salted duck egg - to die for.

Waitress was fabulous and even suggested the matching wine which worked very well with all that we ate

Very fashionable decor and fit out. Very well thought out. Loved it

Very quiet at night too. Slept well

Yes I will be back. Highly recommend this hotel.",November 2017,Veriu Broadway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255060-d12318566-Reviews-Veriu_Broadway-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Fabulous food and service,"Loved the 5 course meal. Very interesting flavours (as expected) but also great size meals for a 5 course meal

Service was exceptional with every dish explained in detail and not overly done

Lovely atmosphere too.

Oh - and well priced and awesome wine list

A must visit - you won't regret it",October 2017,Tulum Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255100-d10267319-Reviews-Tulum_Restaurant-Melbourne_Victoria.html,"Melbourne, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Embarrassing- so awful on every item,"Seriously what has happened to Lygon St in recent years. Took friends from interstate to Lygon St and we chose Carmines

Started with odd tasting gin and tonic. Foul tasting whiskey too. We should have paid and left.

The food had odd taste too. All four of our dishes. The pasta was lacking something - can't pin point what. My husband had lamb shanks and he said it was horrible and didn't taste like lamb. The other person had schnitzel- dried and tasteless

Creme brulee was horrible and again had an odd taste to it.

None of our dishes were finished

Price was extremely high especially for the food quality

Restaurant was empty all night. As was Lygon St.

Keep away from Lygon St. Melbourne CBD has AMAZING Italian restaurants - don't waste your time here",October 2017,Carmine's Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255100-d6885318-Reviews-Carmine_s_Bistro-Melbourne_Victoria.html,"Melbourne, Australia",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Lovely rooftop for a Saturday afternoon,"Nice and quiet rooftop for a quiet drink. Lovely atmosphere

The girls behind the bar appear to have no experience though. She didn't know what Campari was and when I asked for a lager on tap she didn't know what beers were a lager

Then took a long time to make my Campari -

Very disappointing as I was a bar girl and found that very odd.

Having said that, my bestie and I still enjoyed a few quiet hours and left as DJ harked up the music and the crowd changed",August 2017,The Republic Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d5990762-Reviews-The_Republic_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,4.0,4.0
Awesome and inspirational,"Friend suggested we went here as they had been before. I was hesitant when I saw a long queue as I dint queue to eat. Ever.

So Jason got our names down for a table of 3 and was handed a vibrating device to notify us when table was ready.

We then wandered the grounds and I was quietly impressed. The small stalls offered a variety of tasty treats or drinks. The other cafes weren't open but looked amazing. The market was OK.

We bought take ways coffees at a stall.

We then were buzzed and made our way to the cafe and table. My friends had breakfast burger I had the Bircher muesli with fresh berries. It was lovely

The presentation for the chai latte was memorable and tasty

I have already recommended friends to visit the grounds of Alexandria so you must go",August 2017,The Grounds of Alexandria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d2653321-Reviews-The_Grounds_of_Alexandria-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Everyone should do this at least once,"Such an amazing event with high energy even if you walk it.

Well organised and the 14 kms is entertaining and great views

Always great weather

Will be back again next year",August 2017,City2Surf Australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d10020266-Reviews-City2Surf_Australia-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Overrated,"Service was appallingly slow and the barman almost had the attitude of ""you should be grateful I am serving you""

It was awful. And there are plenty of rooftop bars in Sydney with views and better service

I would never recommend anyone to go. I actually would suggest don't go.",August 2017,Hotel Palisade,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255060-d583800-Reviews-Hotel_Palisade-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",hotels,2.0,4.0
Love love these,"Been before to SF and on cable cars before but had to go again.

Worth the cost - even get a day pass I think USD17 would be worth it.

Having said this - we caught the car at 7am so no crowds which added to the charm. Conductor chatty too

Got of at Lombard St - walked down and back up, caught car again at top of Lombard St - gorgeous

Love these and you should all go for a ride - try to avoid the crowds and get up early.",June 2017,Powell and Market Cable Car Turnaround,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d3670548-Reviews-Powell_and_Market_Cable_Car_Turnaround-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.0
Great fish and chips,"Sourdough batter and freshly battered - yum. Chips great too.

Chowder looked extremely popular.

Windy sunny cold day and even eating inside was cold due to wind. Only downside

Restrooms line far too long and found rest of viewing irritable so left the pier - but great fish and chips",June 2017,Chowders,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d2315407-Reviews-Chowders-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",restaurants,4.0,4.0
