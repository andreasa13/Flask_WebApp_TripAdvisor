Roger & Anne Fogg,"We have just returned after 2 fantastic weeks in one of the beach bungalows (1040)
On arrival at the hotel we were taken from the main reception to our beach bungalow - we must say it surpassed our expectations, it was beautiful, very clean and right on the beach
The staff were so friendly and intent on making sure our holiday was memorable for all the right reasons
We were all inclusive and we could have anything we wanted served direct to our patio where the table was laid every day by the wonderful staff
We would like to mention in particular Kamel, Head waiter alongside Moez, Rabii and Hamza - all who couldn’t do enough for us. Also the the 2 girls who cleaned our bungalow and the beach security staff. Many beach activities, parasailing etc by Ramsey and his crew Safety was never a concern with discreet and unobtrusive Police presence.
If we have any slight comment, it would be about the food. It was on the whole very good but lacked consistency and we had to ask often what we would like - they were then more than willing to try to please
Overall we would give it our definite recommendation and suggest to them they book the bungalow for that special service and location - it’s well worth it !
Our thanks to all and we hope to return when possible",July 2019,The Orangers Beach Resort & Bungalows,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297943-d306872-Reviews-The_Orangers_Beach_Resort_Bungalows-Hammamet_Nabeul_Governorate.html,"Hammamet, Tunisia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Sunday Lunch,"Myself and family arrived for Sunday Lunch today, showed to our favourite table immediately
Lovely waitress brought drinks straight away whilst we waited for meals which were brought in good time and were delicious. 3 roasts and 1 vegetarian
All were cooked to perfection, hot colourful vegetables cooked as we like them and the roasts pink, hot and tender with tasty gravy. Risotto perfect, hot and moist

All in all a lovely lunch, well priced and in a lovely renovated black and white town centre hotel bar and grill

Would certainly recommend",October 2018,Crown Hotel Bar and Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g499514-d9792494-Reviews-Crown_Hotel_Bar_and_Grill-Nantwich_Cheshire_England.html,"Nantwich, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Mexican Caribbean Holiday,"We arrived at El Dorado Sensimar Seaside Suites and were immediately aware of the beautiful surroundings, tropical gardens and palms shielding the mainly low rise buildings and the amazing white sandy beach. We had a beach front junior suite with jacuzzi which had towel sculptures on arrival and every day. There were many varied a la carte restaurants, gourmet dining with beach front barbecue and bars. Personal concierge Ula and Emilio were magnificent, as well as Angel (Antonio Banderas) beach barbecue waiter and Mario from Room Service.

Pet Shop Boys,"We had a superior double room which was lovely, clean and spacious with an excellent bathroom with large shower. Location is very good for the centre of the old town, palazzos and shops.
Staff on the whole were friendly and helpful. My only criticism is if the Manageress who was rude, arrogant and unapologetic for a mistake she made following an email sent by me that was very precise !
I would recommend however the hotel",August 2017,Hotel La Luna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187898-d195715-Reviews-Hotel_La_Luna-Lucca_Province_of_Lucca_Tuscany.html,"Lucca, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0

Birthday Celebration,"Well what a surprise.
Organised by my son and daughter in law for my wife's 60th Birthday!
What a great place from the moment we walked in and greeted.
Fabulous restaurant and bar downstairs and all choices of food open to view as we're the fired ovens. Upstairs got even better with a roof terrace bar and restaurant and crowning glory of a music lounge restaurant with live music provided on Sundays by a band of black singers and musicians who were fantastic.
Food was fantastic and reasonably priced - choice was extensive !
Staff were very friendly, amusing and skilled at their respective duties.
Would not hesitate in recommending the Opera Grill, Chester to anyone looking for that extra something and thanks to my son and daughter in law for making it a day to remember for my wife

Anniversary,"We booked the hot tub cottage suite. We found the cottage overall to be very nice with log fire and new hot tub. However there were some bad points that were rectified when brought to the attention of the hotel staff. The food in the bistro and fig restaurant was absolutely delicious and service impeccable.
The hotel has undergone considerable refurbishment and whilst there were a few remaining things to be done, I enjoyed our time there celebrating our special wedding anniversary.

Roger & Anne Fogg,"Fantastic 2 week all inclusive stay. Weather and location were fantastic as was the hotel having upgraded to room 405 - beach front bungalow.
The staff were in the main very friendly and helpful mentioning Panos, Blue Bar and Aris, Main Restaurant and occasionally Pool Bar. The food was good, especially having spoken to George and Chef Tasos who both went out of their way to add that special touch. Eleonora in the Activity Team was an absolute joy.
The room 405 was fantastic, right on the beach front and near to both sea and pool. I'm sorry to say that some of the Pool Bar staff did not live up to their colleagues which was a pity.
All in all, a great time and we would definitely stay there again",September 2015,Blue Sea Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g644210-d1173937-Reviews-Blue_Sea_Beach-Stalis_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
