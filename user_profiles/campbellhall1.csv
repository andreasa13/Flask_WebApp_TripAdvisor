Great Airport Transfers,"We used them for airport transfers to & from our hotel without the sightseeing tour, and was pleased with the service. Our driver, John, drove us for both transfers and he was very pleasant & on time. He offered us bottled water and had hand sanitizer for us to use on both trips. He gave us an overview of Athens and gave recommendations when asked.

Great Museum,It's a must stopover after visiting the Acropolis on the hill. This is where the collection of the artifacts are kept to preserve them for future generations. An excellent display of the history of ancient Athens.

Majestic,"The city on top of the hill is more than just the Parthenon. There are numerous ruins of structures and architectural wonders to see.

#1 Site in Athens,How is this the #2 site??? People come from all over the world to see this. It was built on top of a hill over 1000 years ago so people could see it out at sea and afar.

So much Food,"I think this was the first time in my life that I never ate all my french fries!!!
To be fair, we weren't extremely hungry, when we entered but it was 8pm and wanted to eat something before drinking. We ordered greek salads, an eggplant appetizer, and gyros. The volume of food that came out of that kitchen and onto our tables was astounding. The pricetag for that food would have been at least double in NY. The eggplant app must have been 2 whole eggplants cut up & fried. The gyro platter could not fit on a normal plate, so it was placed in front of me on a round silver pizza platter. Must of been over 1.lb of fries. It was all delicious & very reasonably priced.",March 2020,Gioti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10284605-Reviews-Gioti-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Greek Diner,"Postscript or PS, it's the same restaurant. The least expensive meal we had in Greece. And it was great. It reminded me of the Greek Diners in NY. The menu looked the same way.

Great Restaurant,"This restaurant was close to our hotel, and we wanted to try it as soon as we saw it. We were pleased. I ordered the steak and my wife ordered the shrimp.

Very Good Hotel,"Overall I thought the Stanley was a very good hotel. I was dismayed that the rooftop bar/restaurant was closed, because there was no prior posting of the construction, when we booked. But it did have another restaurant and room service. The hotel offered a complimentary breakfast which was very good with many greek & american food items to choose from. The rooms were clean, and the Metro station was right on the corner. There were many food choices & restaurants in the immediate area, which we ate at a different one each nite. Some reviews questioned the safeness of the are, and that was not my experience. I feel those people are not used to urban settings. It was a densely populated traffic area but not a criminal element one. The only thing to be aware of is the traffic. Lots of small cars & motorcycles racing around the traffic circle with little regard to traffic rules(red lights) made crossing the streets an interesting challenge. But once across the intersection I had no worries.",March 2020,The Stanley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d233051-Reviews-The_Stanley-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Great Stop at the end of the Day,"This place is right next door to our hotel, so we stopped here every night before retiring to treat ourselves. It is open 24 hours. We only tried the pastries/desserts, so I can't comment on any of their other food, but it all looked delicious, which all the pastries were. Black Forest cake, Tiramisu, Chocolate Eclairs, Opera Cake (greek tiramisu),Fruit Tart Cake, & a variety of Cheesecakes and cookies, we tried them all and they were all great. Some previous reviews stated the staff were rude, we didn't experience that, but I think I know why people feel that way. In the food industry in the USA, they work for tips & give a little extra attention/smile to cater to the consumer. In Europe, they don't give you that fake smile, but they still do their job. Every time I entered the BF, someone was helping within 5 minutes, they didn't smile or make suggestions, but they waited patiently until I made my decision. I'm good with that.",March 2020,Bread Factory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d11816586-Reviews-Bread_Factory-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"""Coffin"" Inn","There are many positive aspects for this hotel, but the MAIN drawback is the size of the rooms & the narrow hallways. First the positives, the staff was very helpful & accommodating. The hotel was very clean from the rooms, dining area, reception & halls. The continental breakfast, which is included, was a great way to start the day. Great location, near the Tube, and at a great price. Now the rooms. I read the reviews & stayed in European hotels before; so I know or thought I knew what to expect, especially since the ""Comfort Inn"" brand name is so widely known in the USA to have a certain level of comfortableness.. If we stayed only a nite, it would have sufficed, however we stayed for a week, and all I could think of ""what if"" a fire or some other disaster would have occurred. All would be lost. There is only 1 way in & 1 way out, and the hallways were so narrow that a 'bloke' with wide shoulders would have to walk sideways to get to his room. Hopefully no one would be walking in the opposite direction. No fire exits/escapes above the ground floor. We had 5 persons and stayed in 3 doublebed rooms. All were the same. There was a small cubby to put some clothes items. It was the size of a school locker. I let my wife use it, so I had to live out of my suitcase for a week. But there is no place to put the suitcase, so I had to leave it in the walking path and step over it when getting in & out of bed. The bathrooms were small too, there was no room to move in the entire rooms or hotel. I would advise anyone who is considering staying here to really consider the duration of your stay, and pay extra for the larger rooms. And hope a fire doesn't occur.",January 2020,Comfort Inn Hyde Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d215296-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Hyde_Park-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,3.5

"Definitively an ""All in 1"" tour","Was that a tourist tour or did we attend a college seminar on Brussels/Belgium history, culture, cuisine, art, architecture,..etc? We came into Brussels for a day trip from London, and wanted to get the most of our short stay. Well we got what we paid for.
Avo was amazing, and the information was at times overwhelming. I came to Brussels thinking what a quaint beautiful city, and upon departure, falling in love with Brussels & wanting to return. Avo walked us around the city, stopping frequently to tell us about Brussels' history..etc.. We gave us an education on chocolate tasting, beer tasting, waffles and showed us the tourist hot 'spots' & the hidden 'spots' down Brussels' alleyways, which we never would have discovered on our own. We experienced too much to list in this review, which is a testament of how much this tour offers. Highly recommend this tour if you have the time as it does take 5.5-6 hours.
One tip, do not add a 'mixer' to the whisky portion of the tour. We had 4 women in our group who do not drink it straight, when they did, I believe it upset Avo.

Excellent Service,"We utilized 'London Travel In' for our airport transfers between LHR and our Hyde Park Hotel. The driver was waiting for us upon arrival, asked us if we needed any assistance or we had any questions since we were 'first timers' in London. He was very helpful.

Lantern Tour,"Unfortunately the elevators were out; so we couldn't do the main tours that were usually offered. However, we visited the Visitor Center and took the Lantern Tour. The Visitor Center was very informative, and prepared us for the lantern tour. We had to drive a mile down the road to begin the tour, but it was worth it. The tour itself was great. After a short hike we entered the cave, and our tour guide locked us in by securing a metal gate across the entrance with a lock. Not initially understanding as to why he was doing that, he explained that not only did that prevent any animals wandering in while we were inside, it also prevented people from leaving without first disinfecting their shoes. The tour led us underground utilizing very narrow staircases and having to 'duck' down while walking beneath rock ledges. The only light down there was from the lanterns which we were carrying.

Fantastic Drive,"I knew when I started the trip that it was gonna be a good drive, but it was more than that. A one way narrow dirt road that hugs the mountain with sheer drop-offs was a great adrenaline rush to see spectacular views.

Great Lunch,"We stopped here during our stay in Estes Park just to visit the Hotel which inspired Stephen King, but we stayed for lunch anyway. We were not disappointed. Even though we thought it was a little bit expensive, the steak and salad entrees were delicious. The hotel and grounds are worth a visit, and while you're there stop in the restaurant.

We didn't plan on eating pizza when we were on vacation but we got back late one night and just wanted to stay in our room. I walked over to the parlor, and spoke with the owner, who is from NY.

Very Good Motel near RMNP,"This Motel does have a lot of amenities to offer; however some are dated. The hot tub was very large but it and the room needs a little TLC. When we visited the motel, it was not very busy; however they kept putting the clients together. In our section, there were about 15 units, and we were assigned a unit right next to another couple at the very end of the section.. However, the rest of our section was empty. When that couple checked out the next day, another couple checked in and was given the same unit, when the entire section was empty.

"Birthday Dinner @ Eiffel, What more!!","I booked a dinner here for my wife's 50th birthday & was very pleased. The ambiance & the views were great. The service was great. The food was very fine dining & not what I am used to. So it was more about the presentation than the quantity. Duck pate was not my favorite but at least I can say I tried it.

Not what I expected,"We traded our timeshare to stay at The WELK resort & expected a top notch experience. Boy were we wrong. We reserved an A unit over 6 months in advance but when we checked in they gave us a B unit, which is smaller. We protested & showed them the confirmation, but no avail. They blamed RCI & RCI blamed them. We were stuck with the B unit. When we went inside, it was dirty, not even cleaned. The kitchen sink backed up because the garbage disposal was clogged. Maintenance had to be called. The bed in the bedroom had a lopsided mattress. Midweek, we heard housecleaning outside the door & thought they we making the rounds. When I told them we would be out of their way in a minute, they informed us that our unit was not even scheduled to be cleaned. That was quickly addressed. For us the best part of the resort, was the adult pool. The other pools were kaos with screaming kids. We were able to relax & enjoy the surroundings there. We are not golf players; and that is a big part of the resort. It was a short drive to downtown Escondido, and not too far from San Diego, where we made several day trips.

FRIENDS set was worth it,"For me I would have liked if the guide talked more about the older Warner Bros movies that were made here. Instead he kept to current or recently cancelled TV shows. He seemed to be an expert on the Gilmore girls, which only 1 person in our group knew anything about them. But my teenage daughters love Friends & were able to take part in a Friends skit, which excited them. This made my day.

Great for the curious explorer,"I knew Tijuana is really not my type of town, but when I was visiting S.D., I had to check it out. I didn't want to pay alot for a tour & nor did I want walk around with just a map. This was the perfect tour. Fernando was an excellent guide. He knew alot of the history of the people & different parts of Mexico. He took us to the cultural center, to the shopping district & best of all Tacos. We ate before coming, but he assured us that we never had Tacos so good. He was right. I tried the pork & beef tacos & they were the best I have ever eaten. The day before I visited Old Town in SD & had what I thought were authentic Mexican Tacos. I was wrong. Best part of the trip. The only complaint I had was when we were visiting the markets. He gave us time to shop on our own, which was fine when shopping for souvenirs. However in the food market, I would have liked a guide to show us the different foods. We were walking around aimlessly in a foreign country, not knowing what we were looking at. I saw another group in the food market & their guide was with them explaining all the different foods & making recommendations of what to try. Other than that, I highly recommend the walking tour.",July 2018,Tijuana Walking Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60750-d17462464-Reviews-Tijuana_Walking_Tour-San_Diego_California.html,"San Diego, California",attractions,4.0,5.0

Nice place to get a bite to Eat,"We were visiting friends nearby & we all decided to go out to eat. There wasn't much of a selection for a sit down dining experience; so we chose Carini. Our meals were very tasty. We ordered a stromboli, buffalo wings, mercato salads,and Tortalini soups. It wasn't a fancy dining establishment, but we weren't looking for that either.

Great Food; Lousy service,"Our second time dining at Gilligan's & the same experience 'Great seafood; Lousy service'. First the food, always get the single lobster dish. The calamari appetizer was excellent. While there was only 3 clams in the lobster pot, it was loaded with mussels & a whole lobster. The best p[art is the juice at the bottom of the bowl to be eaten with bread. Now the service. As luck would have it we got Karen again, who is pleasant 'enough' but she is disinterested & could care less if you have a good experience there or not. Her friends were seated at a table next to us & she sat down with them & chatted away while we waited for drinks, bread..etc. She said they were short on busboys but the busboys weren't the problem. Maybe because there were 9 of us & the tip was added to the bill already; so she felt she didn't have to try. I hope the management reads this because this is the second time.

Great Flight,"This was an enjoyable flight with Jetblue. There was a delay because of storms down south; however, I was notified immediately because I signed up for their alerts on my phone. Entertainment, snacks, & drinks were good. However, for the last couple flights with them; they are always requesting passengers to check their carry-ons. And most people do not want to do it. This causes delay & stress when boarding.
If a passenger doesn't have a checked bag waiting at baggage claim; then checking a carry-on would be an added inconvenience.
Just announce that ALL passengers will have to place their carry-on bags in the ""measurement display"" at the gate WHILE boarding. If it doesn't fit they will be charged, or they can voluntary check it for free BEFOREHAND at the gate.
Then MAKE everyone place their bag in that ""measurement display"". The size of bags people carry-on is ridiculous nowadays",March 2018,JetBlue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729099-Reviews-JetBlue,"Long Island City, New York",flights,4.0,4.0

Free Drinks???,"I'm not a big gambler, mostly play the slots or the video poker at the bar. Every once in a blue moon I'll try my luck at Blackjack. But to me the trade off of donating my hard earned money to the casino is to get free drinks in return. When my party decided to go to Harrahs, I sat down at the slots, put in my Total Rewards card, started to play & requested my 1st drink via the machine. The waitress came and requested $$, and informed me that the slots are 50% off for drinks. You can only get free drinks at the tables. The staff was friendly & helpful.

This time they were nasty, and when I left I wished I went somewhere else. The food also was lacking. The fried pickles were loaded with salt.

Frugal Way to get around,"We used Uber to get from the airport to the hotel, after that we used streetcars & buses. Very inexpensive, $3 to ride all day. Only drawback was on the St Charles line, which goes to garden district, was always behind schedule. All tourists use that line because that line has the old style cars & the destination. However, no one buys their ticket ahead of time, and each person has to put exact change into the meter. Twenty people putting 3 singles at a time takes time. At each stop. And if another trolley catches up in the meantime, it can't pass, the whole line backs up. The canal line & the riverfront line was a great way around the quarter.

Loved the O.G.,"In almost every tourist magazine or website for New Orleans, you can find a coupon for 10% for the OG. I assumed because of this it must be mediocre food/place. I was wrong. I enjoyed my dining experience at the OG. We sat in the courtyard by the fountain, and ordered the blackened alligator, po-boy alligator & a seafood combo meal. It was all excellent but the best of all was the blackened alligator appetizer. I wasn't sure at first, but the waitress convinced me to try it, and I'm sure glad I did.

Always Good......except for that 1 time,"I & my family have flown Jetblue many times & never had a complaint. Always on time, courteous staff & ease of checking in. On our trip back from Cuba this summer we had an all day ordeal. My main complaint was the lack of communication from Jetblue to their customers. Thunderstorms in FLA shutdown Ft Lauderdale Airport so we were stuck in Havana for hours. Nothing anyone could do, but wait. However, waiting without word or information was frustrating. When we were able to fly we landed in FLA for our connecting flight to ALB., and the airport shutdown again for hours. This time not only was there a lack of information, the information that was given was false. They kept telling us ""it'll only be a half-hour more or the plane is being cleaned at another gate & we have to wait"". It was apparent we were being lied to. We were getting better info from their website than the representatives at the Terminal. In the absence of authority, chaos ensued. Hundreds of angry travelers yelling at the poor counter people.

However on Xmas eve our family of 17 people went there for dinner, and it didn't impress. I know it was a busy nite, but when half of the table have to constantly get up & go to the bar for drinks, the wait staff should've took notice & corrected their service. The veal dishes were good, no complaints there. Plenty of bread. However, five of the dishes were the scallops, which was the special. Two of the five served had a smell of ammonia, which means they were old. How does a chef serve that. The waitress & manger were very pleasant & accommodating, which stopped a bad situation from becoming worse. But I'm on the fence on whether to return.

Not as promised,"We were taken here after an Old Car tour, which I believe the driver got some kind of kickback, and we were told that it was one of Havana's best. Well it wasn't. The wait staff seemed annoyed that we didn't have a reservation, but there was plenty of tables. They gave us wooden bowls & cups still dripping with water. They told us that meant they were just cleaned. But their water makes us sick!! So no one drank from cups. I had the Ropa Vieja, which was good, but the rest of the meals were subpar & not as promised. We ordered the fried bananas with our meals, but they forgot them & they came with the check, which was wrong(extra items not ordered). They were pushing cigars & bar drinks on us. We don't smoke & we are not drunken sailors. One or two drinks with dinner is more our speed. The waitress got more rude as the night went on. I would not recommend this place & it wasn't even on my list on places to eat while in Havana. But I made the mistake of listening to the recommendation of my car driver. After reading the other reviews, it seems that is the scam for this place.
I hope he got a good kickback.",July 2017,El Guajirito,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147271-d1633948-Reviews-El_Guajirito-Havana_Ciudad_de_la_Habana_Province_Cuba.html,Cuba,restaurants,2.0,3.5
Nice stop on walking tour,"This was one of our stops on the walking tour & it was pleasant. There were street performers, old buildings, post office & a lot of history, which our guide informed us about. We didn't go inside the church, but it was beautiful from the outside.",July 2017,San Francisco de Asis Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147271-d207820-Reviews-San_Francisco_de_Asis_Square-Havana_Ciudad_de_la_Habana_Province_Cuba.html,Cuba,attractions,4.0,4.5
Fun Statue,"This statue & the other street performers posing as statues adds to the fun atmosphere of the San Francisco plaza. It's funny to see all the tourists really believe that you will have good luck if you pose in a silly stance with one hand on his beard; one hand on his finger; & one foot on his foot. The Cuban who came up with that tale is laughing everyday at all the dumb tourists, who actually do it. But it all in good fun",July 2017,Monument of the Street Person,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147271-d7240758-Reviews-Monument_of_the_Street_Person-Havana_Ciudad_de_la_Habana_Province_Cuba.html,Cuba,attractions,4.0,4.0
