Belated Valentine's Day dinner,"Couldn't get a reservation until Sunday so enjoyed a belated dinner. I had the 8 oz. filet, my husband ordered 12 oz. ribeye and we shared au gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus. I had banana cream pie for dessert while hubby had raspberry sorbet, with decaf in a French press for both of us. Good bread to start. My steak was perfect but my husband's medium arrived stringy and well done. We summoned the server who immediately wisked it to the kitchen for a replacement. The new steak was thicker, juicy and perfectly cooked. The manager delivered it personally. He even offered to have a new one cooked for me so that we could eat together but I assured him that wasn't necessary. It is unfortunate that a piece of meat was wasted, but we were pleased with the prompt attention to our complaint. The ambiance is lovely, the service excellent and problem-solving immediate. We will definitely dine here again.",February 2020,Ruth's Chris Steak House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49092-d1533091-Reviews-Ruth_s_Chris_Steak_House-Durham_North_Carolina.html,"Durham, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Excellent Dinner,"I had eaten here for brunch with my daughter a couple of years ago and loved it. My husband and I decided to have our date night dinner here to try someplace new. We were absolutely delighted with the whole experience. The casual ambiance, the excellent service and the wonderful food made us very happy. I had the mixed berry salad with fried oysters as an added protein. Really delicious! Then had the pan-fried trout on cheese grits with bacon braised kale. Wow! Wonderful flavors. Conservative husband was delighted with spinach salad with oysters, his pork loin, mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. This place is definitely going into date night rotation!!",August 2019,Harvest 18,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49092-d6473745-Reviews-Harvest_18-Durham_North_Carolina.html,"Durham, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Overrated steak but still a nice dining experience,"We earned $40 off second entree through Dine Reward so we were very excited to try Flemings at long last. Got there at 5:15 and were the only guests for about 30 minutes, then it became busy. We ordered filet mignon medium, split a Flemings salad, and shared mushrooms and roasted asparagus. Good bread with two flavored butters. The meal started off well, with bread and salad, mushrooms and asparagus fine, too. My steak tasted pretty good at first but became tougher and stringier as I continued eating. It was definitely overcooked and possibly an inferior piece of meat. I was very disappointed and should have sent it back, but kept on chewing. Definitely overrated and highly expensive restaurant. We won't be back. Total bill with $40 discount was $121.27 + tip.",August 2019,Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55229-d2017354-Reviews-Fleming_s_Prime_Steakhouse_Wine_Bar-Nashville_Davidson_County_Tennessee.html,"Nashville, Tennessee",restaurants,3.0,4.5

70th Anniversary of the Navajo Art and Culture Fair,"Our visit happily coincided with a weekend of celebration of the 70th Anniversary of Navajo Art and Culture, held on the grounds of the museum and with artisan booths inside as well.

Great vestige of an ancient civilization,"We combined a day trip to Sunset Crater and then Wupatki National Monument as they are 30-40 minutes apart.

These ruins are a reminder of the migratory people who lived here when the soil supported their crops and who moved on when it became less fertile.",August 2019,Wupatki National Monument,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60971-d108883-Reviews-Wupatki_National_Monument-Flagstaff_Arizona.html,"Flagstaff, Arizona",attractions,5.0,4.5

Morrocan Salmon and Couscous,"We traveled to Flagstaff and ate the Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen in Terminal A and it was so good we ate at the Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen in Terminal C on the way home. We had fried oysters going which were delicious, and salmon on the way back. My husband had the Cedar Baked Salmon with asparagus and I had the Moroccan Salmon with couscous. Both were excellent: well-prepared and tasty. We remembered how great Pappadeaux is from a trip through the Houston airport a couple of years ago.
