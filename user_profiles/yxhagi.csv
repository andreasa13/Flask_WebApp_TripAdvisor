Too expensive!,"Once in a life time visit.

Free shuttle buses to two separate places,"Cruise terminal is located just like airport terminal next to the cruise ship. (As a matter of fact prior to the cruise terminal it was an airport facility including runway, as I learned.) Out of cruise terminal one free shuttle bus to a shopping mall which we took. Another one brings up a hill place. Both were free. It was the first day of CNY 2020 celebration, we went a dim sum restaurant. After about an hour waiting, we had a sitting table and chair. A dim sum branch was great, but ended in a relatively expensive meal. It was very difficult to communicate in English. We experienced similar dim sum lunch a number of times in the past which made us a bit easy.",January 2020,Kai Tak Cruise Terminal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294217-d4759986-Reviews-Kai_Tak_Cruise_Terminal-Hong_Kong.html,"Hong Kong, China",attractions,4.0,3.5
Very convenient for airport connections.,"Our last stay in Italy was Hilton at FCO again as we did our first arrival day, but was told my reservation had been canceled by someone else, just after arrived in from Florence. Discovering the money I paid for two months ago was sucked by a service company, Very humiliating by the internet base service provider (recommend to use Exp..Hotels.com, Booking.com). I had to repay once more. This time, of course, directly.
It was worthwhile as its location is the best. A reasonable buffet breakfast, though no sparkling wine, included. Our last long over 12 hours flight was delayed so the hotel accepted longer stay without penalty. We will definitely stay again.",November 2019,Hilton Rome Airport Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g656615-d228406-Reviews-Hilton_Rome_Airport_Hotel-Fiumicino_Province_of_Rome_Lazio.html,"Fiumicino, Italy",hotels,5.0,3.5

Reconstruction underway next thousands years! Watch for pickpockets.,"On our shore excursion trip to and from Athen’s cruise port, we took bus, train, subway and walk to Acropolis.
1. A couple looks like from Morocco approached us with a widely opened map. We were also having a small map of how to get to the hill of Acropolis from a nearby Subway station. Since we took an opposite direction ( counterclockwise) we had to look around. A decently attired husband asked me something in English. I thought he was going to help me. Instead he put his body close to me, then his wife started to say something. My wife immediately pushed me aside away from the couple. I was saved from pickpocket.
2. On the way back we took a train from Acropolis STN. The train car gradually became full and just two stations before Marathon stadium (a big event at the stadium) it was so full as all pax bodies touched the others. When the train stopped one station before the stadium, my wife suddenly pulled my arm and got out of the car. I followed my wife and stood on the platform. Surprisingly, there was an old Greek (?) man standing by just next to me. I felt a bit strange, but I chased my wife who already inside of another car. I pulled my wife’s arm and brought her back in the same original car. There was the same old man next to me back in the car. Within a minute, a lady in front of us talked to me with Greek accent English (similar accent to my Greek student during my US college time) which somewhat made sense so I replied. Very soon the train stopped at the Marathon stadium - all crowded people got off. We two were left in the train soon arrived in the final destination and walked back to the cruise terminal. I became thirsty and picked up one beer can and tried to pay for the can of beer, I’d noticed, then, that my small coin holder from left hand side jean of front pocket is gone! A bit lucky it had only less than 20 euros. How smart the thief was amazingly. This was one of the funniest pickpocket experiences. The man had his hand in my jean pocket while I was standing at platform!

Better prepared for pickpocket! After this incident I attached a string for a coin holder.
Acropolis was the same condition of my previous visit a few months before the Athen Summer Olympics ant this place is for only one visit - 10 euros each. Note that washroom are available without entering the gate.",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,1.0,4.5
An excellent hotel with Champagne breakfast.,"Our last stop in Tuscany Florence was a wonderfully decorated in town hotel hard to pronounce Brunelleschi. The money well spent, minutes walk to Duomo and other places. The hotel guest service men were well seasoned English speakers. The breakfast was moderately provided with Prosecco, a bubbling white. No smoked salmon, which was an extra charge. Pecorino cheese was also very tasty, after tasting this Parmesan like cheese but from goat milk we kept looking for it and bought a few. Eating Pecorino cheese is just like wine tasting so Pecorino cheese in Siena and Pienza in our next trip agenda.
To be reminded taxi fares were not cheap, possibly City Taxi drivers brutality. It’s only less than 10 minutes walk from Florence SMN rail station. We will stay here again at our next trip - my third Tuscany visit. There was a small gym but no time to use it. Our one of the best memories of 2019 trip to Italy and Mediterranean countries.",November 2019,Brunelleschi Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187895-d202988-Reviews-Brunelleschi_Hotel-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
Was a good choice to stay one week waiting for a cruise ship,"We took a transient stay at Trastevere between Rome FCO and Rome cruise port of call Civitavecchia. It was a very convenient location: Piazza Venezia, Colosseum, Vatican, Spanish Steps, etc namely via a Tram #3 or #8. It was a better location than the previous accommodation at the east of Vatican nearly 17 years ago. We recommend Trastevere area for a short stay. A nice supermarket name DEM was close by. Highly recommend Trastevere. Train station was close to St. Peter...Civitavecchia.",November 2019,Trastevere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190123-Reviews-Trastevere-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5

Excellent paintings and statues,"This my 2nd visit was only 10 minutes waiting line, probably due to off season visit.

Don’t be fooled by a sales pitch of AirBnB Romantic Room with View of Val d'Orcia,"Montalcino and Montepulciano are one of the most beautiful places in the south of Siena. We were fooled by an AirBnB with ad of “Romantic Room with View of Val d'Orcia”. Stayed there for two nights but surprised to realize no breakfast, yet relatively expensive room charge. I drove a rental car from Civitavecchia Cruise Terminal, my 2nd time of driving Tuscany Region. The host was a male (and no lady as the ad shows) brought me to a free parking lot a mile away - very kindly - car parking in the village of Montalcino was very expensive! There were one room window and less than one square foot opening from the shower room. Yes, a nice view of Val d’Orcia, but a false information. A nearby eating place which was recommended by the host Simone was the worst compared to our longer than one month long tour in Rome, other Mediterranean towns and Tuscany! Surprised to see how small amount local wine it was?! Less than wine tasting. Only a few mouthful. We originally thought that it was only for taste check but no further pouring.
2nd day we drove to Montepulciano, a nice place, but the view wasn’t as good as Montalcino. A nice small restaurant operated by a young couple we found was excellent, a nominal amount of Montepulciano wine per a glass and raw ground beef, like a German style dish. My driving had been disturbed due to some kind of local car racing. There were many police, who couldn’t speak English, on the roads everywhere. Be advised to check any local events before heading to the area and not to be intimidated by such small car racers. Also be warned there are no highways like US & Canada in terms of road conditions. The belly side of our small car hit the middle of roads or higher level of country roads a quite often and luckily no damage to the bottom of car. I would highly recommend 1. Not to stay AirBnB with that “romantic view” - it’s on the 2nd floor and no elevator no breakfast despite a high overnight price, 2) be careful to drive around in-towns of Montalcino & Montepulciano, both hill top towns with narrow & steep local centuries old roads.",November 2019,Val d'Orcia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187893-d501842-Reviews-Val_d_Orcia-Tuscany.html,"Tuscany, Italy",attractions,3.0,5.0
An ancient traditional 3-4 century old hotel with a nice breakfast,"First day (room #2) we were put into possibly one of the oldest rooms with full bleach smell with antiquity leather chair which had many century dusts. The bathtub did not have a functional bus fan. The hotel provided aged blankets like army barracks, brown coloured. The air conditioner provided ran so noisy thus we had to turn it down. It did not provide a comfortable room condition and we had a sleepless night. The rugs around the bed was ancient and broken. We complained the hotel manager that the room is hard to stay over night. However, the manager proudly convinced this hotel is more than 3 century old and difficult to give a modernized room condition. If so seek another accommodations.There were big noises from the ceiling as if the upper room guests returned from a drinking party. it was 2 am midnight. The hotel kept saying all is fully occupied.
The 2nd night the room (#23) upstairs became available, the weekend is over. The new room upstairs was the one the midnight noise came from and we found more comfortable. A big change between the one last night. The bathroom had a window allowing required air quality exchange. The bed cover had a comfortable bed cover, similar to our Canadian “comforter”. The side tables were there and functional. No smell and clean. We were mad the difference between downstairs and upstairs. The guest service lady told that the previous guest had stayed 5 nights consecutively so a nice room, whereas you only two nights. I guessed despite our very earlier reservation the hotel squeezed us into an antiquity room which is unserviceable due to busy Saturday night.
The breakfast was well serviced. We had a car, but not mentioning their own parking lot!?",November 2019,Hotel Santa Caterina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187902-d236016-Reviews-Hotel_Santa_Caterina-Siena_Tuscany.html,"Siena, Italy",hotels,1.0,4.5
Great lamb,"We, two couples, visited an early July afternoon. Only one of the four was a wine lover, yet they enjoyed dessert wine with a double order of lamb shank and beet & lamb salad. The Chef must have taken a good hours to make one of the best lamb dishes that we all enjoyed. We ate a lot rather than drinking. The prices of their wines are moderate and there are some batches that produced only a few hundreds. I still keep a couple in my wine cellar so I can’t give the verdicts yet.",July 2019,Cherry Point Estate Wines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1392612-d5011707-Reviews-Cherry_Point_Estate_Wines-Cobble_Hill_Cowichan_Valley_Regional_District_Vancouve.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",attractions,5.0,4.5
The best and easy hiking trail in Ladysmith for all!,"A slightly challenging trail. Take left hand side of creek after Save on Foods store leading Heart Lake all the way, but normally turn back at the Bridge. This trail is especially recommended for individuals who’s never seen the Rain Forest of BC. You’ll encounter many local joggers and/or casual walkers with a dog or more during Saturdays and Sundays. The trail is well maintained, meaning you might hear the trail maintenance workers chain saws and bush cutters and likes weekdays. This is the one of the best hiking trails in Ladysmith. You won’t be able to see the sky, rain or shine. After the hike you feel as if you took Forrest Bathing, a Japanese natural therapy.",June 2019,Holland Creek Hiking Trails,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g182188-d5998719-Reviews-Holland_Creek_Hiking_Trails-Ladysmith_Cowichan_Valley_Regional_District_Vancouver.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",attractions,4.0,4.5
Hike up 3 hours to the reservoir when Mt. Baker is seen.,"The trail goes up southwesterly seeing Mt. Baker twice or so when the sky is blue, normally early May to June. When the Forrest fires are on in BC or western AB, not worthwhile take a hike. There are a couple of steep climbs and not so enjoyable to go up to the reservoir. Some dirty (hiking) dogs jump in the reservoir, which ironically allowed? A sign says, “no swimming allowed”, but dogs can’t read! It may be good for young and not experienced hikers (for endurance experience), but one who hiked many other places is boring.",June 2019,Stocking Creek Trail,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g182188-d10127139-Reviews-Stocking_Creek_Trail-Ladysmith_Cowichan_Valley_Regional_District_Vancouver_Islan.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",attractions,2.0,4.5
A blind tasting of apple cider / distilled liquor surrounded by apple trees,"We were amazed this exists not so far away from our house. Our first visit to this was excellent as there was only a few visitors beside two of us. A quite number of years passed since the first Apple cider tasting back in Massachusetts as we didn’t know the existence of this in Vancouver Island(VI). One thing we found is that no free tasting! You pay in front and you taste. There are the factory recommended selections and the shop attendants will help you what you try; A set of 5 different Apple ciders and/or some cognac like drinks. The prices are moderate, and we enjoyed with a pizza, as other foods we considered pricier. We will revisit next year and definitely during weekend as we did. We should check whether any weddings or likes to be there before heading. A nice place to stop by for a change after visiting a chain of wineries in VI.

Wonder why this restaurant keeps operating so many years!,"The worst Cantonese dishes we ever tasted!! The first one bite on wonton soup made me a bad feeling; why we chose to come in here? Well, we’re very hungry after playing golf so made a 180 degrees turn just before 4 km away from home. We decided to try this place as we’d never done. A very small smorg! Shame to use the Swedish traditional dish name-not comparable to the Swedish famous cousins. (They should have searched well what does “Smorg” really mean.) After we expressed “is the chef professionally trained and experienced?”. A lady “chef” came out and told, you should have ordered the stuff off the menu!.
