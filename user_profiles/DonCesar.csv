Need your own wheels,"Not an easy destination. You will need your own wheels and even with that, there is not space next to the road to park usually, or space at all for kilometers, so your best bet for a photo safari will be to take a bike. But where exactly? Information on internet is vague and mentions 7 towns.

Most of the good views are in one small road around 48°58'20.5""N 17°03'05.5""E . Still, no place to park just quick stops on the widening of the road to overtake and there is local traffic, so it’s not a deserted road. It’s a little let down, it’s not really prepared for tourism and probably leaving that coordinate above will make more people go, but so be it. Probably also will help eventually adding some more view points along the route.
