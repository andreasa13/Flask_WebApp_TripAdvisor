Good Food....Good Service,"Had Greek Salad and Gyro (Small pita bread bites with chicken/veggies on the side. Seemed more of the typical tourist type place.

Amazing Architecture,Nice to see how Greece is restoring this area. You will see and hear machinery as they are repairing damaged areas with the same original material. Amazing views.

Absolutey Wonderful Hotel,"An experience you will thoroughly enjoy from check-in to check-out.
Rooms - Very nice from linen, to bed comfort, amenities, etc. One of the best nights sleep I have ever had while traveling.
Absolutely perfect from beds and pillows, to toiletries. Pillow menu so you can request the pillow of your choice during your stay.
Breakfast - Buffet style. Very good. Great selection and fully stocked until 11am. Bacon, sausages, eggs (several cooked ways), breads, fruits, pastries, cereals, etc, etc, etc.
Roof Top Bar and Restaurant - good selection of dirnks and food. Reasonably priced. Fantastic view of Athens and the Acropolis, especially at night.
Roof Top Pool - small but well maintained and same great view at the restaurant.
Facilities and Staff are over-the-top. I can't say enough great things about how nice the facilities are and the staff is superb.

Great Staff and very nice grounds,"The resort staff are extremely nice and accommodating. Grounds are very nice and well maintained. Beach area is continously maintained throughout the day. The food is plentiful with a variety to select from. As with any all inclusive, food selection can become repetitive, but with a 7 nigth stay, there was always something different to select from. Rooms are spacious. Stayed in 1909 which is very close to the main building which means the entertainment can be somewhat loud, but they shut it down by 11pm so it's not too bad if you're an early to bed type person.

Great Vacation,"Overall great vacation. Grounds and facilities well maintained and overall good repair. Staff is super friendly. For those ""foodies"" who always complain about the food, if you can't find something you like at the Riu, then maybe you should stay home. Food was good, but sometimes a bit over seasoned with salt. Did not try the Italian, but all others and food was fine. Ribeye steaks were outstanding at the Steakhouse. Rooms were comfortable, nothing elaborate. Staying in 3135. AC wasn't the best, but the maintenance staff were quick to try and resolve. Did not ask for a different room, but quite sure the staff would have assisted in our relocation.

"Great Diving, Great Staff","World Class operation from pick up to return. Nereida and Michael were great. Excellent communication, excellent customer service. The facilities/boats are outstanding. The diver masters and dive masters in training are extremely knowledgeable and make every effort possible to make every dive the best. Having experienced dive operations in numerous other countries, I can say this is was the best experience by far. From the first dive to the last, they cater to your needs. Configure you gear before the first dive and all dives afterwards. All you have to do is show up, get on the boat, and enjoy diving. They clean and store your gear daily. I must give a shout out to Bella, Alex, Ben, and Tibrious.

Lobby bar was great for hanging out and relaxing. The disco was very nice with a good play list. The pool was great for a refreshing swim. Small, but adequate. The beach is awesome. I would highly recommend spending a few days on the beach. Beach bar/Lobby Bar/Pool Bar are well stocked. If you can't find what you're looking for, then you probably don't need it.

Nice Resort. Wonderful hot springs.,"Stopped at this resort for 4 hours during one of our excursions to Arenal Volocano. Beautiful resort, numerous hot springs, wonderful grounds, and a magnificent view of the Arenal Volcano. Dinner was good, nothing over the top. I would have enjoyed spending more time at this resort.

Good Vacation....But could be better,"1. Internet: If you are not Platinum then you must purchase Wi-Fi. Which wouldn't be bad @ $69 per week or $20 per day; however, it is very spotty. Still functional for me to post on trip advisor though. No access at the pools. Access in your room and some select locations. You can pay to go to the Chill Out bar and have Wi-Fi, but then you can only get into the ocean which will be discussed later.
2. Restaurants: If you book Jr Suite Deluxe then you have access to several restaurants other than those deemed for Platinum. Some of the choices in the restaurants you would have access to under the Jr Deluxe Upgrade, still cost $$ for you have. So technically not ""All Inclusive"". The two main buffets (Sunset/Rivera) are good. Numerous food selections and several of the main courses you get in the buffets are the same as in the restaurants. So, unless you enjoy dressing up, I recommend the buffets and beach grill. Only one cook for breakfast. Long lines to get eggs or omelet which also blocks access to a lot of the other hot foods
3. Grounds: Absolutely beautiful. I can’t say enough about how nice they are.
4. Rooms: Jr Deluxe Suite/Swim Out. Comfortable and accommodating. If you enjoy a very firm bed, then you will be happy with these. Mini fridge filled daily. Plenty of bottled water available in room and fridge. Housekeeping was ok, but nothing to rave about. If you leave a tip in the room for the staff, they will provide more towels and wash clothes. They will also place animal towel figures on you bed if you’re into that.
5. Staff: Restaurants have great staff. Very friendly and accommodating. Bars: Very slow and lines to get a drink most of the time. They’re still very nice, but if your impatient, then don’t go to the middle pool bar or beach bar. The other bars seemed to not be as crowded.
6. Tipping: I always recommend a few extra $$ for those staff who are exceptional. Unfortunately, some of the staff tend to not work as hard if you aren’t tipping them. Just my observation.
7. Gym: Two old cable machines, several dumbbells, zero free weights. Spin bikes are not well maintained and don’t bring you spin shoes…no clips. Some of the other cardio didn’t function properly. You can get a workout, but crowded until around noon. Yoga class is a basic class but still good.
8. Spa: Excellent. Staff, facilities, prices…All excellent
9. Beach: Plenty of chairs and relatively clean. BRING WATER SHOES. You will cut your feet otherwise on rocks.

Dive Trip 2014,"Resort was good except had our pool bag stolen on day 2 of the trip which contained several hundred dollars of devices (FitBit, MP3 Player, etc) along with our safe key. FYI, $150 for the lost key and they hotel wanting to charge us to replace the safe door they destroyed. Front desk is below average and need lessons in customer service. All of the other staff from restaurants, pool, beach, etc., were very nice and accommodating.

The beach grill and bar is across the street and can either be accessed via the underground tunnel or for the adventurous type, you can play ""Frogger"" across the traffic. Beach is small but plenty of room to relax on. Dive Paradise (we used Deep Life Divers http://www.mydeeplife.com instead) is also located on next to the beach/grill/bar.

Snorkeling is nice just off the beach with multiple places to enter and exit.

Some of the beds have an egg crate cover while others are just hard. If you like a firm mattress, then you will enjoy these.

Rooms where average but adequate.

Pool area is very nice and large.

Very Strong Currents,"As with any dive, a lot of it depends on the time of year. Current was very strong and vis wasn't good at all. Dropped to 62' and I was swept away by the current (along the reef) and separated from my group. I found myself drifting alone for approximately 2 mins, but along the reef. With my diving experience, I could of done one of two things, abort the dive or look from another dive group. Took a deep breath, checked my gauges, looked around and saw bubbles on the other side of the reef. I kicked over the reef, found the dive master and completed my dive with his group. After we completed the dive, his boat captain radioed to my boat and I was reunited with my group. Then proceeded to dive two. Always keep calm, find another dive group, and in unable to do so in a very short time (2 min or less), proceed with a normal accent.

GREAT....,"Length of stay - Oct 3 - 12, 2013. There were 8 in our group (6 divers/2 non-divers). The Tides is a very nice family place to stay. Rooms where clean, fresh paint, and overall nice décor. Each room has satellite TV and a small refrigerator. AC worked well. WiFi worked very well. Pool was very nice as is the surrounding deck. Plenty of chairs and loungers. Eden, Meagan, and Arian (3 of the 5 daughters) are great. Meagan and Arian brought us breakfast every morning poolside and was catered to our limited needs. They maintained the rooms and are a pleasure to be around... Eden is wonderful...She coordinated our excursions made sure we had everything we needed. I can't say enough things about all three. They truly made the trip exceptional. There is very limited beach, but you can sit as the pool and are approximately 25' from the ocean. We swam and snorkeled at the end of the pier which is where the dive shop is located. But really spent most of you time poolside after our dives.

Restaurants and shopping are within a 2 - 10 min walk. Plenty of places to get any type of groceries you desire.

Diving....Great. Patojo is an outstanding dive master. Dolphins, nurse sharks, reef sharks, turtles, eels, rays, lobster, crab, etc. Every dive was a new experience. He would find things the average dive master probably wouldn't. I can't say enough about Patojo. At the end of each dive, he assisted with removing all of our gear prior to climbing into the boat. Alex...WOW. He made the diving extremely easy. He setup, loaded, and cleaned our gear everyday. When he wasn't working with us diving, he was at poolside assisting.

There are way too many good things to say about The Tides, the family, and the diving. If you have any questions or need additional information, feel free to send me message.",October 2013,Ocean Tide Beach Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g291962-d310363-Reviews-Ocean_Tide_Beach_Resort-San_Pedro_Ambergris_Caye_Belize_Cayes.html,"Ambergris Caye, Belize",hotels,5.0,4.5
Nice little bar on the beach,"Met he owner and very friendly. 5p-7p 2 for 1 rum drinks. Wasn't serving food because it was during slow season.

Very good trip,"Belize Zoo and Zipline. I would definitely recommend the zoo. The Belize Zoo is wonderful. The owner doesn't get government assistance, but does well with contributors and money collected from admissions. Zipline consisted of 5 lines, took about 45 minutes for all lines with a group of 5. Lines are somewhat short and slow. But good escape. Waited on another group to finish cave tubing...snacks, beer, and rum punch was provided during our wait for them which made it nice. Breakfast and lunch is provided with this tour. Boat ride to the main land good. Guides where very knowledgeable and entertaining. Overall, I would recommend",October 2013,Searious Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g291962-d672049-Reviews-Searious_Adventures-San_Pedro_Ambergris_Caye_Belize_Cayes.html,"Ambergris Caye, Belize",attractions,4.0,5.0
Great vacation experience,"We had 11 adults in our group and 6 are divers. The resort is very clean and all of the staff members we encountered were very polite and helpful. Resturants open on different days, so we only sampled a couple, however, the World Cafe (Buffet) was always good and one could always find something to eat. They had a good selection and their theme night dining was good as well. Rooms were comfortable. Check-in and out was very smooth. The reception staff were very accommodating for our group. The beach, pools, and bars were wonderful. For the divers, we dove our first two dives with Gri Gri (located on the resort) and our remaining 6-8 dives with Sharky's which is a 10 min walk on the beach to their shop. It appeared for those with children, they have alot of activities including, but not limited to a game room, basketball, pool tables, batting cage, etc. Although we were a group of adults, the resort is large enough that children were no problem at all. As far as the Preferred is concerned, I wouldn't recommend. Most of the time, the preferred side was on the other side because there isn't a beach on the preferred, only a pool. All in All, I would highly recommend this resort. We will return.",September 2012,"Hilton La Romana, an All-Inclusive Adult Only Resort",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g663484-d1163459-Reviews-Hilton_La_Romana_an_All_Inclusive_Adult_Only_Resort-Bayahibe_La_Altagracia_Province_Do.html,Dominican Republic,hotels,5.0,4.5
GREAT...WONDERFUL....EXCEPTIONAL,"Stephan, David, and Bruno were great. I had (6) reef and (1) wreck dive with David and he is absolutely phenomenal. He found sea life that others would just pass by. Provided a tremendous amount of information and extremely knowledgeable. I can't say enough about him. GREAT...EXTRAORDINARY..WONDERFUL.

I had (2) Cenotes dives with Stephan and although I wasn't the most comfortable about being in a cave, Stephan was able to provide a level of comfort that allowed me to enjoy the dives. He is ""top-notch"" and first class in my book.

I highly recommend The Reef Marina for any type of diving you choose. I assure you that you will not be disappointed.

The Good and The Bad,"The Good and Bad

Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by courteous staff member who assisted us with our luggage and directed us to registration. Our room wasn’t available for an additional 1 hour, however, the front desk staff member instructed us to go get some lunch, have a drink or two, and return in one hour. All of this was fine until “The Bad” happened. Before we left the registration area, we were approached by person wearing a resort name tag and asked us to come to the Concierge Desk for some additional information. I was thinking they were going to provide us with a map of the resort and an activities list. We are immediately asked to take a 90 minute tour of the resort which would provide information to make our stay more pleasant but we had to bring a card card, identification, and put down a $20 refundable deposit. When asked if this was a time share sales presentation, we were told no and I quote: “We are not selling time shares.” We did not participate but did over hear one of the salesman tell another couple it was $4000 per year for 25 years. We did speak with one couple who informed us the 90 minute presentation was 3 hours of their time wasted. Seems reasonable….RIGHT….. So with that being said, steer clear of the “No Time Share Salesperson(s)” unless you are looking to invest in one.

Second part of the story. We were having some communication issues with our transportation agencies (Olympus - Roberto) and when we went to the concierge desk to ask for assistance, the supervisor stated “Why should I help you, you didn’t participate in our time share presentation.” He also stated that he and the others there are not part of the hotel, but part of the time share only….WOW…Wearing a Reef Resort name badge, in the Reef Resort lobby, at a Concierge Desk and doesn’t want to assist a customer. Can you say GET ANOTHER JOB…. I immediately went to the Front Desk and was promptly assisted by a staff member (Fernando). Now that’s great customer service.

Now to the GOOD. The resort is very nice, clean, and accommodating. All staff members were very helpful and attentive. The food was very good and there was a wide variety in the buffet area. We ate at the snack grill and both restaurants as well and they also very good. Both pool areas are very nice and the beach area is wonderful. All four bar areas for very nice and have a wide selection of drinks.

I would like to especially thank Alex (beach bar area) for his hard work. He had only been employed at the Reef for four days, but wow, he went way above and beyond. He was always pleasant, had a smile on his face, and proficient at his work. The Reef would do even better if more staff members would follow Alex’s lead.

For the diver…..I can not say enough about David, Stephan, and Bruno. They are extremely knowledgeable and very accommodating. My dive buddy and I had seven dives with David and two Cenote dives with Stephan. They dive shop has everything you need with top of line AquaLung equipment. For those Nitrox certified divers, it is included a no additional charge. If you are thinking about getting certified, they provide an intro to scuba at the pool at no charge.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Reef Resort and the Reef Resort Marina (Dive Shop). Just remember to say no to the Time Share sales people in the lobby. They are very rude if you don’t want to waste 3 hours of your vacation for an $80 spa treatment.",October 2011,The Reef Playacar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150812-d214263-Reviews-The_Reef_Playacar-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",hotels,4.0,4.0
