Rooftop view was the only nice thing.,"The rooftop view here is exceptional but that's the only thing that was exceptional. The rooms were outdated and not what you would expect from somewhere saying they were 5 star. the breakfast is dismal and only some of the staff are friendly. Its almost like you have to pick and choose who you talk to which is quite sad. Needless to say what was the tip of the iceberg was we asked for a recommendation on our last night, hoping that we would get a recommendation of at least somewhere amazing to eat to remember our trip. They recommended a restaurant called Liondi. Being traditional we were expecting something amazing but the food wasn't even one of the best places we ate. Not only that, there were so many smokers at the tables all you could really taste was smoke (yes i know where in Europe, but most Europeans have the decency to smoke on the tables around the outside of the restaurant) and I'm almost certain the chef came out for a smoke as well near the tables. The prices were also very high for what they offered especially with that environment. So overall this was a terrible stay in a run down hotel and then a terrible last night, off the recommendation of staff who i expected would know great places to eat. Would have given a second star is they at least gave a great recommendation of a restaurant to eat at.",September 2019,Royal Olympic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d206779-Reviews-Royal_Olympic-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,1.0,4.0
