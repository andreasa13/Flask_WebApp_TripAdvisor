Wonderful gelato!,"This is located in Piazza di Sant' Eustachio. It is directly across from the acclaimed Cafe. It was the middle of the afternoon, so we didn't want espresso. I had read great reviews and Punto Gelato did not disappoint! From chocolate with blue cheese and pine cone gelato, you will find unusual flavors! We went with more conventional ones: chocolate, salted caramel, and lemon. So good! Located around the corner from Piazza Navona, about a block from the Pantheon.",November 2018,Gunther Gelato italiano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d10597918-Reviews-Gunther_Gelato_italiano-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Four beautiful fountains!,"We were on a quest to see some of Rome's unique fountains. Leaving the Spanish Steps on Via Sistina, about 5 minutes brings you to Piazza Barberini. Continue another block or two, and you will find yourself at an intersection with four amazing Bernini fountains, one at each corner!",November 2018,Quattro Fontane,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d245584-Reviews-Quattro_Fontane-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.0
Must see the inside of this church!,"The beautiful ceiling is breathtaking! This church is behind the Pantheon, and there is an obelisk in front of the church with a beautiful elephant sculpture by Bernini. Take a few minutes to walk behind the Pantheon - it's one of my favorites in Rome!",November 2018,Santa Maria Sopra Minerva,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d243025-Reviews-Santa_Maria_Sopra_Minerva-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here two nights while on a land tour. The hotel is lovely, and decor very Roman. Our room was beautiful and clean. The walls are not well insulated, as we could here talking in the room above us. However, our breakfasts were delicious, and the location was perfect for us. We went on our own the day we arrived and were able to walk to the Spanish Steps in about 10 minutes. We were able to see other nearby sites, Piazza del Popolo and Piazza Barberini. The hotel clerk was helpful in recommending a wonderful restaurant for dinner one evening, one of our best dinners in Italy. Very nice!!",November 2018,Hotel Romanico Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d656857-Reviews-Hotel_Romanico_Palace-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0
Loved this fountain!,"The Fountain of the Turtles is located in Piazza Mattei. It was about a 10-15 minute walk from Piazza Venezia. We were on a quest to see some of the unique fountains of Rome, and were glad we walked here! There's a charming restaurant in the Piazza, where we had amazing homemade ravioli filled with cheese and spinach, and delicious asparagus crepes! Small and picturesque Piazza for a wonderful fountain!",November 2018,Fontana delle Tartarughe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d191117-Reviews-Fontana_delle_Tartarughe-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
Beautiful church with Michelangelo sculpture,"Worth the short walk from the Colosseum! Located in Piazza di San Pietro in Vincoli (St Peter in Chains). You turn into what seems like an alley to reach this Piazza. The inside of the church is lovely, and the sculpture of Moses is amazing! You can also see the chains that once held St Peter.",November 2018,San Pietro in Vincoli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192275-Reviews-San_Pietro_in_Vincoli-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
