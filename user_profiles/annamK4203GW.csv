A fabulous experience,"We were treated to a truly special evening of food and wine at The Lyle. Great atmosphere and what a change from how it was. All the staff were professional, attentive and engaging and it was truly the best food we've had in a long time. We'll be returning as soon as we can.",October 2020,The Lyle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186315-d21311790-Reviews-The_Lyle-Royal_Tunbridge_Wells_Kent_England.html,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Great lunch with friends in a COVID safe environment,"Having booked well in advance we had the nervous among us taking their first trip out since March. The staff clearly explained their one way system, all diners are outside under the new gazebo and all the staff wore face masks or visors. Our lunch was a pleasure from beginning to end. All the waiting staff were friendly, professional and attentive, with a good dose of humour thrown in, every one went to extra lengths to make our lunch a great experience.
The food and wine were all great and the menu is less restricted that some more recently opened restaurants. I have no hesitation in recommending.",July 2020,The Mount Edgcumbe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186315-d752735-Reviews-The_Mount_Edgcumbe-Royal_Tunbridge_Wells_Kent_England.html,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Jail breaking fun,"What a fantastic time, lots of clue cracking to do, there were 6 of us, everyone enjoyed it and played their part.

Iconic place,"It was a great place to see, went early as found out you can run there, sadly not on the track but around the top.

Clever sympathetic restoration.,"The restoration of the Parthenon is almost complete, it's breathtaking in its size and dominance. The restoration is great, they have chosen to only restore to the height of any original pieces left, a clever idea and makes you understand and appreciate its history more.",October 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A guided tour is essential,Obviously the top place to visit in Athens but to appreciate it a guided tour is essential as are sensible shoes and a bottle of water.

"Great location, helpful staff, rooftop bar and restaurant","This hotel is well located as an easy walk to many attractions. The breakfast was great and the staff really friendly and efficient, they were always happy to seat our group together. Reception staff were helpful too. Room was neat and shower room was small but all working well. Lighting in the room could have been better but that's a minor point.
The view of the Acropolis from the roof was fabulous.",October 2019,Electra Hotel Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228883-Reviews-Electra_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
"Wine tour, tasting and lunch",We had booked a wine tour and tasting and were fortunate that the timing allowed us to stay and have lunch in this fantastic restaurant. The wine tour was informative and the tasting of 4 wines was well tutored and informed - the 2014 Nerello Mascalese from Etna was my star of the show. Our host was exceptional and it was particularly helpful to me as I'm a WSET student. The food was superb and all set in a stunning location overlooking some to Gulfi's vineyards where the harvest was in full swing.,September 2019,Locanda Gulfi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1079945-d2212791-Reviews-Locanda_Gulfi-Chiaramonte_Gulfi_Province_of_Ragusa_Sicily.html,"Sicily, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Make your own gin.... yes please!,A fun experience making our own gin - which tastes great. the gin cocktails we had during the time were delicious. An interesting way to spend a few hours and great that you get to understand the whole process.

4 week wine comparison,4 Tuesday evenings well spent comparing Old and New world wines with a great group of people and the extremely knowledgeable Victoria.

A lovely surprise find,"After a visit to Petworh enroute to the New Forest we were looking for place to stop for lunch. We're very glad we stopped here, service great and the food was amazing. The toilets were spotless too - a particular point in their favour as this is so often what let's a restaurant down.

Climbing the 02 for the view,"This was good fun and staff were efficient and friendly, our guide Liam was helpful to everyone in our group. It was a rainy, windy cold day which was a shame as the views would have been better in the sun.

Consistently poor service,"The Royal Wells is in a great location which should make it the perfect place for meeting with friends and family coming to visit our home town. unfortunately the service is consistently poor, staff are never trained and as other reviewers have said they often don't seem to want to be there. On my most recent visit staff seemed to vanish leaving just the newest member of staff (he'd started that day) to try and cope with an increasingly busy bar, I went to find some help for him to discover even the reception desk unstaffed with a notice directing people to seek help from the bar staff!",April 2018,Royal Wells Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186315-d193877-Reviews-Royal_Wells_Hotel-Royal_Tunbridge_Wells_Kent_England.html,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",hotels,2.0,4.0

Well located hotel,"We booked a 3 night long weekend, the hotel is in a great central location although like others we found this quite noisy from the student bars nearby which saw people spilling onto the street at all hours.
Having only one small lift and no option to use stairs was irritating particularly as we were a group of 8 and we had to wait for everyone each time we were either coming back or going out.
The room seemed recently decorated although we couldnt use the drawers. The bathroom had some plumbing issues with a leaking sink, a loose toilet seat (which got taken away, refitted and then replaced) and a lack of water pressure for the shower.
Staff were friendly although oddly wanted to discourage us from a restaurant reservation we'd made even offering to cancel it for us.... We went and it was great.
Overall the location was the best point for this hotel being in the centre of the old district with plenty nearby to walk to.",October 2017,Decumani Hotel de Charme,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187785-d1068538-Reviews-Decumani_Hotel_de_Charme-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.5
Fantastic hotel in great location,This is a wonderful family run hotel the staff are all friendly and efficient the food is top class and it's really well located just a short walk from the lifts.

Fascinating!,Well worth the effort to visit but I'm not sure that the title of ice palace gives an idea of what to expect. This glacier is unique and it's quite mind blowing to be walking around inside it and take a trip on a boat! Don't attempt it in ski boots and take your crash helmet as it's better than having to wear one they supply.,January 2016,Natur Eis Palast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1056049-d1889612-Reviews-Natur_Eis_Palast-Hintertux_Tirol_Austrian_Alps.html,"Hintertux, Austria",attractions,5.0,4.0
Great mountain restaurant,"You have to ski to the Spannagelhaus but it's worth the small effort to get there. Recently refurbished and with friendly efficient staff. The menu is good value and very tasty and service is very quick. The toilets are even on the same level as the restaurant so no struggling up and down stairs in ski boots. Visit the caves too, the entrance is right next to it.",January 2016,Spannagelhaus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1056049-d1319484-Reviews-Spannagelhaus-Hintertux_Tirol_Austrian_Alps.html,"Hintertux, Austria",restaurants,5.0,4.5
