Beautiful Little lake,"Battle ground Lake is a very peaceful place for a quiet walk in the fall or early spring. It tends to get a bit to busy and noisy for me in the summer when lots of kids are swimming and hanging out at the beach area. I'm glad that its enjoyed by so many, I just prefer the quieter times.",September 2019,Battle Ground Lake State Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g58345-d3473191-Reviews-Battle_Ground_Lake_State_Park-Battle_Ground_Washington.html,"Battle Ground, Washington",attractions,4.0,4.0
Awesome Hotel,"The Adrian Hotel was great, the room was very clean and well stocked with Drinks and snacks. The TV had a ton of channels and the view from the balcony was great.

Dinner,I have been here several times and the food is always fresh and delicious. The service is a bit slow but I have to say it's probably just because they stay so busy. The views of the river are relaxing and I enjoyed sitting on the patio near the woid fire. We will surely dine there again soon.,March 2019,McMenamins on the Columbia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60820-d440427-Reviews-McMenamins_on_the_Columbia-Vancouver_Washington.html,"Vancouver, Washington",restaurants,4.0,4.0
