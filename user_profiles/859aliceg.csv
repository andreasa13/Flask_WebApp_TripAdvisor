So much to see,I love Plaka! There are so many lovely unique shops with a huge variety of items and specialties. The strip with all the tavernas was lovely also.

Lovely staff and great food,"We chose this restaurant as they had something for everyone. The food for lovely and very well priced! They brought out a high chair for our 11 month old and played/carried him around when he got slightly restless allowing us to enjoy our meal. The staff were fantastic!!
Thank you very much for a lovely meal and experience",September 2018,Styl Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4831017-Reviews-Styl_Cafe-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Loved every bit of it,"This is something that can’t be missed while visiting Athens. We love every bit of it. The history and magnificent of the Parthenon is unbelievable. We are travelling with an 11 month old and would recommend using a baby carrier as a pram would be too much hassle while getting to the top as well as the rocks etc while looking around. The only downside of the experience was the amount of people, don’t expect to take any photos without a bunch of other tourists in the shot.",September 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

He drove us to all the sights we wanted to see and would quickly pulled over when we saw shops we wanted to look at. We have a great day!

His English is very good and he's very knowledgable!!!

Loved it!,"This is the first time I have been to Frankensteins and I loved it! The live band were amazing, the friends are so friendly and the dancers were hilarious.
The drinks were severed in weird and wonderful ways!
I will be back",May 2016,Frankensteins Laboratory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g469404-d1867477-Reviews-Frankensteins_Laboratory-Seminyak_Kuta_District_Bali.html,"Seminyak, Indonesia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
