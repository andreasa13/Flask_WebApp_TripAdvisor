Good beach,"Good beach!

Big, nice sea, not too windy. The best beach bar by far is Trata (I think that’s how you spell it) with big wooden beach beds and waiter service.

Would definitely recommend",August 2020,Agios Prokopios Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g805487-d1176100-Reviews-Agios_Prokopios_Beach-Agios_Prokopios_Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Naxos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good but not great!,"So there are several points to mention from our four day stay at the Argo.

Firstly the rooms are lovely, we had two ground floor rooms for our family and they were side by side. Perfect, clean, cool and comfy.

The reception staff are also very helpful and friendly.

The bar is handy but a bit strange, we came back after dinner one night and took us ages to get a drink, everyone had disappeared, however it was late. Can’t tell what time the bar closes. The café freddos are great.

The WiFi is AWFUL, hardly any connection even on the ground floor near reception. Super slow and pretty much useless. This would 100% need to be rectified for this hotel to keep up with modern 2020 demands.

The pool and spa were nice and we used both.

The BEST part of the hotel for us was the location. The beach is literally round the corner.

Would I stay again if in Naxos? yes probably.

Would I recommend the hotel? Yes.

Overall an enjoyable stay.",August 2020,Argo Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580192-d506473-Reviews-Argo_Boutique_Hotel-Naxos_Town_Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Naxos, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
HOT HOT HOT,"August in Athens. We are three able bodied people in our 20s and positively melted during our trip to the acropolis.

HOWEVER - we loved it and really enjoyed the experience.

I would make sure you bring suitable shoes and water - the shop there only sold fizzy drinks and sugary juices!?!

The tour guides at the top are actually very off putting - they try and outbid each other and get slightly angry at one another. In hindsight I’d pre-book a tour and include the museum.

We did persevere and found Simon a lovely tour guide who did a fab job and took us round for €60+ entry. We were in there over an hour, he was informative and engaging (hard in the heat).

Would recommend to anyone visiting Athens",August 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Family stay,"My family and I stayed for two nights in August. We spent a long time looking at hotels in Nafplio and this ticked a lot of our boxes.

Overall I’m glad we stayed here. The room was large, bathroom lovely and great views over the town.

Downsides were that my mother is frail on her feet and the walk to town was stressful and a bit of a nightmare for her.

I would stay here again with friends or family but take the steep walk into consideration.

Overall very happy.

Disappointing recommendation.,"We came here as it was recommended by our lonely planet guidebook. We arrived at 9 and queued 20 mins for a table, so far a promising start. Plenty of waiters and an organised waiting line for tables. We sat down (table of 4) and waited about 10 mins for anyone to come over to us at all. Even for water which in Greece has been coming out to the table as soon as we sat down. We ordered the Naxos potato fries as per the book, mussels, shrimp pasta, calamari and a salad to share. The food was big, plenty of it. However the Naxos potato Fries were just chips, nothing special can’t see why they were recommended. The salad however was great and would recommend. The mussels were very disappointing, no sauce, dry and a bit gritty. Would not recommend. The table also enjoyed the shrimp pasta and the calamari. Would we go back? No. Would we recommend? Probably not. There are nicer places to eat on the island. The dessert on the house was lovely though - Greek yogurt with carrots. Disappointing meal though overall.",August 2020,Meze Meze,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580192-d1791017-Reviews-Meze_Meze-Naxos_Town_Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Naxos, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Great find,We stayed here for two nights in August. The whole process was super easy and we found our apartment and keys with ease. The apartment was great. Enough room for three and nice kitchen. The bathroom had no ventilation - at least we couldn’t turn it on so it often got very warm and sticky after people’s showers. We only had skylights as a way of ventilating the apartment. I imagine that ordinarily would be fine however it was a warm August weekend. I would definitely use union bank apartments again and thought that they were a good option when staying in Liverpool.,August 2019,Union Bank Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186337-d11905155-Reviews-Union_Bank_Apartments-Liverpool_Merseyside_England.html,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5

Okay but not worth the money,"We came to penguin island on the ferry we paid $54 dollars for the pleasure of the trip and the discovery centre. As we were on the ferry we could see people walking in the water past us and to the island. It’s very shallow, you can walk. Kids were able to walk too. The ferry journey really is just to keep your stuff dry, next time we’d prepare and happily walk the water.

The discovery centre was a definitely highlight. You can pay for that separately when you come to the island. It’s great for animal lovers, kids and great to hear about their penguin rehab facility - 5 stars for that.

The trip isn’t worth the $54 we paid for two. Next time I would walk the narrow crossing in the water and still do the discovery centre.

The island also smells of rotting seaweed, this can’t be helped but be prepared.

Good but not 5star,"We stayed here September 2017, my boyfriend and I and my mum and her partner. We had upgraded to the superior pool facing room, my mother was staying in the other block (no upgrades) we both had a balcony and a similar amount of space.

The room - I can only comment on the superior room as I didn't see my mother's quarters. Our room had plenty of space, a great balcony which we could watch the evenings entertainment from and a nice shower. The fridge in the room was empty so we bought big bottles of water to keep us going through the week. We also had a coffee machine with pods that were replenished daily. The aircon was also VERY good. The negative - there was often a stink of sewage in the morning after the first flush. We would flush the loo and then have to leave as the smell was so bad. This was sorted by the time we went back in to get dressed for dinner. The fire alarm also went off twice, I raised this with reception and the issue was sorted.

The food - we were on half board and didn't get the drinks package as we aren't big drinkers. I'm a fussy eater and could always find something to eat on the buffet. The salad bar was good. Everyone else in our party didn't struggle and were pleasantly surprised after having read bad reviews.

Location - the location of the hotel is perfect, the boats to the other towns is opposite and the beach is over the road. This was a huge plus for us.

Reception also often smelt of drains, but we didn't hang around in there often.

We can't comment on the entertainment as we never really watched it. From our balcony I can say that the Latino singer was excellent and got the crowd going. Having a pool facing room also means you can hear the rush at 9am when the doors open and floods of people rush to the sun beds, this didn't bother us though.

Would recommend this hotel, Es canar is also charming but we struggled to find a truly spanish experience anywhere we went. We heard more English spoken than anything else.",September 2017,Alua Soul Ibiza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g642208-d290938-Reviews-Alua_Soul_Ibiza-Santa_Eulalia_del_Rio_Ibiza_Balearic_Islands.html,"Ibiza, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.0

Excellent Free Tour of Stockholm,"Our guide Peter was knowledgeable, interesting and engaging. We came upon the tour online and weren't sure of how good it would be! How wrong we were!! Peter took us round all the sights of Stockholm with amazing insights and great humour. Never struggled to hear him and he interacted with each group at least once finding out names and where everyone was from. Our group was large but everyone was interacting and engaged with what peter was saying. Brilliant tour!!

Brilliant wvening,"Went to Isola on a Saturday evening, we booked and glad we did as they got very busy as the evening went on. We had a garlic bread with cheese to start with, the isola chilli sauce that comes with it is lovely. For main course we had the strips of beef calzone - 10/10 for flavour, the calzone was huge so perfect for lunch the next day. My boyfriend had a anchovi and tuna pizza - it had a lovely thin base, ideal for the toppings it had on it as they came through nicely and not overpowered by a thick dough. The bill was reasonable at £48 including drinks. The specials looked amazing. Will definitely go in and try some of them. Highly recommend Isola as a place to eat, couples, families, friends.",November 2016,Isola,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190928-d1103226-Reviews-Isola-Douglas_Isle_of_Man.html,"Isle of Man, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Brilliant,"We were recommended the Lipsmacking Foodie Tour by our holiday rep and boy we were not disappointed. Donald and Roland were great! Truly not a tour to be missed, the food was excellent, Donald's knowledge was great and the company was perfect. The restaurants that we went to on the evening tour were new to us and the food was mind blowing. The best bits of the tour were the snippets of information shared by Donald along the way.

Best food in Mykonos,"We came here because we overheard someone recommending it at our hotel to another guest. We were not disappointed, the location and ambience is second to none. The food portion sizes weren't as big as we had experience in the rest of the town so have a starter, especially if you're having the fish of the day with the shellfish. The angus black burger was superb and came with potatoes and salad. The Greek salad was described as excellent. Reserving a table is highly recommended and most people tend to dress up.",September 2014,Remezzo Restaurant and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d6640514-Reviews-Remezzo_Restaurant_and_Bar-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Fantastic stay in a lovely city.,"We (a family of three) just spent the most fantastic 6 days in the Conrad Hotel over New Years. Check in was seamless, the room was great and big too from what we had heart about hotel room sizes in Manhattan. The hotel bar was good, especially for a nightcap. We thought the location of the hotel was also ideal, out of the hustle and bustle of midtown but still with the convenience of the subway stop close by. The best thing about the hotel was the concierge Andy he was fantastic, he managed to get us into all the high end restaurants (benjamin steakhouse and the Tribeca grill) even though we were booking them the night we wanted to go, he also booked me on the helicopter trip round Manhattan ($180 with Liberty Helicopters and worth every penny), and advising us on how to get around on New Years Eve. Andy is the best concierge we have ever dealt with and he really made our fantastic holiday in NYC that much better. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to for a city trip to NYC.",December 2013,Conrad New York Downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d208452-Reviews-Conrad_New_York_Downtown-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Brilliant, friendly and enjoyable.","Considering the last time I rode was 2010 I was nervous about starting again, my friend recommended Pennybridge stables. I started slow with an idiots guide to riding where the instructor took the time to coach me on what I was doing whilst teaching/guiding the other kids what to do. I was soon trotting along in the lesson and feeling at ease with the horse who I had only known a matter of minutes. The lesson was excellent, enjoyable and entertaining, an hour went by and I'd had a great time (£28 for an hour). The second time I went I was put on a robot horse to improve my shoddy technique this was for half hour but believe me you wouldn't want any longer, although it was painful i felt like i'd had a proper work out and my technique improved as a result. I will be going again as soon as I can. Recommend this to any one of any age of any ability. Try it out.",July 2013,Pennybridge Riding School,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3780931-d3767563-Reviews-Pennybridge_Riding_School-Kirk_Michael_Isle_of_Man.html,"Isle of Man, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
Excellent,"We are regulars into L'experience as it is a short drive from our house and the set menu is a great option for when we don't want to cook. The set menu includes a starter, main course, dessert and coffee for £23.50 every Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. I would wholeheartedly recommend the French onion soup, it is the highlight of the meal, brilliantly prepared and delicious. Normally for main course steak is what we all go for, again cooked perfectly with nice accompaniments we also order extra creamed spinach and mushrooms instead of dessert and it costs us no extra. The house red is great and comes in a 1/2 litre carafe. Overall never had any complaints or problems and would recommend it highly as a place to come and eat when in the Isle of man.",September 2012,L'Experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190928-d1815374-Reviews-L_Experience-Douglas_Isle_of_Man.html,"Isle of Man, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fabulous Fish,"Tanroagan is absolutely the must visit restaurant on the Isle of Man if a fish lover. The restaurant is great well decorated, the dining area however a little small so best to book.

Perfect - just what the reviews say,"Tamam was a perfect way to end our holiday in Rhodes. We arrived and had the last table in the restaurant by luck, people were soon queuing by the door waiting for a table. The service was flawless considering the amount of people ordering at the same time, efficient and polite - if anything was taking its time this was met by sincere apologies from the waiter/owner. The food was brilliant the pitta bread starter with the feta dip was fantastic along with the grilled haloumi. One of our party had the fish with the peanuts and said it was magnificent, well worth a try. The house wine comes by the jug and is cheap and nice. Overall an excellent restaurant and well worth a visit - make sure you book as to avoid a wait.",July 2012,Tamam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635613-d1163671-Reviews-Tamam-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Just what we wanted.,"A friend and I booked to stay in Room mate Lola for a weekend in Malaga. Its proximity to the centre was perfect for us as we didn't have a car so it was just a 10 minute walk onto the Alameda. The hotel itself is very trendy with lots of different room to relax in our favourite being the chill out room, although there also was pink room and the breakfast room. The hotel came with free WiFi which was ideal in helping us search places to eat in Malaga. The area of Malaga it is in is the equivalent of of London's Soho area, there are a few bars and quite a lot of risqué night-life. The room was very clean and the staff were very helpful. However one downside to the room was it was very hot, although it was March and the weather we had at the time was unusual. The rooms have a tendency to carry noise which is slightly irritating at night but not enough to prevent any sort of sleep. The other Room Mate hotel in Malaga is in the epicentre of Malaga which would have been ideal, but unfortunately not in our price budget. Overall an excellent stay.",March 2012,Mariposa Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187438-d626299-Reviews-Mariposa_Hotel-Malaga_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html,"Malaga, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.0

PERFECT FOR WHAT WE WANTED,"2 of us stayed 3 nights in Los Patios Hotel and Restaurant. The location, size of the room and ambience couldn't be faulted in any way. Thehitel located right opposite the Mezquita was brilliant right in the heart of Cordoba. the room size was great we had two single beds and a satisfactory bathroom although the shower may have been small the power of the shower and water temperature made up for it.

The room however was FREEZING, we turned the heating up full and we were still suffering even with the extra blankets, my friend slept in a coat. The other parties room who we were travelling with however had a lovely room not as big but warm so maybe the heating just didn't work in ours. The views into the restaurant were nice with the plants and greenery and those with a view of the Mezquita have to be brilliant. Check in was good couldn't be faulted and check out the same. We came an late after a night out with some friends and had to ring the hotel doorbell this was however effective as we felt secure knowing who was coming in and out of the hotel at night.

Overall an excellent stay for very very little money.",February 2012,Hotel Los Patios,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187430-d647070-Reviews-Hotel_Los_Patios-Cordoba_Province_of_Cordoba_Andalucia.html,"Cordoba, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.0
JUST WHAT WE WANTED,3 of us stayed in Icaria Hotel Bracelona for 2 nights whilst on a city break in Barcelona. the hotel met all our needs and at an excellent price. We booked a triple room and it was excellent with sufficient space and comfortable beds even the 3rd as not a sofa but an actual bed. The hotel was however about a 15 minute walk from the nearest metro stop although this was fine it did take us a while to figure out where the hotel was when travelling from the airport. A taxi to and from the airport was around €30-€35 which was worth it on the way back and we had an early start. The only thing to be weary about is the PICKPOCKETS I had been in Barelona half an hour before someone tried to steal my purse luckily I noticed and the man ran off. Overall we had an excellent stay in the Icaria and would recommend it for those looking for quality with a low budget.,January 2012,Hotel SB Icaria Barcelona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d498018-Reviews-Hotel_SB_Icaria_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.0
GOOD but not 5*,"5 of us stayed at this hotel during the New year, we booked it on last minute.com due to a previous mess up with an apartment. We booked a suite because there were a room of 3, when we arrived the concierge was ready and took or bags for us.

We checked in very smoothly and quickly and went to our room. When we entered we realised it wasn't a suite in fact the room could not have possibly have fit 3 people for a week, just too crowded. So we went back downstairs to see correct the mistake, which was done promptly and the staff were very apologetic at the mix up so we got 3 glasses of wine on the house.

After the mix up we got shown our suite which was lovely although a shortage of towels and glasses which were duly brought up from reception. We ordered room service which was nice and came promptly. The room was very comfortable, spacious and clean.

The breakfast was a buffet and started at 6:30 till 10:00 on weekdays and till 11:00 on weekends. It was a good breakfast but i wouldn't say it was 5* and at times it was slightly cold/luke warm.

The subway stop outside the hotel was ideal and very cheap to use. The hotel is ideally located if you don't want the hustle and bustle of the centre but want a quickish journey into the main part of Prague

The SPA was open for 2 hours a day for everyone, the pool was nice and had fantastic views over the city, although small and slightly cold for my liking. The sauna and steam room were separated by sexes which is understandable. However i felt it lacked a Jacuzzi which would have completed the SPA. One of the members of our party had a pedicure for 1100 koruna and she said it was one of the best pedicures she's ever had, so this comes recommended,

Overall I enjoyed my stay although the hotel was not a 5 star all over it was more like a 4* 4.5*. I enjoyed my stay although if I returned to Prague I would probably look for another Hotel/Apartment the other side of Charles Bridge.",December 2011,Corinthia Hotel Prague,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d276530-Reviews-Corinthia_Hotel_Prague-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,4.0,4.0
