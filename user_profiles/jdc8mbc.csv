Excellent Take-out Japanese fusion lunch,"We had a gift certificate which we used to enjoy an excellent take-out lunch: Iyasare kakiage tempura, suzuki yaki and sashimi mori. Portions were plentiful, enough for two lunches for the two of us. We would definitely order the same thing the next time. We know that if we had eaten the tempura, it would have been over-the-top excellent but by the time we got the dish home, it had lost some of the crispiness. The sashimi mori had a wonderful collection, but our most favorite plate was the grilled suzuki yaki (grilled sea bass). A wonderful treat in the time of Covid!!! Highly recommended. A big shout-out to Dan for helping us with our order.",February 2021,Iyasare,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32066-d5601764-Reviews-Iyasare-Berkeley_California.html,"Berkeley, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
The Bad and the Good,"Overall we liked this place; however, there were a couple of incidents that were problematic. On our 2nd night, neither of our card keys wouldn't unlock the front door. It's a good thing we were returning to the condo before 11:00 pm when the front desk closes for the night. The cards had to be re-keyed. The second incident was on Day 3 . At check-in, we were told our condo would be cleaned on Day 3; however, no one showed up. A housekeeping attendant had come to deliver the extra blanket we requested and when we inquired about when our room would be cleaned, she had to check with the front office. Apparently the front desk forgot to notify housekeeping. We went out for an early dinner and when we got back, the trash was emptied, towels and amenities replaced. What we liked about the condo was the spaciousness, the kitchen set-up (coffee, dish detergent, sponge provided), and the washer/dryer. We were in Building 20 which is a long walk to the parking structure (and even longer walk to the front desk). We would recommend that housekeeping wash the kitchen floor which was dirty. At check-in, we were offered a discount card IF we attended a ""session"" which we knew to be a time-share presentation - we declined - and Holua was not pushy which we appreciated.",March 2020,Holua Resort at The Mauna Loa Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60872-d254754-Reviews-Holua_Resort_at_The_Mauna_Loa_Village-Kailua_Kona_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",hotels,4.0,4.5

"We ate here for breakfast, lunch and dinner","We ate here three times over a period of five days. Prices are a little high but food was delicious. The first time was for breakfast: one of us had the scumptious Ono Benedict and the other had the tasty homemade corned beef hash. Including two cups of coffee and tax, the bill was $40. We wished we could have returned for another breakfast because the menu was appealing.
The second time we came was for dinner. We shared a Caesar salad and red wine sangria. One of us ordered the Macadamian Mahi and the other the Hawaiian Ginger Ono. Both main dishes were satisfying. Bill totaled $89.
On our last full day in Kona, we lunch on Fish N Chips and the exceptional fish combo with battered fried mahi, calamari rings, and prawns.

Decent Mexican food,"We had driven to Waikoloa from Hilo in the morning and after having checked in, we were hungry, but we also wanted to explore the grounds. We ended up at the Boat Landing Cantina, an open air cafe by the Ocean Tower terminus of the tram.

Dined here twice,"Both nights' dinners pleased us, but we were especially delighted by the first night's meal. We ordered the special fish dish with purple sweet potato, ginger monchong with sushi rice cake, tower of Maui onion rings, and a Moana Mule. Tab came to $144 including tax. The second night we shared a Caesar salad and the Seafood Tower for 2 (lobster, tiger prawns, Pacific oysters, and king crab leg). Bill including tax was $118. Be sure to make reservations with the concierge. The earliest seating we could get both nights was 6:30 pm. The first night we sat outside and got to experience a beautiful sunset.

"Shout-out to Kelli, front desk reception","We are multi-year Diamond HH members and having stayed at many of Hilton's hotels around the world, we expect a certain level of quality and service. We were on the Big Island at the start of the month, before the onset of Covid-19 in Hawaii. On this particular trip to the Big Island, we experienced the worst and best of the Hilton brand. Our stay in Hilo was disappointing and below Hilton standards. The night before we arrived at Waikoloa we tried to do a digital check-in but none of the offered rooms matched the Makai Ocean Front with lanai king bed room we had booked months ago. We called the Hilton Waikoloa and asked why we were offered a resort view (parking lot view) room instead of the ocean front room with lanai that we had reserved. The reservations desk clerk on the other end of the line advised us to talk to the manager upon our arrival at the Hilton Waikoloa. When we got to the registration desk, we were feeling rather tense and stressed and braced for another disappointment -- but Kelli calmly listened to our story, checked the registration, and gave us keys to Room 6304 which was a king bed room with ocean front view and lanai... exactly what we had reserved. It was Kelli, with her beautiful and warm smile, her serene and calming voice, her very helpful suggestions which enhanced our stay; and her genuine aloha spirit, that set the pace and tone for a most wonderful respite at Hilton's Waikola Village. Our biggest regret was that we had only booked a two-night stay; we wished we had added another night or two before moving on to Kailua-Kona. (We began in Hilo, stayed in Waikoloa, and then finished our trip in Kailua-Kona.)
Our room was equipped with iron and ironing board; robes; slippers; comp water bottles; spacious closet; full dresser; mini-fridge, Keurig coffee/tea maker, DVD player, and Kohala Spa coco-mango bath products.
We understand why guests don't want/need to leave the premises: the resort is self-contained. We loved the salt water lagoon which is ideal for snorkeling with plenty of large green turtles, tropical fish, and even a conger eel; access to the lagoon is via a sandy beach. Next to the lagoon is where guests can play, for a price, with dolphins. There are several pools and tennis court which we did not use. One can get lots of steps simply by walking and meandering throughout the resort. In the breezeways which connect all three towers are displays of museum-quality works of art, paintings, and objets d'art. There is a tram and boat which can transport guests from one tower to another but we chose to walk. As part of the resort fees, one can get ukulele, hula, and lei-making lessons; we opted to attend the ukulele lesson which was fun. The resort fees also include a complimentary photo. (Book 24 hrs in advance and allow about 30-45 minutes for the photo shoot.) If staying at the Makai Lagoon tower, the self-parking lot is close by; if staying at the Palace or Ocean Towers, then one might opt for valet parking. Breakfast is offered at the Big Island Breakfast hall. One can order a la carte or opt for either the continental or hot buffet. The continental breakfast ($28) is extensive and impressive with plenty of breads and pastries, exotic fruits, cereals, yogurts, parfaits, hot oatmeal, Chinese congee, and Japanese miso soup with all the fixings (e.g., tofu, daikon, pickles, kimchee, parsley, green onions). We did not opt for the ""hot"" buffet ($40) because there was way more than we could ever eat in one sitting: waffle station, omelet bar, pancakes, French toast, hot trays filled with meats, and other delights. We plan to return! Mahalo, Kelli, for your outstanding service and warm and hospitable welcome!",March 2020,Hilton Waikoloa Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60608-d89980-Reviews-Hilton_Waikoloa_Village-Waikoloa_Kohala_Coast_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",hotels,5.0,4.0
Smelly room; horrible breakfast; unhappy staff,"We stayed at the Grand Naniloa and then at Hilton's Waikoloa. It was like night and day, worst to best. We hated our experience at the Grand Naniloa. At the Grand Naniloa, Ashlynn, the unfriendly and unhelpful desk clerk, did not acknowledge us as Diamond members, did not offer us water, did not give us our comp breakfast coupons. We ended up speaking to Sierra, another desk clerk, who graciously provided us with the comp water and breakfast coupons. Overall, it seemed the staff were not a friendly, happy group; dour seems an appropriate description; lacked the aloha spirit. We were assigned Room 328. The bathroom smelled like a combination of urine and mold. We used our carry-on Lysol spray in an attempt to mask the smell but were unsuccessful. We only travel with carry-on luggage (we never check luggage) so we were surprised by the severely limited storage space: no place to store luggage; a tiny closet (even small by European standards) and 2 small under-the-desk drawers; no dresser; no iron/ironing board. Breakfast at the hotel's Hula Hula restaurant was beyond dreadful and definitely not up to Hilton standards. The ""cold"" breakfast cost $16 for breads, cold cereals (no granola), yogurt, oranges, apples, a limit of 2 slices of papaya; a choice of passo-guava and orange juice; no apple or tomato juice; no peanut butter, no bananas . For $22, one can get the ""hot"" breakfast which is the never-changing oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, Portuguese sausage slices, steamed rice, and breakfast potatoes. One can order off the menu instead of the buffet but we recommend leaving the hotel and finding a nearby breakfast restaurant. Parking is included in the $30 resort fee: one can choose between valet parking or self-parking in the lots across the street from the hotel. We've been Diamond members for years -- this is the most disappointing Hilton-chain hotel we've been to.",March 2020,Grand Naniloa Hotel Hilo - a DoubleTree by Hilton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60583-d113096-Reviews-Grand_Naniloa_Hotel_Hilo_a_DoubleTree_by_Hilton-Hilo_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",hotels,1.0,3.5
Counter-clockwise is easier on this 4-mile hike,"Start early in the day, if only because parking is extremely limited at the Kilauea Iki Overlook. There are two ways to hike: clockwise, the more difficult direction which begins with an unpaved path, or counterclockwise, the easier direction which begins with going down steps. The descent to the crater floor is 400 feet... the ascent back to the parking area via the counterclockwise direction involves hiking switchbacks which is easier than climbing uneven, high, and steep steps if one has taken the clockwise direction. If in relatively decent shape, allow approximately 2 to 2.5 hours. Elevation/altitude is about 4,000 feet. The interpretative map/guide is available for $2 at the park headquarters and is worthwhile. Pack a hat/cap, sunglasses, plenty of water and insect repellent.",March 2020,Kilauea Iki Trail,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g143034-d131308-Reviews-Kilauea_Iki_Trail-Hawaii_Volcanoes_National_Park_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",attractions,5.0,5.0
Local color - off the beaten path,Our Hawaiian friends took us here to experience some of the local color.

Best place to buy Mauna Loa products,"As others have pointed out, the farm/factory is not a ""tour"" although one can peer through the window to see the factory. This location is primarily a store/gift shop where you can get free tastings and the best prices on Mauna Loa products. We didn't believe the other reviewers about the prices being cheaper than Costco, WalMart, ABC and other stores, but it's true! We never knew there are 11 flavors of mac nuts; we have only seen a few of them heretofore: unsalted, lightly salted, Kona coffee, honey roasted, honey sriracha, mango chipotle, Maui onion and garlic, milk chocolate, milk chocolate coconut, milk chocolate toffee, and dark chocolate. The store offers other products as well including souvenirs, postcards, coffee, tea, jewelry, mugs, t-shirts, etc. Additionally, the store has a small cafe that serves reasonably priced food (e.g., hot dog) and ice cream. There were a lot of tour buses so it can get crowded.

Homecooking,"Great restaurant. Generous portions. Have loved this restaurant ever since we first ate here over 30 years ago. As soon as our plane landed and we got our rental car, we headed to Teshima's for lunch. We had shrimp tempura as an appetizer and then ordered two pupu trays for lunch.

Even Hilton's Hampton Inns serve a better breakfast,"We're Diamond Hilton members so we were given vouchers for the continental breakfast with the option to pay $6 per person to ""upgrade"" to the Aloha buffet. We took the upgrade option the first day but decided it wasn't worth the price. We would advise guests to eschew the buffet and either order off the menu or go to a nearby restaurant. We could not believe how sparse and meager the breakfast offerings were. Even Hilton's budget chain, Hampton Inns, offers a free breakfast that's much better than the breakfast at this Hilo hotel. The ""cold continental breakfast"" included an assortment of breads (white and wheat bread, bagels, English muffins, croissants, orange and blueberry muffins, Danish; cottage cheese; fruits (limit of 2 thin slices of papaya slices, pineapple, thawed honeydew melon, apples, oranges); cereals (Frosted Flakes, Raisin Bran, Special K, Rice Krispies); juice (orange and passo-guava); and yogurt. Not to be seen anywhere in the buffet area were peanut butter, bananas, granola, waffle iron (staples offered at other Hilton chains); some other Double Tree hotels include cold cuts and cheese... but not the Hilo Double Tree. Oatmeal is considered part of the hot buffet! Cost for the cold buffet was $16 per person! For an additional $6, one can upgrade to the hot buffet which included oatmeal, scrambled eggs, Portuguese sausage and bacon, breakfast potatoes, steamed white rice, and French toast.

Satisfying late afternoon meal,"We had spent the day hiking at Volcanoes National Park and returned to Hilo ravenous. We arrived for the HBC Afternoon Menu (in between lunch and dinner).

The fish of the day was swordfish and surprisingly, the fish N chips were moist. Along with the Cock N Bull Ginger Beer, the tab came to $64.93 including tax for the two of us.

Good food; odd service,"We were a party of 7 with reservations at noon. Five of us had arrived at 11:45 am and the hostess said she would seat us as soon as the remaining two arrived which they did about 5 minutes later.... to which the hostess said she wouldn't seat us until the stated reservation at noon -- in spite of the fact that it was a weekday, the restaurant was not at all crowded, and 6 other people had already been seated. We probably would have been seated earlier if we did not have reservations! We all thought this was odd. Food was decent enough - 4 out of 5 stars -- nothing really stellar. We ordered two crab dip appetizers; steak sandwich; 2 seafood louie salad; 2 mahi mahi stuffed with crab; 1 steelhead salmon; 1 cod and chips; iced tea; lemonade; Sprite; and 1 burnt cream.

We loved our pizzas; however, we found the salad dressings way too acidic - wasn't sure if there was any olive oil. Also, on the House salad, the candied pecans were missing so we asked for some.

The restaurant offers ""standard"" pizzas such as cheese, margheritas, meat pizzas, but we much prefer to add more vegetables. Doesn't matter what toppings one wants, the price is the same.

We reported the smoke to the front desk -- they seemed aware of the issue. More smoke wafting out of the room on the 2nd day/night.
Breakfast was a zoo. The hotel does forewarn guests about busy times during breakfast service. Many trays and coffee pots needed replenishing. No English muffins - just plain white/wheat bread; bagels; and some pastries/muffins. First day had chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy and reconstituted scrambled eggs.

Downhill from previous stay,"We stayed at the Hilton Santa Clara back in 2017 and had a satisfactory experience so we expected the same level of service when we returned in 2019. We are Diamond members and used the digital check-in feature for Room 733 but when we arrived at the hotel, they said the room wasn't available and put us in Room 714. The room hadn't been well cleaned -- many live and dead gnats on the window sill and some stuck on the wall by the bed. From our previous stay, we knew the Exec Lounge would be not as good as other Exec lounges in terms of snack offerings, but we hadn't anticipated that the coffee machine would be out of service. We had the breakfast buffet in the restaurant but that was awful -- the bowl of cheese was rancid. The server didn't believe us until we told him to smell the bowl and sample the cheese.

Odd layout; dark ambience; service lacking,"We were en route to San Diego but wanted to visit a friend who lives in Santa Clarita; hence, one night at this Hilton Garden Inn. The layout is not typical Hilton Garden Inn; it's almost as though Hilton took over an old hotel and turned it into a Hilton Garden Inn. The location of our room (280) required walking down a long hall on ground level to take an elevator different from main elevator. When we got to our room, we wanted to put our food which required refrigeration in the mini-fridge; however, we couldn't because the fridge hadn't been cleaned out. We called housekeeping to remove the items. Not a good first impression. As Diamond members, our breakfast was comp but I think we have had better and more appealing breakfasts at other Hilton Hampton Inns and Garden Inns. The hotel felt old, tired, and worn.

Customers could ask for a refund or board the boat and let the captain take us to other sites. Glad we chose to board the boat.

The coconut rum was lovely, and the vodkas were nice, but the biggest and most pleasant surprise was the delightful refreshing ginger gin which turned out to be a disappointment because the gin is currently only sold at the distillery. :-( We were hoping it would be available at liquor stores on the mainland... hope Ocean manufactures the gin for commercial sale soon!",November 2019,Ocean Vodka Organic Farm and Distillery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60633-d4259183-Reviews-Ocean_Vodka_Organic_Farm_and_Distillery-Kula_Maui_Hawaii.html,"Maui, Hawaii",attractions,5.0,4.5

All the dishes were excellent except for the flatbread Mediterranean salad. For our second dinner, we opted for the kale salad.

Before arriving at the farm, get a free copy of Upcountry Maui magazine and look for a $3 discount coupon which covers the entrance fee, not the guided tour portion.

Was horrified to see that we had to wait over an hour to board the funicular to Fira and saddened by how overrun the island was of tourists. Fortunately, hubby and I wanted to hike the 8+-mile trail from Fira to Oia and avoid the crowds. Because we were on a cruise ship, we could not get an early start. Our tender did not get to the port until way after 9:30 am and by the time we reached the start of the trail in Fira, it was past 11:00 am -- already too late and too warm for optimal hiking conditions -- but we persevered because we knew it was either now or never. It took us about 4 hours of hiking (we're senior citizens) before we found the bus stop in Oia. This was one of our top three highlights of our Greek adventure. The trail was not crowded once we got past Imerovigli. Wear sturdy walking shoes (paved, unpaved, rocky, cobblestoned paths), pack plenty of water, wear sunscreen and hat with wide rims.",September 2019,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d2368798-Reviews-Hiking_Trail_Fira_Oia-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Interesting museum if you have the time,"We were on an organized tour of the island which included a visit to this museum. It is a nicely curated and informative museum, especially given its compact size. One gets a glimpse of the geologic origins of Milos; the sociological, economic, and technological aspects of mining; and the various minerals which can be found on Milos.",September 2019,Milos Mining Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635606-d605981-Reviews-Milos_Mining_Museum-Adamas_Milos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Milos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Spectacularly gorgeous,"On our tour of Milos, we stopped at Sarakiniko Beach. The area is spectacularly scenic with the stark, white stone contrasted against a deep blue sea and sun-lit blue sky. Swimmers and sunbathers abound, as well as hikers.",September 2019,Sarakiniko Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g494953-d2171292-Reviews-Sarakiniko_Beach-Milos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Milos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worth the time and effort,"We were on a cruise ship and opted to go on the Delos tour rather than hang out in Mykonos (been there, done that decades ago). Good choice. The island is now uninhabited and requires taking a ferry from Mykonos to Delos. Once we disembarked, we met up with a tour guide who was quite informative. One got a sense of how bustling a place Delos was. Time permitting, it's worth a quick trip to the museum before boarding the boat back to Mykonos. Time on Delos was time well-spent.",September 2019,Archaeological Site of Delos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g202339-d4297568-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Delos-Delos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Delos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Interesting Meteora monastery,"Varlaam is the second largest of the 6 surviving monasteries. This monastery shows how the monks were able to ascend and descend using nets and ropes. There is a 16th century oak barrel which stored water as well as a small museum housing painted icons. Seven monks still live in the monastery. No photos allowed and one must wear modest clothes - no shorts, no sleeveless shirts.",September 2019,Varlaam Monastery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315843-d243301-Reviews-Varlaam_Monastery-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nunnery,Roussanou is one of 6 surviving monasteries out of the original 24. Today the venue is a nunnery. No photos are allowed but we were able to see the chapel and the gardens.

Tour group hotel,"This hotel was the least favorite of our tour group hotels... but thankfully, we didn't spend much time in our room since our group arrived before dinner and we checked out early morning after breakfast.

Decent hotel for tour group,We were part of a tour group that stayed in this hotel. The hotel was modern and the hallways stark. Decent room.

Spiritual,"We weren't prepared for the spirituality and energy we derived from visiting legendary Delphi. It is an amazing and fascinating archeological site. As you make your way up the Sacred Way, you'll walk past the Roman Forum. It's easy to miss the small cone-shaped Omphalos, between the Treasuries and the Treasury of the Athenians, which marks the center of the world. Continue walking and you'll reach the imposing Temple of Apollo. Look upwards towards the hills and you'll see people climbing towards the theater. If you are able-bodied, it's worth climbing to the theater; and, if you are fortunate, you'll get an inexplicable surge of energy which will take you beyond the theater to the Stadium. All the hiking from the entrance to the top where the stadium is and back down can be done within 2 hours. Wear sturdy walking shoes and bring water -- very little shade until you reach the stadium.",September 2019,Delphi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d523823-Reviews-Delphi-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
