Nothing can prepare you for the reality of being here,"We were totally blown away by the Acropolis - and that included the walks around the hill, not just the more famous sites on the top. There were lots of people there, even in mid-Winter, but the history and atmosphere transported us to a place where we hardly noticed them. But do make sure you also go up Philopappos Hill and the Hill of the Nymphs, to get incredible panoramic views (and photo-opps) of the Acropolis.",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Amazing food, great staff","We stayed just across the road from here and popped in a few times to buy various bits and pieces. The spinach pie and chicken pie were extraordinary, as was the bougatsa (both savoury and sweet). The staff were really friendly and helpful - and twice we got a portion of the sweet bougatsa added to our order at no extra cost. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.",December 2019,Creme Royale,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7715443-Reviews-Creme_Royale-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Outstanding food and great service - even when the place was heaving,"For our first ever visit to Cuzina, we went here for a birthday meal this week, the same evening that Forest were playing at home. Despite this and the place being absolutely rammed full, the reservation had been held. Even with a full restaurant, the service was perfect, prompt and attentive without being over-bearing. The food was absolutely fantastic, but special praise for the pitta and the lamb kleftiko. And at the end, the bill represented really good value for money.",December 2019,Cuzina Bar & Eatery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1749652-d12124266-Reviews-Cuzina_Bar_Eatery-West_Bridgford_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"West Bridgford, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Food an service to match the view,"12 of us had lunch there. Once we had got over the unbelievably beautiful location, we sat down to a set lunch menu. The food was uniformly excellent. Three of our party did not eat pork and one was vegetarian. They all were presented with excellent and imaginative alternatives. The service was perfect - attentive but not oppressive; and also slick and efficient. Great value for money at the end rounded off an amazing meal.",November 2019,Restaurante Mirador de La Pena,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187473-d1889044-Reviews-Restaurante_Mirador_de_La_Pena-El_Hierro_Canary_Islands.html,"El Hierro, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Still serves the best fish and chips in Nottingham,"We just love this place. The fish and chips are still the best in town (the fish would be even better if they would stop putting paprika in the fish, but don't let that put you off - it is not overpowering). To misquote Monty Python, the beers go without saying (they can be pricey, but hey - you are drinking some of the finest beers on the planet). Service was excellent, as always. The atmosphere was great - buzzy and lively. As a regular visitor now on their email list, I had received a voucher that gave us 50% off mains, making it incredible value.",January 2019,Belgo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186356-d10035273-Reviews-Belgo-Nottingham_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Unbelievably poor front of house,"We ate at Irie the very first day it was open. Front of house service was slow and the kitchen was so slow it took about an hour for the (excellent) food to come. We put it down to first-night teething troubles so went back last night to see how it was now. Oh dear. Having asked if they had a table, the front of house staff (the full set, they were not under-staffed) then seemed to immediately lose interest in us and busied themselves doing other things. Eventually they did seat us, at no point speaking directly with us. We sat down, made our decisions and waited for someone to come and take our order. And waited. And waited. And tried and failed to make eye contact. Repeatedly. In the end we got up and left. I have never had such a bad service experience as at Irie. Downstairs at least, where the front of house staff were all grouped, there are not that many covers. There were enough staff to handle the flow of custom. So what they found to do, instead of dealing with customers, I have no idea. They really need to get a grip on staff training or they will not be around much longer.",January 2019,Irie & Co,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186356-d15121103-Reviews-Irie_Co-Nottingham_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Best Indian restaurant in Nottingham,"You know you are in for a treat when the sides and starters are outstanding. The poppadums tasted fab and the naan, rice and assorted pickles tasted of real traditions and cooked to perfection. Our mains were lamb dishes and both were great in different ways.
Service as usual attentive and genial, and probably the most pleasant and relaxed maitre d' in town.",July 2016,The Cumin Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186356-d1316779-Reviews-The_Cumin_Restaurant-Nottingham_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Belgian restaurant well worth searching for,"This part of town was new to me when I went looking for somewhere to eat recently. Le Bugatti looked great from the outside, with some nice art nouveau features to the building. The menu looked great and very reasonably priced, so I decided to give it a go. I plumped for the rabbit cooked in kriek (rather than the gueuze I am more familiar with). To go with this, I went with the kriek from Boon, a new brewery to me. OMG (as the youngsters might say). It was one of the most wonderfully flavoursome dishes of food I have had in a very long time. And amazing value for money at â‚¬13.50. The Boon kriek was also quite superb, with loads of cherry flavour, but without being overly sweet.

For pud I went for the home-made waffle and home-made chantilly cream. Again, the quality was on another level. To go with this, I asked for advice from the very friendly and helpful waitress between two beers that were strong, but were described in the menu as having sweeter notes than the others. She advised me to have the Malheur 10 - and very good advice it was too.

Overall? Amazing food, at fantastic prices, with a really interesting range of beers that include several not on the usual tourist beer-map of Brussels.",June 2016,Le Bugatti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1136493-d1373168-Reviews-Le_Bugatti-Ixelles_Brussels.html,"Ixelles, Belgium",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great location to explore Venice,"We stayed here for a week over New Year, Staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was a bit small, but all windows opened and was decorated in a manner that reflected the age and beauty of the building. We were in the new part - only 400 years old. The heating in the room was very effective - when we arrived back after hours of walking we turned up the thermostat and the radiators responded immediately.

The mod cons in the bathroom were very lavishly provided, notably fresh towels provided very frequently, although it was a bit cramped and without a window. Unlike many places we looked at on the internet when booking, all rooms are en-suite. We also felt it was good value, compared with other hotels we looked at.

The room was extremely clean - and cleaned daily to a much higher standard than is often the case. There were plenty of spare pillows and (important, as we were there for New Year) extra blankets. Most important of all, the twin beds were excellent. They were pushed together to make a double but, unlike some other reviewers, this caused us no problems at all.

We chose not to have the breakfast but eat out, so cannot comment on the quality and value for money of the breakfast. Nor did we use the Wi-Fi, so I cannot comment on that either.

The location was fantastic, with great shops, cafes and restaurants nearby, the Rialto Bridge 10 minutes walk away, but only 15 minutes walk from the Bus Station (Piazzale Roma).

The only problem with the room was that the plumbing, including the toilet, from other rooms passed close by us through the wall.",December 2015,Ferretti Ca' San Polo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187870-d291696-Reviews-Ferretti_Ca_San_Polo-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.5
