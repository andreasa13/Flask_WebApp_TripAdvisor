Stunning Views/Wonderful Food,Everything we were told about this beautiful waterfront restaurant was true. The views are simply stunning. The service was excellent. The food was mouthwatering. We truly could not have asked for a better evening.,October 2019,Apaggio Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g667488-d6499099-Reviews-Apaggio_Restaurant-Ornos_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Total Letdown,"Just some context before the review. I booked and arranged our itinerary for Greece a full 8 months in advance which included researching restaurants and making reservations. Naoussa, because of the excellent view of the Caldera, was recommended and it’s a Greek Restaurant so why not.

For our final night, we chose to dine here, but it was such a huge disappointment. No live music but the views are stunning. That’s the only highlight. The waiter took our order, delivered our food and forgot about us the rest of the night. Another reviewer had a similar experience. The meals were not good and about two hours later, I had thrown up all the food. I had the lemon chicken with potatoes and my husband had the souvlaki that he said was poorly seasoned. He did not get sick from his meal.

I didn’t eat the full dinner because something tasted off which I was right about. After 15min of eating, we wanted to leave. It took another 30min just to get our bill. I think the restaurant could not keep up with the two large groups they had because they didn’t have enough staff. That so much wouldn’t bother me if the food was great.",October 2019,Naoussa Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d1067977-Reviews-Naoussa_Restaurant-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Great Location/Room....,"I booked this particular premise because it is located in the heart of Fira. I love the fact that I can walk to all the restaurants, shops, and the 24 hour bakery. The actual place isn’t all that great for a couple of reasons.

Similar to another reviewer, our room was located off the back alleyway. We did not feel comfortable walking back there at night. While the entry way was lit, there are other accommodations that don’t belong to San Giorgio along that same alleyway, and they do not light their entry way.

Secondly, the washroom is super tiny with the sink located in front of the bed. The shower is adjacent to the toilet which is only separated by a glass that is the length of the toilet. Everytime you shower water gets on the floor. Thankfully, they have daily housekeeping. The washroom was always damp as the exhaust fan is poor quality. There is a green light located in the bedroom that we associated with some sort of fire detector (we could be wrong). Imagine sleeping with a green light in your face all night. My husband had to cover it with his shirt.

Lastly, be prepared to haul your luggage along the cobblestone alleyway. It’s a bit of a steep hill but we managed.

I do love the fact that they have a shuttle service and check in/check out was seamless.",October 2019,San Giorgio Villa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d590947-Reviews-San_Giorgio_Villa-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.5
Stunning View,"My husband and I visited Argo a few days ago and it was everything we expected, stunning view, excellent service, and fabulous food. It truly doesn’t get any better.

We had the Santorini salad, shrimp pasta, and spinach and ricotta ravioli. What made the ravioli special was the honey, cream, and walnut sauce. That combination is mouthwatering.",October 2019,Argo Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d1105505-Reviews-Argo_Restaurant-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful History,"This is really the main attraction aside from Little Venice and I’m glad we got to see it in person. Don’t waste your money getting an organized tour to see it. You can take the bus into town and it’s short, 5-10min walk away.

The Windmills itself are beautiful and a must see. After that though, there really isn’t much else to it.",October 2019,The Windmills (Kato Milli),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g662620-d669289-Reviews-The_Windmills_Kato_Milli-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Modern and Excellent Beach Access,"My husband and I stayed here, and it was everything that we wanted: excellent and quick access to the beach, modern amenities, and excellent service.

Because of the strike in Athens that delayed our ferry, we lost one night out of four. I called the receptionist in a panic and she was so reassuring that it was ok and we wouldn’t lose our room. We checked in seamlessly and a staff member helped us to our room carrying our luggage. We had a double room with a sea view. Our room had its own patio with tables so you could sit and admire the view while having a drink. The room itself is modern with grey oversized tile, large shower, separate room for the toilet.

The restaurant on site is convenient while seating is limited. That’s ok because there is endless seating outside. Just across the street is Paradise Beach. Because of the quick access to the beach is why this hotel was chosen out of the many.

There is a bus stop just a 2 minute walk away that takes you directly into Mykonos Town. The bus ride is about 10 to 15 minutes.

The shuttle service is such a wonderful service to provide to your guests. We used it to and from. Thank you!",October 2019,Tropicana Hotel Mykonos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g662620-d2658055-Reviews-Tropicana_Hotel_Mykonos-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent Food and Staff,"My husband and I were stuck in Athens for an extra night because the strike delayed our ferry. We stayed at a nearby hotel and were looking for somewhere to eat. We found Porto Grill and all the reviews were great.

We were immediately greeted with a smile and seated at a table. The waiter engaged in conversation with us that made us feel welcomed. The food was divine and mouthwatering. If you are in the area, then check it out. You won’t be disappointed.

We started off with a salad and the best falafel I’ve EVER had. We had the chicken portion gyros that we ate even before I remembered to take a picture; it was that good.",October 2019,Porto Grill Piraeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189403-d10665372-Reviews-Porto_Grill_Piraeus-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent Service!,"We booked our ferry to Mykonos and used Blue Star Ferries. Unfortunately, due to the strike in Athens which halted our ferry, we were stranded. The staff at the office were as helpful as can be even with the limited information they had. They changed our ticket for the next day.

The next day, the ferry departed on time. We were able to store our luggage in the luggage room so we could roam free without being hindered. The hot meals and drinks for sale were great! The staff are helpful.",October 2019,Blue Star Ferries,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189403-d8703917-Reviews-Blue_Star_Ferries-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.5
Short Stat,"This was a last minute booking because of the strike in Athens that resulted in our ferry to Mykonos being delayed 24 hours. The hotel is about a 5min walk from the Port which is why we chose it. The area surrounding the hotel is undesirable, but it’s close to the Port.

I was able to book a triple room in Expedia because that’s all that was left but we ended up getting a double. I don’t even care that I paid more money for a room I didn’t get; I’m just grateful that the receptionist displayed empathy to our highly stressful situation and got us into a room way prior to the check-in time.

The hotel itself is clean and has a breakfast option that starts very early in the morning (5:30am) for 9 Euro.",October 2019,Hotel Triton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189403-d285929-Reviews-Hotel_Triton-Piraeus_Piraeus_Region_Attica.html,"Piraeus, Greece",hotels,4.0,3.5

Luxurious R&R stay,"My husband and I stayed here during Canada Day long weekend, and all of our expectations were exceeded. I emailed the owners after my booking and a received prompt response. We were provided simple, check-in process and greeted with a warm welcome card. They provide a full spread of hot and cold breakfast made by one of the owners, Guy. He is a brilliant chef. You get to choose what you would liked personally prepared each morning of your stay. Who doesn’t want that kind of pampering!?!

We stayed in the Birch room that had its own individually controlled air-conditioning unit with a ceiling fan. The bathroom has modern amenities and heated tile floor. It doesn’t get any better than that after stepping out of the shower.

The house is traditional with modern, contemporary, and chic interior design that is truly stunning. If you’re looking for a personalized stay that is only a 4 minute drive from Scandinave Spa, then stay here! Definitely add the spa package to your stay. You’ll thank me for it! My husband and I were there from 10am to 5:30pm and it was simply blissful. Book a massage if you can too.

Guy and Craig, thank you for opening up your home and making us feel comfortable and welcomed.

The disappointment is real,"Stay: December 15, 2018 to December 22, 2018.

Disclaimer: this review is to assist fellow travellers like myself make well-informed decisions on where to stay during a holiday. We all spend a lot of money to patronage a business, so we must do our due diligence in sharing experiences. While I don’t expect perfection (although I rightly should), I do expect a level of standard of care that reflects the cost of my stay. Sit back and have a drink as this is a lengthy review.

Let’s start with the negatives so we can end on a positive note:

1. Blood stained bed sheets: on our second morning, my husband and I woke up and noticed old blood stained on the sheets. We immediately walked over to the front desk to report our findings. We were reassured that housekeeping would change the linens that morning, and received the one and only apology during this entire debacle from Nayo, the cashier who overheard our complaint to the guy we reported the issue.

My husband and I went about our day partaking in a half day excursion. We returned at approximately 4pm to notice
that the sheets the “new” sheets they used also had blood stains on it. We called front desk to advise, and was once again assured that housekeeping would immediately attend to the matter. They didn’t show up until 5:30pm, after my 2nd phonecall at 5:22pm.

Housekeeping came. She was preparing our bed and noticed yet another stain on the sheets she came with. She left to get new sheets. She came back yet again to prepare our bed. Yet again she noticed stains on the sheets she came with. In her rightful annoyance she stated, “it’s so hard to find clean sheets in this place.” *insert heart slinking here *

Housekeeping comes back and makes our bed with what we think are clean sheets. The next morning, my husband and I notice another blood stain on the top sheet. We remove that only to expose yet another bloodstain on the second sheet. We remove that which exposes the mattress pad. To my horror, the mattress pad is stained with bodily fluids. I’m exasperated at this point. We remove that only to expose a bloodstained mattress. *insert upset stomach here* Travellers, this mattress is in room 2129.

What couldn’t be more perfect timing at 7:45am, front desk calls and asks if everything is now ok with our room. I tell her, Natassa, about our findings and request a new mattress or room. She requests that we follow up with her at 8:30am after she speaks with housekeeping. We follow up. Natassa states that she hasn’t yet spoken to housekeeping, and requests that we follow up in an hour.

We have breakfast and follow up at 9:30am. Natassa advises that they will change our room and to check back at 2pm. My husband and I try to enjoy our beach day and follow up at 2:30pm only to be told our new room needs another 15min. What’s 15 more minutes at this point, right? We pack up our stuff from 2129 and head to our new room, 2224, at 2:51pm to see housekeeping making our bed. We wait outside. About 8min later, housekeeping exits the rooms and sees me sitting on my luggage in the hallway. She asks if I need anything. I say I’m waiting for the room.

She hurriedly tried to fix up the room. I immediately inspect the sheets. They’re new out the box as they should be at this point but the mattress pad has what appears to be a bloodstain. Housekeeping says it’s from the iron *insert eye roll here* I ask her to remove it. She does and places a regular sheet saying she’ll bring a mattress pad the next day which she did. Room 2224 is a poolview so thank you Natassa for the upgrade. Otherthan the view, 2224 is the exact same room as 2129.

2. Pigeon feces infested beach chairs: the picture speaks for itself. To RIU Management: a lot of people are looking for employment. Why don’t you pay someone to clean the beach chairs daily so your guests aren’t laying on bird s**t? I get the birds rest in the trees that provide shade to your guests, but with that comes daily maintainence of the beach chairs. Goodluck travellers trying to find one that doesn’t have bird feces on it. It’s disgusting. I don’t care if my beach towel will cover it. For a hotel chain like the RIU not to clean the beach chairs is utterly ridiculous.

3. Dead mouse in front of a la carte restaurant, Kulinarium: I just have no words. We reported it immediately to staff who was working next door at the Asian restaurant, Mandalay, as we walked towards breakfast. As we left breakfast, the dead mouse was still there. I can’t at this point. To credit of the resort, I never saw any mice roaming anywhere. It was probably killed by a cat who wanted to show off its prize like cats do.

4. The beach: human beings can sometimes be the worst. If you smoke, then that’s your prerogative but don’t be lazy and throw out your cigarette butts in the sand. Walk 10 steps and throw it out properly. The water is NOT clear one bit (it’s muddy and murky), and as you walk in, you feel like you’re sinking into mud. There’s a lot of seaweed at the bottom. As one reviewer advised, the bay that the RIU occupies is a man-made beach (I had no idea), so that’s why you feel like your sinking into mud. Not sure what the RIU can do about that.

Phew. Ok. Now that’s done, let’s talk about the positives which accounts for the two starts I gave this review.

1. Service: Check in was seamless. Greeted with a refreshing drink. Finished check-in after approximately 5-8min of arrival. Staff always made me feel welcome by greeting us with a smile, offering service, and going out their way. Specifically, during breakfast, lunch, and dinner, we were always asked if they could do/get us anything. Otis deserves absolute commendation for going out of his way to remember what we like at each meal and going out of his way to make each meal special. Thank him for getting one of the stars in this review.

2. Food: BRAVO! Everything we ate was EXCELLENT. My husband and I are travel addicts, foodies, and are well equipped to compare food from one resort to another. Do not change a thing otherthan offering oxtail and ackee and saltfish more. We loved the taste and constant variety of options in the buffet that we did not feel the need to try the speciality restaurants. We chose not to because 3 out of the 4 are all buffet so what’s the point!?! The one table-side service restaurant had the dead mouse in front so that wasn’t going to happen. Also, the menu wasn’t appealing.

This was lengthy, but I really hope management takes heed to this review and makes some much needed changes. When your own staff complains about the lack of clean sheets, that’s a serious problem. Train your housekeeping not to mask bedding that has blood on it. That’s not too much to ask and employ someone to clean your beach chairs daily. We pay a lot of money to stay at your property. Put that to use and implement a high standard of care.",December 2018,Hotel Riu Negril,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147313-d478349-Reviews-Hotel_Riu_Negril-Negril_Westmoreland_Parish_Jamaica.html,Jamaica,hotels,3.0,4.0
Exceptional Service and Attention,"My husband I just recently visited on May 20, 2018 to May 27, 2018 with Sunwing. From the airport, the coach bus ride was about 30-40min. We arrived very early in the morning around 10:30am not expecting our room to be ready as check in is at 4pm. Upon arrival, we were asked to sit down on the lounge and were provided with a champagne cocktail and cold hand towel. Amazing.

After about 4min for check-in, we were introduced to our butler, Gabriel, who showed us around and informed us that our room was ready. We were ecstatic. He escorted us to our room (number 3011). Our room looked exactly like the website (Gardenview Room). Your butler is there for anything you need. While it’s a nice service to have, we didn’t utilize him other than one occasion for which we asked for bottles of water (we didn’t ours one night for the next day).

After about 10min, the bellmen delivered our luggage. We promptly changed, grabbed lunch at the Bistro, and headed to the beach. The beach is immaculately kept. We never had an issue finding a beach chair. The water was cool but since it was hot for the majority of our stay, we didn’t mind the cool water. Hardly any seaweed and the water only gets deep further and further away. We never visited the pool as we are a beach couple, so I can only say that on appearance, it is beautiful.

There are four a la carte restaurants, and we visited three: Italian, Tex Mex, and Caribbean. The food was fantastic at all three. I especially enjoyed the guitarist and violinist who played literally every song a guest requested without music sheets. I requested Ave Maria. Their talent was awe-inspiring.

The buffet was hit and miss. The first day we had lunch there it was terrible (no seasoning, food cold), but dinner that evening was fine. Breakfast was great as I could get my eggs cooked at the omelet station exactly how I want. During dinner there was a crepe station and we literally had a freshly made crepe every night. In the buffet there is a pizza/pasta station which was so-so, a seafood station (I never tried it but my husband did and he wasn’t too much of a fan), a meat station, and a cold cut/cheese station. I never had a meal at the buffet that I classified as amazing, but the restaurants really redeemed the food at the resort. The meat used for the hamburgers and hot dogs are mystery meat. I get it’s Cuba and we can’t expect North American standards, so I just chose not to eat it after two tries.

The beach restaurant is terrible. The food was always cold and lacked seasoning. The service was terribly slow. Cats, three of them, walk around the restaurant and literally sit beside you, under your table looking for food. It’s a complete turn off. A few times we witnessed the cats climb on its hind legs and approach the top of the table. It’s gross. Patrons need to stop feeding them. It’s not their natural environment for food. You’re only making it worse.

The Bistro (24 hour snack bar) had good food, but they did need to do something about the birds. Because it is outdoors and stupid humans feed them, they continue to fly back and perch themselves on the table looking for your meal. Literally I had a bird fly onto my plate while I was eating. I recommend covering the patio someway so guests can enjoy their meal without a bird attacking their plate.

There’s a huge Sunwing office, so if you need anything, your rep is there during their hours. We purchased two excursions (day trip to Havana/Tropicana Show and Catamaran sail to Cayo Blanco). We purchased prior to departure so we paid in CDN funds. Both excursions were great although the buffet lunch provided during the Catamaran beach day was lacklustre and birds eyeing your plate.

It’s an adult only resort and we love that. The nightly entertainment was ok and helped pass the time. The lobby bar is 24 hours and the atmosphere is amazing. All white decor. It’s beautiful and airy.

All the servers and staff deserve an award. I’ve been to plenty AI resorts and cruises and by far, Royalton takes the cake. Exceptional service. Exceptional attention. We never had a dirty plate sit in front of us longer than 2min at the buffet. As soon as you sit down someone is asking if you want water, coffee, tea, wine, etc. Our first day there Mary asked us for our opinion on the food and we received a survey to fill out on the third day I believe. I personally was not put off by that because that shows they care about what you think. Anyone complaining about the surveys must have no problems in life. If the resort never asked for your opinion, then you’d complain. You can win with people like that.

As for the weather, the last day and a half was rain, rain, and rain unbeknownst to us because of Tropical Storm Alberto. We stayed in our room during that time and made the best of it.

My recommendation to Sunwing: don’t tell customers the bus will arrive at 6:30am when you know it won’t be there until an hour later. Our checkout was 6am and we literally sat there for 1.5 hours just waiting. We would appreciate the time to sleep in or grab an early breakfast heading back to the airport.

Because of our stay at the Royalton, we have been spoiled and will only stay with the Royalton brand going forward at other destinations.",June 2018,Royalton Hicacos Varadero Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147275-d270082-Reviews-Royalton_Hicacos_Varadero_Resort_Spa-Varadero_Matanzas_Province_Cuba.html,Cuba,hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent Fun and Service,"I booked the tour online for March 31, 2018 and it was a easy, simple process. Immediately received confirmation. I sent an email asking to be picked up at their office since we were not staying overnight in the area. I received a response right away.

Peter, our tour guide, promptly picked up my husband and I at 1:30pm. There were three other couples on the tour. Peter was immensely professional, personable, and social. He’s hilarious and there’s no way you cannot laugh while on this tour.

We visited four wineries: Between The Lines, Konzelmann, Small Talk, and Palatine and came home with 8 bottles of wine. I love the fact that they visit the smaller wineries and during a time it’s not packed.

Outstanding Wine and Service,"My husband and I along with my husband's 5 cousins decided to partake in the Niagara Wine Festival with our Discovery Pass on Saturday, September 16, 2017 while celebrating my cousin-in-law's 34th birthday.

Kacaba was our 3rd stop out of 8 visits and by far, we had the BEST experience at Kacaba. David, our host, was simply.....amazing. His personality, humour, attentiveness, drive, and service-focused professionalism all lead to each and every single one of us to have a spectacular time. He explained the wine and culinary pairing down to each ingredient and the wine....it was divine. The food was mouth-watering. Kudos to the chef. David continually and regularly checked up on us to ensure we were good and if we needed anything else to try. It's service like that which creates a fantastic customer experience and continued business. We all said we would travel from Toronto back to Niagara to go back to Kacaba.

Great Excursion,"I booked this tour company for my husband and I after extensive research into the various companies out there travelling to the Grand Canyon. We are thoroughly glad with Grand Canyon Destinations. I received two reminder emails and a final confirmation email regarding time and place of pick up the night before. The driver, Troy, was responsible, informative, professional, and takes pride in his work. We explained our itinerary for the day and he repeatedly reviewed drop off and pickup points at the Grand Canyon so no one gets lost.

The lunch was exactly as described and is more than filling. The lunch consisted of a full sized sandwich, an apple, chips, sample sized chocolate bar, and a cookie. The bus had more than enough cases of water for the entire full size group so you don't have to bring your own. We had 15min at the Hoover Dam and 3 hours at the Grand Canyon (South Rim). The bus itself was huge, clean, leather seats with seat belts, foot rest, and spacious. Think of a Coach bus; that is what we got. I was happy.

As for the South Rim, it was spectacular. It's definitely a must see. You have more than enough time to walk the 4km trail which is what we did. The scenery is amazing.

As for timing, it's a long tour. We started at 6am and got back to our hotel on the strip (Aria) at 9:05pm. I wouldn't recommend booking anything to do after your tour. You'll be exhausted. The bus ride is long.

The food portions are incredibly small considering the high price tag for a meal. It's just not worth it. My fiancé had the chicken and waffles for $33. That's crazy. On top of that, they only offer half of a waffle. I had the $22 pizza. Insane, I know. The size of the pizza doesn't come close to charging $22.",October 2016,The One Eighty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d707679-Reviews-The_One_Eighty-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Toronto, Canada",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Good Food but Pricey,"My fiancé and some friends attended for our normal get together. We ate on their rooftop patio. The rooftop was nice with umbrella to block some of the sun. My fiancé and I had the burger that cost $27 each that was accompanied by purple, yellow, and sweet potato chips. I think that's way overpriced. The burger was delicious and juicy. It's handmade with herbs inside. After sharing a dessert and ordering one glass of sangria and one spirit, dinner was $107 after a 15% tip. I'm not sure I would go again with such high prices. The service was excellent. I cannot remember her name but she's Polish and extremely professional.

Divinely Mouthwatering,This was my second visit. This time my fiancé and I brought my friend and her fiancé. The food will never disappoint. This is not the visit to count calories. The chicken is succulent and the waffles are fluffy and moist. You can't go wrong.

Great resort with mixed feelings,"My fiancé and I stayed April 9 to April 16, 2016. I'll start with the pros:

1) The grounds of the resort are simply stunning. They upkeep the gardens, trees, grass excellently. The flamingos and peacocks are beautiful.

2) The pool looks fantastic. My fiancé and I are ocean lovers, so we didn't spend anytime in the pool. Why do that when you have nature's water feet away.

3) The beach was lovely especially when the seaweed was cleared. The first day on the beach you could prominently smell the foul odour but the subsequent times the smell was gone. The water itself has a fair bit but we swam in the clearer aides.

4) We initially stayed in room 7010 with a garden view which was a lovely view. The decor is a bit outdated but it was clean and that's what I care about.

Now to the con: we booked a king bed 6mons prior to our stay but got two double beds which was frustrating. Upon check in on the Saturday, the receptionist stated to come back the next day to get a new room. When we attended on Sunday, the same receptionist advised her manager stated they received no such request (insert side eye here). I informed them we were there to celebrate our anniversary on April 11 and this setback was frustrating. I asked to speak with the manager but apparently she wasn't on site. A supervisor came out to advise they could accommodate us on the Tuesday and would upgrade our room to a pool view on the top floor (room 7214). The room decor was still a bit outdated but great pool view. Wifi access was severely limited in the new room while it was consistent in room 7010.

Restaurants: We didn't enjoy the food at the Mexican or Brazilian spots. We actually left mid way once we tasted the entrees. The meats at the Brazilian spot was dry and lacked seasoning. The tacos at the Mexican spot had a taste that didn't sit right with my stomach so to avoid getting sick, we didn't continue. The Japanese spot was the most decent and very entertaining.

Buffets: the food was decent but the one by the pool needs to do something about the birds. They fly in and perch themselves on the cold bar eating away at the cheese, desserts, and sandwiches. This is the food we are to eat and the staff does nothing about it. The food remains on the counter until some unsuspecting human grabs it for consumption. It's disgusting.

The lasting impression was positive. The staff were excellent. The customer service was great. The mishap on our room was met with no attitude by guest services. They even provided a birthday cake as a surprise on my fiance's birthday in our room which I appreciated. Would I go back, yes if I wanted to stay in Puerto Plata again.

Do note that outside the resort and Puerto Plata in general is underdeveloped with not much nightlife, malls, bars, clubs, or restaurants. We booked many excursions to occupy our time.",April 2016,Iberostar Costa Dorada,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147290-d150815-Reviews-Iberostar_Costa_Dorada-Puerto_Plata_Puerto_Plata_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,hotels,4.0,4.5
Outstanding,"We booked Paradise Island with this company from home prior to arriving in Puerto Plata. Communication was swift and got our tickets within 24 hours. Emilio was our guide for the day and he is outstanding, knowledgeable, fluent in many languages, and hilarious. This tour was $59 US whereas other tour companies charged $70 and up with the exact same accompaniments.",April 2016,Top3Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147290-d5505043-Reviews-Top3Tours-Puerto_Plata_Puerto_Plata_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,attractions,5.0,4.5
Breathtaking,"We booked Paradise Island via speed boat. This is a sandbank in the Atlantic Ocean and is simply stunning. The water is crystal clear, literally. You can go snorkelling and view the massive array of fishes. It's so romantic. My fiancé and I went as part of an excursion. This is definitely a must see.",April 2016,Key Paradise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147290-d2159363-Reviews-Key_Paradise-Puerto_Plata_Puerto_Plata_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,attractions,5.0,4.5
Extreme Excursion,"This is NOT for those who are out of shape and not in good physical health. We did the 12 falls and the hike was about 25min. Our guide was Chi Chi. Do yourself a favour. If you can reserve a guide, reserve Chi Chi. He didn't just lead us to the falls. He taught us about the trees and plants during our hike. He allowed us to take breaks. Once we got to the falls, he literally calmed my fears of the water as I don't know how to swim. I literally couldn't slide down without him being at the bottom to guide me in the deep water. I am entirely grateful for this once in a lifetime experience. It was worth the hike and it was worth all the anxiety leading up to it.

The waterfalls are stunning. Nature at its best. Do yourself a favour and book this excursion. We arrive at 2pm and returned to the front gate at 4:30pm. It's a long day but worth it.",April 2016,27 Charcos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147290-d627325-Reviews-27_Charcos-Puerto_Plata_Puerto_Plata_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,attractions,5.0,4.5
Exhilarating,My fiancé and I booked the Terracross. The company is great. Kelly and Pedro were our guides. Fantastic service. Drinks and sandwiches were provided. We even stopped at a river to swim a bit. That was a lovely surprise. They took us to a local's house to see how they live in the countryside. It's very humbling. The owner even gave all of us coconut water right out of the coconut. It was great knowing the money we spent goes partly to the owners of the land we were driving on.

Fantastic Service,"Why book with a third party when you can book directly with Country World. We booked the VIP package (horseback riding, zip-lining, and the 12 falls). It was a very long day but Dieter and his staff were exceptional. The traditional Dominican lunch was great after a horseback riding and zip-lining.

Ugh. Not worth it at all.,"My boyfriend and I stayed here April 5 to April 12 and I wish I had not stayed here. It's not a 4.5 star resort at all. It's more like 2.5/3 star. Please save yourself the headache and stay somewhere else for the many reasons that follow:

1. Accommodation: we were initially provided room 2220 which was a double bed/resort view. I had requested a king bed/ocean. 2220 was so outdated. The grout in the bathroom made me not even want to be barefoot. It was dirty and grimy. We complained and got room 3103. The bathroom was somewhat cleaner but the room needs updating. We feel that because there are only a few all inclusive resorts in Curacao and because Sunscape is slightly cheaper compared to the others, the management team at Sunscape are aware of this and they are slacking in a few areas purposely.

2. Service: it's a hit and miss. One wait staff may be pleasant one day and the next day, it's difficult to get someone to serve you water. I was so annoyed one time at breakfast that I got up and went to the water jugs that were hidden in the corner myself to get our drinks.

3. Restaurants: Bluewater Grill..... it took a hour to receive our main course and when we did, it wasn't what we asked for. We requested a medium steak but we got a well done steak. The Japanese restaurant: the cook is very funny, great experience having him cook in front of us. The atmosphere was was great. But the food was just good. In terms of authentic food...... The noodles..... is not noodles; it's spaghetti. The proteins were good. We sat down in front of the chef with other guests from the hotel debating if it was noodles or pasta. The only issue we had with the Italian restaurant is the authenticity of food was questionable.

There should be a station that offers food for 24 hours. This is the first time at an ""all inclusive"" that I've been to that didn't offer a 24 hour food station, even if they just offer chips and dip, hot dogs and hamburgers. As a guest at Sunscape, I should not be told that I have to wait for a hour to get something to eat, especially when I just got back from an excursion. Cuba is a poorer country and their resorts offer food 24 hours per day.

4. The Drinks....Jamaica, Barbados, they know how to mix drinks. We love to party and we LOVE to drink. In Canada when myself, family, and friends who are from the Caribbean tell others who are planning for go to the Caribbean, we tell them that you'll receive a ""real"" drink"", when you get down there. 80% alcohol with 20% juice/pop. When you are at a party in Canada, they don't serve you drinks like how Caribbean people do. There isn't much alcohol in the cup. Unfortunately, Sunscape Resort in Curacao does not stand up with the rest of the Caribbean. Sunscape Resort Curacao serves Canadian drinks...... 30% alcohol 60% juice /pop. I had conversations with others on the resort on this matter and the feelings are mutual. I feel that the servers are told to be cheap with the drinks because when I asked them to add more alcohol to my drink, they are very hesitate. The maple syrup at breakfast is water down and I am sure the resort makes enough money to supply their guests with 100% maple syrup not 40% maple syrup.

5. Plumbing/Housekeeping: the washroom needs updating in terms of plumbing. The hot water is very inconsistent and the toilet handle keeps getting stuck which keeps it running after it is flushed. I called reception when I got back from our catamaran fail to report we had no hot water in our washroom. She said she would send someone over to check it out. No one came. We also noticed that our bed sheets weren't being changed daily. We know that because there is a stain on the sheet since Tuesday.

6. The beach: it's gorgeous. However, it's cut off to prevent swimmers from going out too far since there is no life guard. That makes it feel very small.

7. Entertainment: *sigh* There is no nightclub. There were live musicians each night playing/singing old covers. That's the jist of it. We are in our 30s and want something that attracts to our age group. If you're looking for a great night life with young couples, Sunscape isn't it.

8. Creepy-crawly: a lizard entered our room one evening. We opened the door and there it was walking. My boyfriend was the hero and got it out. The manager heard my screams and said he would have our room sprayed. That never happened. The Friday night of our stay, a roach was in the bathroom behind the toilet. My BF killed it and flushed it down the toilet.

The best time of our stay was outside the resort. The people are so friendly and kind. The island is absolutely stunning. We did 5 excursions out of the 7 days we were in Curacao and that made our trip (see my review about Touracao Tourism and Aquafari). We love the island so much we are going to save to buy a property there in 5 years.",April 2015,Sunscape Curacao Resort Spa & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147278-d254238-Reviews-Sunscape_Curacao_Resort_Spa_Casino-Willemstad_Curacao.html,Curaçao,hotels,2.0,4.0
