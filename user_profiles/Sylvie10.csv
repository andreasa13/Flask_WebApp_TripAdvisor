Lovely little German bistro,"My daughter and I ate here on our one night stay in Rothenburg, really quaint little German bistro with good hearty food. The wine was from an excellent local selection. Service was very good, the waiting staff very hospitable and we weren't rushed despite taking a table reserved for later that evening after having stopped on the off chance. Highly recommended.",March 2020,Restaurant Alter Keller,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187319-d1466115-Reviews-Restaurant_Alter_Keller-Rothenburg_Middle_Franconia_Franconia_Bavaria.html,"Rothenburg, Germany",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Lovely atmosphere, worth a visit","We had read good reviews on this pub and decided to have a meal there on the last night of our break in mundesley. On arrival we were told by the landlord that a table magician was entertaining that night and he didn't disappoint! Brilliant fun! The food was really tasty, a good selection of pasta and pizza dishes plus great selection of wine and beers. Definitely recommend, oh and dog friendly!",February 2020,The Trunch Crown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503733-d4216736-Reviews-The_Trunch_Crown-North_Walsham_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"North Walsham, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0

"Decent, tasty local food","We were tempted to try out to Kati Allo after reading a number of good reviews and we weren't disappointed. The food is all on display and the owner patiently explains what is on the menu. We had caramelised aubergine and onions, lovely rich flavours and stuffed peppers.

Breathtaking,"The most incredible experience to walk to the top of the acropolis and see the breathtaking views below. Be warned, trainers are a must as the marble has been worn smooth in places and take a water bottle with you to fill, there are water fountains at the top. Beautiful by night too, the whole place is lit up.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing experience,"Really loved this place, absolutely awesome experience! When you climb the stairs to the top to look over the whole arena the view is simply breath taking!

Wow!,"What can I say? From start to finish the highlight of an amazing day in Athens, what fabulous hospitality and food!

Lovely last minute find,"Let down last minute by another pub restaurant in the area, it looked like our family reunion was about to go down the pan. However, The Rose and Crown came to the rescue and fitted all 8 of us in with very short notice. The food was typical pub grub but a good menu, well cooked and good size portions. Very happy with our meal here.",August 2019,The Rose and Crown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1577375-d4027710-Reviews-The_Rose_and_Crown-Stansted_Mountfitchet_Essex_England.html,"Stansted Mountfitchet, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
