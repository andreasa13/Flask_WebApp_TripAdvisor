Don’t miss this hill,"This is the hill you see all the photographers gathering to get sunset shots of the Acropolis. We were introduced to the hill during our guided walk around the general area. There are numerous trails to explore but there are some definite destinations you should know about. The photographers hill is one but more importantly the Pnyx is a part of this hill. I won’t give away the description of the Pnyx here but do look it up because it is one of the most important places for ‘democracy’. Otherwise, just enjoy the hill.",October 2019,Philopappos Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d523835-Reviews-Philopappos_Hill-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
This is such an important place for western culture,"This is one of the best museum experiences you will find anywhere. The building is bright and purposefully built to show the collection of artifacts from the ancient ruin and to teach the visitor about the ancient world. This year the underground excavation area is open as well and on the same ticket. Inside the museum you will progress through time and upward toward the top of the Acropolis and the Parthenon itself seeing close up the great works of sculpture that adorned the structures. Explanatory boards will help you as you progress through the exhibits. You can buy audio guides or have a tour guide as well. Jen and I read the official Acropolis Museum Guide before going and it helped focus our visit. We also made the trek up to the top of the Acropolis before experiencing the museum. I think you can do it either way, museum before going to the Acropolis or the other way, as we did. The point is, take your time and absorb both as much as you can. This is such an important place for western culture.",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worth giving it a try,"Social media has pointed a spotlight on this old traditional restaurant and comments vary from fabulous praise to disdain. We went around noon and found a table easily. As described by many we were served automatically the same dishes as others, chick peas, grilled fish and a vegetable stew. Bread and wine come with this as well. We enjoyed the food and the ambience but I won’t say it was the best local cuisine we have eaten in Athens. It cost a standard 22 euros. Still, it is a unique experience and worth doing if you are looking for this kind of place. We did see other tourists and some locals and one couple that walked in one door, looked around and walked out the other door.",October 2019,Diporto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1198294-Reviews-Diporto-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Around the corner from the museum you will find a good place to eat,"The menu is written on a board outside and that’s what is available on that night. So we ordered beef kokkinisto, a savoury beef brisket slow cooked in a brown cinnamon flavoured sauce and stuffed zucchini, a full length zucchini with a mix of sausage meat wrapped in rice inside the hollowed zucchini. These are dishes made with love. The flavours are complex and satisfying. I notice the name of one of our favourite travel writers on the menu board endorsing this simple restaurant. I finish my plate (of course we shared bites) and I order a plate of peas with potato and carrots. The dish has a unique taste and reddish-orange colour. I ask our server and she says the flavour comes from a herb like anise and the colour is from tomatoes and carrot but not enough to make it tomato flavoured. We leave satisfied",October 2019,To Kati Allo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2108580-Reviews-To_Kati_Allo-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Go early and sit down on a bench for a while,"The crowds are a part of the experience but that’s OK. You can stop in front of every temple or pile of stones and do a selfie if you want but is that why you came? You can stand in front of the information board and read the description for sure but don’t forget to spend just as much time reading the stones that the board is talking about. If you come with one of those tour guides know that they are qualified to tell you something worth hearing so listen and pay attention but look at the stones and not at the guide. By now you must get my message. You are in a sacred place. Just because it’s old and ruined doesn’t diminish this. Respect the place and the people that are there like you, trying to understand the enormity of this place and time. Walk slowly. The stones are slippery.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
No matter what else you do - eat here,"Avli has been written up in a number of zines and blogs so it’s no longer a secret and that means lineups to get a table. So go early. We checked in on our way to the market just around the corner and it was empty. By the time we went back it was half full. Now, imagine an alley, long and narrow, tidy it up and paint it in the national colours, white walls and blue trim. Flagstone floors underfoot and a really old rundown wooden balcony overhead if you look up. Others call this a courtyard but it’s an alley.

In this setting you will find small round blue bistro tables with four chairs each but the orderliness breaks down with more and more hungry customers arriving to eat at the renowned restaurant. We order keftedakia (meatballs) and a pokilia (assortment) of mezes. The bread and wine we order to accompany the meal are simple but perfect and the old fashioned music in the background completes the scene. No wonder there’s a lineup when people don’t want to leave. We watched more than one table continue to order one more plate and a beer just to stay and soak up this place and time",October 2019,Avli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d8747072-Reviews-Avli-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Another small restaurant you to try,"Another small restaurant you have to try. Opos Palia is a bit off the busy tourist route but not far away so definitely worth seeking out. It’s not fancy but it is busy and that is always a signal isn’t it. We wanted to eat the meatballs but they had sold out so we had sardines. What a good choice. They were grilled and salted and crunchy. Just lovely. A squeeze of lemon and they were delicious. We accompanied them with beetroot and a tarama that went down well. A half carafe of the very drinkable house white wine and some bread and we had a great meal.

Sardines, beetroot and tarama",October 2019,Opos palia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4195130-Reviews-Opos_palia-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
An out-of-the-way gem,"We ate here twice in our three-night stay in Nafplio. The tavern was convenient to get to from our apartment and is on a main road so it’s easy to find. The wait staff will tell you about the evening specials and likely show you one a fresh fish that is available. We were tempted but the fish was too large for two people. So, we opted for moussaka and calamari the first night. The moussaka is made without the creamy rich béchemel on top. Instead they use a yogurt topping, likely mixed with egg and cheese baked on top. Delicious and less fattening. I must try this at home. We also ordered two dishes the second night that were new to us, Horta and the Fava bean dish that seems to be on every menu. Horta is a mix of ‘wild greens’, probably arugula and spinach and I think pan fried with garlic. The Fava beans come as a thick porridge consistency with some green onion topping and a red sauce likely for visual contrast. The flavour is similar to pea soup but more intense. We loved it especially with the dry toast that accompanied our meal.

Although this tavern is a little way out of the touristy old-town it is well worth the effort to visit",October 2019,Pidalio Mezedopoleio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g319780-d7362948-Reviews-Pidalio_Mezedopoleio-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Listen and Look,"The ancient theatre is a highlight on the tourist circuit, famed for it’s acoustics. You will see bus tour groups enter and depending on the guide, perform a variety of ways to test the sound. You can ignore them and wait until they leave or you can enjoy the antics. Either way be sure to climb up to whatever height you are comfortable with and listen. Also, look beyond the theatre stage at the backdrop of mountains and trees. Epidavros was a healing centre in the ancient world and attracted the ill from far and wide. Look up Asclepius to learn more.

The easiest way to get to Epidavros from Nafplio is by public bus. The KTEL bus terminal is on Andrea Siggrou street, across from the park with the statue of Kolokotronis. The ticket price is €3.20 per person one way. You buy your return ticket from the driver at Epidavros when you want to return.",October 2019,The Great Theatre of Epidaurus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g815573-d198893-Reviews-The_Great_Theatre_of_Epidaurus-Epidavros_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Epidavros, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Cooking in a great kitchen,"When we visit another city and culture we must eat the food that is there, but to go deeper into the culture why not learn to make the food you eat? This AirB&B Experience is the one we chose for our visit to Athens. The location of the teaching kitchen is perfect. You are beside the central market of Athens. A huge complex of shopping streets around the historic market itself provides the visitor with lots of ’food for the eye’. But we are here for the stomach too so the market shopping will get us started. Our chef-guide was Malpo and she led our small group through the streets and shops expertly pointing out some interesting details as we went.

Once our ingredients were bought we returned to the beautiful space where we would cook.
Malpo and Mariefi, who sous-cheffed this day, make you feel at ease and get you acquainted with the other guests before starting. Everyone gets an apron and a station at the teaching island and the class begins with chopping. We are making a Greek Salad. Then we prepare the ingredients we bought for the moussaka. This is the centrepiece of the meal and must be done carefully. Next, the cheese pies made with a philo pastry that is so easy you will wonder why you didn’t try it before. A little glass of ouzo and ‘yamas’ and we are off to a good start. Later some raki appears and we talk a little louder.

Eventually our meal is ready and we find a place at the table. A nice glass of white wine pairs with our food and we all enjoy our work in a Greek kitchen.

If you haven’t tried a cooking class experience before while traveling this would be a good start. Thank you Malpo and Mariefi for a delicious experience.",October 2019,Onion Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12529075-Reviews-Onion_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
A Student lunch,"In the middle of the day there is a line in front of Eidessaïkó, a small inexpensive restaurant on Agiou Demitriou. The food is on display in chafing dishes in the window and is continually being replenished by the cooks. I had read that a meal cost only 3 euros. Then on a Saturday night after a full day Jen and I were hungry and decided to go to Eidessaïkó. It is just around the corner from the apartment and we were curious to see what it was like. The energetic waiter greeted us in English and dished out huge portions of our choices. The ’mains’ are priced at a flat fee of 3 euros and he adds whatever else you want from a selection of rice or pasta done in a variety of ways. I had a lasagna main and Jen had the kebabs. You get two kebabs. We shared our mains and left stuffed. What a great food service for the many young students who come to Thessaloniki to study at the university",October 2019,Edessaiko,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189473-d15051761-Reviews-Edessaiko-Thessaloniki_Thessaloniki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,"Thessaloniki, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
More than a’cozy’ place,We ate at Nostos twice in our five-night visit to Thessaloniki. The restaurant staff are warm and welcoming and helped us select from the menu so we ate what we wanted. The menu is top notch with fresh ingredients and loving preparation. The first night I had some small fish breaded and fried and delicious. Greek potatoes and a salad and you are done. The next visit we ordered a lamb shank prepared in a brown sweet sauce with meat falling off the bone. So good! We sat outside for both meals and enjoyed the ambience of this neighbourhood.

Free But Invaluable,"We planned to do this walking tour very early in our week-long stay in Athens as a way to get oriented to the Acropolis. What a great tour it turned out to be. Our guide, George, was very well informed and the route chosen was perfect for us. We met up, easily finding our group from the directions given, and started out. The tour goes away from the busy tourist area and you soon find yourself gazing at sites you wouldn’t have thought to explore. George combined explanations of mythology, history, archaeology, and modern culture in ways that helped us understand the importance of the ancient Greeks. When the tour concludes back at the starting point you will be ready to venture out on your own.

In preparation for a visit to Pella,"I planned to visit Pella and Vergina but wanted more context so that I could better understand this amazing part of the world. The Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki is just the place to get that information. The exhibit starts with a great little explanatory section called Towards The Birth Of Cities.

The organization of the exhibits takes the visitor through the prehistory and the period of the Macedonian kingdom and Alexander The Great to the Roman period.

It’s conveniently located near to the Monastiraki metro station and it is a good sized restaurant so getting a table without reservations is easy. We came for the gyros on the recommendation of a local. You won’t be disappointed with this.

Moúrga is mainly a seafood restaurant,"Moúrga is mainly a seafood restaurant and serves only what is fresh in the market. The description on Google calls it ‘cosy’ which I guess means’not fancy’. However, the food is superb in it’s preparation and presentation. The service is excellent as well. Our waiter not only spoke excellent English but also made suggestions to help us choose our meal. The dishes are meant to be shared, as is common in Greece. We went on a Thursday evening around eight and it was not busy but it can get crowded later.

Character and good food,"You know when you walk in the door and see three or four tables with people eating dinner that this will be good. It's a pub, so there's a bar with a few locals but the sound isn't blasting and you can find a place to sit. We had a big group, nine hikers in all, and we were hungry. We ordered drinks and dinners and of course all on separate bills. But the server handled us well, even played along with our 'out of town' airs, giving us a taste of local attitude. It was ok, even amusing and she got it. I'd go back. Oh, and the food? I had the special, a hearty meaty soup (home-made hamburger soup) and grilled cheese and ham sandwich.
