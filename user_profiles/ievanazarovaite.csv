A lot of good memories,"The best place to get souvenirs because of its good price and large assortiment. Nice arcitecture as well. If you plan to visit Plaka, visit Anafiotika as well, because it is near, we really recommend it! If you like to walk around tight streets, you would love it.",April 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
One of the cosiest place in the world,"As we were walking around Acropolis, we didn't want to leave. We even walked around Acropolis again and again. We felt like home, even if there were a lot of people with us. And we had a really nice surprise that the entrance for european students is free",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
