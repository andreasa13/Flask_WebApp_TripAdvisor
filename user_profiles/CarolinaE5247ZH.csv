Mmmmmm GOOD,"I've been going a very long time, and I look forward to it each time. The ice cream is fresh and tasty.

Hope They Get It Together,"I've been going to this restaurant to support them when they were closed when they offered only take out. I figured I would support their business.
Food is so so. It is about average. Mostly people mull around on the lot with drinks.
Find now when you order they are very forgetful. One time they forgot the drinks. Another time no fries that came with the order. When I call and tell them, they don't apologize and say to come all the way back, but they do it again every time. They forget the condiments such as, mustard, relish or ketchup that goes with the order. Told Oh, he is new. No, he isn't. One time the same guy when the doors were open told me when I called that we had to wait and call back because they were not ready with their setup But, I was in their parking lot and other people were being waited on while I had to wait.
At times attitude is in check, also. I do like going there. It is a very pretty place, but I just wish they would be a little more careful about how they treat customers.",October 2020,Barnacle Bills,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46794-d4041300-Reviews-Barnacle_Bills-Rumson_New_Jersey.html,"Rumson, New Jersey",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Life Changing,"This is a place I wanted to visit my entire life, and I finally did in
2016, and at that time, they were restoring the ancient buildings. Once on top, it is difficult to walk. There is a paved walkway and disabled can use a lift on side of mountain but must be in a wheelchair to do so. Awesome and

Not so Pleasant,"Been going a long time to this diner. Lately the cashier can be very rude and unpleasant along with a couple of waitresses. I don't understand their attitude, especially when you go in to relax and dine and pay good money. A couple of these people tend to not give good customer service to women, especially the cashier.

Miss the Pot Roast,"I have been going there for years. I went last year also besides this past February, and I was told no pot roast. That has always been a favorite of my family. I'm told it takes too long. It was a very good dish. It showed they had it on the menu when I looked in Feb , and I went there for lunch for that reason. Told, ""no we don't have that any more."" Then why is it always on the menu? The atmosphere is very nice.
Well, if you can't get the pot roast and told other things on the menu they didn't have when I tried to substitute, I can't waste my time.

Sunset Beach Beautiful,"I live in Central NJ and often go to Cape May. Sunset Beach is a beautiful area. There are unique gift shops which are fun. Also, there is a free parking lot right there near the beach. The smaller lot gets full but the free parking is accessible to everyone and has ample parking. Everyone has different taste, but I love it there. There are many people that go, but to me that is part of the fun.

A Beautiful Sight,I never thought I would visit such a wonderful place and have this experience. Clear waters rushed from the fountain but what I noticed besides the great work of art were the birds that sat upon it that only made it more natural and lovely and all the people gathered around it. All the while seeing this listening to Ave Maria played over the crowd of people. It is located in a piazza with a clock tower which is animated and beautiful and an old church with paintings and sculptures. All together it was perfect.

I love the environment of it. No desert and no coffee served. Kind of miss that part of it. Otherwise, it is a great place to eat.

Pandora is Magical,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but it turned out to be really a beautiful place. Best time to go is at night to see the luminous lights which are all colors in the plants, waterfalls and high rocky cliffs.
If you want to take the Pandora ride, get there early as it is a very, very long wait. You can always come back at night. Same for the boat ride at night...very long wait. This is in Animal Kingdom so when you enter the park you see the Tree of Life which I never get tired seeing. As we were leaving the park, the tree of life was all lit up in fantastic colors and in the center of the tree trunk there were scenes from the Lion King. Really great! Be prepared for lots of walking. If someone has trouble with the walking, a small scooter can be rented to zip around with. These scooters are available when you call Disney. But lots of people and strollers to contend with.
Outside rental company for the scooter is suggested by Disney which comes apart and can fit in a car. Little heavy. Easy to assemble and worth it. Better to have the smaller one like this one. Renting a scooter from Universal is large and combersome and more expensive and hard to handle. .",January 2018,Pandora – The World of Avatar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d12875121-Reviews-Pandora_The_World_of_Avatar-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Place for Fun,"I wanted to see the Harry Potter exhibit which I did. I loved it. Universal and Island of Adventure. Fun to walk through Diagon Alley with its shops and pubs. It's hidden from the main part. Looked like London, England with its cobblestone streets.
Waited from the dragon before we entered the alley to spit fire. It was great. Kids can interact with their wands in the store front windows. I liked the money exchange exhibit and the candy and chocolate stores. Lots of walking. The scooters people use there are very large and heavy and hard to move around. Better to rent on the outside that Disney recommends.
I wasn't too happy with the Hogwart's Train Station. Train looks nice but they cram people in separate cars which are uncomfortable. They close the door and show a film on the window. Glad when it was over. You have to pay for two parks if you take the train. Not necessary to take the train you can easily walk to the other park.

NJ to Rome,Seating was cramped. The flight attendants did their job and kept water and hot and cold drinks coming. They were as helpful as they could be. Food was fair but not much choice. Noticed all the window shades on this very tight plane were pulled down. No light at all came in. Only thing that saved us on this very long flight was a small movie screen we were facing. Somehow we got the middle seats. Wouldn't suggest opting for those seats. Very uncomfortable. We had a little turbulence over Halifax but the pilots handled that well. Flying over the ocean seemed to be a breeze. Didn't bother me. I have to give the flight crew an A+. I found out later I could have upgraded to better seating if I had asked since we are frequent flyers. Next time I'll do that and get better seats. They did help me since I had some trouble with my knee on this flight and made certain I didn't have to wait in a big line at customs and had a shuttle bring me right there.

Standing there in the courtyard with the music of Ave Maria playing everyone became silent and in the moment. There is a beautiful church a few feet from the clock which we toured....beautiful architecture.....paintings, statues worth seeing. You can go into the church and sit and rest.

Happy Mother's Day for Everyone Not Only a Few.,"This is my third trip on the Whale Watcher. Today, Mother's Day, was a beautiful day and I was treated out by my daughter like everyone else with family there. The crew was courteous and informative and kept a watchful eye out for the passengers on board. Smooth ride and safe. Crew wished the mothers a Happy Mother's Day. It was very nice. Saw plenty of dolphins and the water was calm and just wonderful. At the end of the tour when visited the gift shop that the Captain suggested and said it was his. Lovely place. One problem of all days for people to get nasty this was not a good day. First don't treat customers rudely, especially when they are spending good money. Big line of people that she treated nicely but ""why me and my daughter."" I didn't need someone with a bad attitude wrecking my day. Daughter was paying for items we picked out about $68.00 worth and this women at the register deliberately made a scene out of my daughter;s Gold Card.Mind you we just bought tickets for the boat ride - no problem. I don't know if this women ever saw one before but made a big scene looking at the signature at the back of the card to see if it was hers even though my daughter hadn't signed the receipt yet. I asked the cost of another item and without looking she said $80 and would not talk to me when I spoke. My daughter asked if I wanted it, but I gladly said no. This women was just out to be rude and above board discourteous. Well, what a way to end a beautiful day. This women has to learn in dealing with the public with a smile not a snarl and that people pay with good hard earned money and that money pays for their paychecks.
To this women. Heads up that some women do in this day and age make a great living. The shame of it was she didn't do it to anyone else in line that she took a credit card from.

They have a large dining area and the food is good. One thing I would advise is to have a car to get around in. Not many shops or stores close by the inn as it is set in away from the main road.

He was the perfect guide for us. We stopped to taste wine and sample some of the food which was grand. Had a cup of coffee overlooking a beautiful landscape. It was very pleasant. Would recommend this tour. To get here first you have to take a cable car and what views you will see. Grand views. Then the rest is up to you.

He was on time and we had a comfortable ride. It was fun on the cart being right on the streets with the people. He grew up in Rome and knew the best of it. We went down the back streets and got to see the culture close up. He really extended himself for us.
Brought us to a beautiful restaurant where we had wine and good food. Wish I was there now. I would recommend this tour 100%.
I have some trouble walking and he took great care to see that I was comfortable and able to see everything.

A Site to Behold,"My family was looking forward to seeing the Trevi Fountain.
It was very crowded but we were able to get right down by it and admire it up close.
There may be certain times of the year that it is less crowded.
Seeing this place made one of my dream come true. Didn't see any coins in the fountain so I didn't throw one in but still made a wish.

Wonderful Wonderful Tour with Markos,"Santorini Experts tour for us turned out to be a highlight of our vacation with our guide Markos. I had some difficulty walking but he made this tour easy with his patience and kind mannerism.
I can't say enough about him. He took us high up on the mountain and the winding roads overlooking some of the most beautiful views in the world.
We really clicked with him, and it was a fun tour. He is a very knowledgeable person and taught us many things about the people and the culture.

Walking along the marble way and seeing the awesome views was a dream come true for my daughter, Heather, and myself. Never saw anything so beautiful. I'm glad he was the one to show us the grandeur of this special island.
Looking at the photos, I know one day we will visit again as the blue clear waters and vistas are so inviting. We stopped and visited Maria for the wine tasting and brought some honey and olive oil home that is simply the best. Maria is a gem and we tasted some really fine wine.
Thank you Markos for being a superman for us and making us brave going around those high twist and turns. We had great confidence in you. Very cool! Remember!

Hope to see you again. God Bless you and your family.

Not Like It Use To Be,"I'm a long time resident of Clifton. Needless to say, I have patronized this restaurant most of my life and my children have also.
Recently revisited and saw that the original owner sold the place. It had been renovated and looked very nice. Couldn't wait to go in.
Not so. Service was awkward and unpleasant. Waited very long for service with nobody in the place. Waiter didn't take our order right a way and we were patient. He keyed on one table.
When he finally did come , he said we couldn't get what was on the menu and conveniently didn't even ask or write it down. Come on, french fries at lunch time. Then served us and things were missing. Then he said he didn't order it for us because the cooks didn't want to serve it.. But didn't say that before we ordered.

To top it the unpleasant reality of having one of the long old time waitresses there who deliberately ignored us and was rude to us. She worked there for 40 years or so and was always rude. After all this time? Never would take our table. I guess some things never change.

We still went back and ordered out, she walked over to us snickered and wouldn't wait on us. When we ordered they said we could get one thing which was a milder sauce, and when we arrived to pick it up, they said sorry no they didn't have cocktail sauce, but they serve shrimp. If we knew it, we couldn't have purchased it. Don't they know people can't eat certain things.

Food was not good and not served well. Waiter never even asked if the food was all right on our first visit. I don't think they care at all about customers. I won't go there again. Their old time waitress needs a talking to by the owner.",September 2016,Mario's Restaurant & Pizzeria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46365-d4946697-Reviews-Mario_s_Restaurant_Pizzeria-Clifton_New_Jersey.html,"Clifton, New Jersey",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Try Somewhere Else,"Went to an event in the Catskills and was referred to this diner for lunch. Loud and noisy which isn't so bad sometimes but this was overkill. We were seated at the counter and were served our drinks and the hostess came up to us and asked if we had been seated there. She saw we had been served cold drinks. They had called us when we were waiting outside and seated us. They sat us at the counter.
The manager kept standing in front of us behind the counter and was very unwelcoming and rude. He kept sneering at us. They should get their act together.
The waitress was very nice but the food was horrible. One hamburger with cheddar cheese. The meat was good but served on a roll that you could crack your teeth on.
Wound up just eating the beef.
The other meal was pancakes. The pancakes were puffed up with baking powder but not tender and hard on the outside. Prices too high for this place. Played loud 50s music on and off. Not good for everyone.",August 2016,Phoenicia Diner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48391-d672182-Reviews-Phoenicia_Diner-Phoenicia_Catskill_Region_New_York.html,"Phoenicia, New York",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Lots of Family Fun,"Staff was very helpful. Good for families with children and adults. You can sit back and relax on this ride. Spacious seating and the windows open. Could go longer than 45 mins. They stop at a 100 year old train museum.
You can stand or sit outside in the open car, which is great for getting fresh air. They have two places that they operate. One in Kingston and the other in Shokan, NY. Hard to get them on the phone. You have to make sure you are at the right place. We went to Kingston and the train was not operating there, but we were lucky to get someone to answer the phone and got directions to Shokan. If they hadn't answered the phone, we would never had known where to go.

Claridge Hotel a Classy Place,"After a long drive, we arrived at the Claridge Hotel. I found it the best choice for my family. We were greeted by a pleasant and courteous valet service. The entrance of the hotel is right there with easy check in. The desk clerk was accommodating and friendly on check-in, Brenda, the Front Desk Agent saw to it that we were taken care of after our long drive. She pointed out the dining area for us and quickly gave us our room even though we were a little early. The food in the Dining Room was excellent and so was the service. We had breakfast served up in the room which was excellent. Lots of food at a good price. Beautiful place to have a wonderful dining experience. I found the prices to be very reasonable. I loved the entire history of the hotel, and its beautiful lobby when you first walk in.
Our room had a spectacular view of the AC hotels and the shore line. I can't say enough good things about it, except we will be back for certain.
There is a question here: Is this a romantic hotel? They have an art gallery. For me it was about family. For others, it could be very romantic. It is a classy hotel but casual and comfortable.

Landmark Restaurant near to Atlantic City,"This was a very comfortable and accessible restaurant and the staff treated everyone well. If you are in Atlantic City, it is only a short way over the bridge to Somers Point. The food is excellent and fresh. The seafood was out of this world. We sat in a nice dining room with our friends. Went back again the next day and had a late lunch on the outside porch, and the service was quick, and again, another great dining experience. The ambieance was lovely and tavern style, and I liked it being directly across the street from the water.

They get crowded for lunch but every one I saw was treated with courtesy. You can't have it perfect every time I'm sure by the sound of other comments, but I expect to go again when I'm down in that area. The food is delicious.

Restaurant isn't about Customers,"Wish the owner would pay more attention to what is going on with their staff as they once had a nice restaurant to enjoy. They do have a problem with staff gossiping and talking with patrons too much and getting overly familiar. Their long time hostess can be very very rude and insulting and no one knows the better for it which influences the other staff members. They don't change anything at all to improve. I give them good tips and still get the rudeness.

They don't have much of a variety of dishes to choose from for a restaurant that has been operating so long. They make a good burger and steak at times, but not many choices of anything else. You can get what they serve anywhere. They use to make a good effort to please customers, but it is more about staff ruling the roost at this point. It's too bad.",November 2014,The Lafayette House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46546-d645700-Reviews-The_Lafayette_House-Lafayette_New_Jersey.html,"Lafayette, New Jersey",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Best Western - North Gate to Yellow Stone Park,"This was the best accommodations to stay which was a mile or less away from the North Gate of Yellow Stone Park. I decided on this hotel after flying in and driving from Bozeman Airport which was about 1 1/2 hours away from the Best Western in Gardiner so that we could get an early start in the morning. I pulled my car right up to the door of the room. The room was very clean had two very comfortable queen beds, tv, portable refrigerator,coffee maker, microwave, good size bath area. I chose a room on the banks and above the Yellow Stone River rapids where I got a great view. You can imagine what that was like. Awesome!
The Best Western gives you a 10% discount in the gift store next to the restaurant up on the driveway entrance. Great gifts. Plus, you get a free all you can eat buffet breakfast in the morning.
It is in the small western town of Gardiner which is very quaint cowboy town, and they have river rafting at Montana flying pigs river rafting which my daughter did. Yes, that's the name. She loved it. Right next to it they have zip lining company, but you have to wait 3 hours for everyone else to finish to get a drive back to your car. Lots to do.

After breakfast we drove through the Roosevelt Arch at the north entrance to Yellowstone in Gardiner, Mt. If you have a pass to get in, usually seniors National Park Pass, you save yourself $25.00. You drive about 2 miles up through the Yellow Stone Ranger gate to the Mamouth Hot Springs. Even after the ranger park gate we started seeing wild life.

This hotel is within a very, very small quaint town that has gift shops, small restaurants, and general stores, and other lodging.",July 2014,"The Ridgeline Hotel At Yellowstone, Ascend Hotel Collection",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45184-d91212-Reviews-The_Ridgeline_Hotel_At_Yellowstone_Ascend_Hotel_Collection-Gardiner_Montana.html,"Gardiner, Montana",hotels,5.0,3.5
Wonderful Experience,"Old Faithful Inn is a perfect place for my family and myself for a starting point to tour Yellow Stone Park. Very rustic and homey and the sun filtered through the lobby early in the morning where people would meet and talk in a friendly atmosphere. Hotel staff were all pleasant and helpful. There was a good hot refreshing shower in the room and small sink, no tub, but didn't matter. Hospitality staff was always there to be helpful. Reservations must be made at least a year or more in advance in order to guarantee a room. We were lucky enough to get a room directly facing the geyser and every night we saw the geyser blow. It goes off every hour and ninety minutes more or less. How lucky were we! The room we had allowed us to walk right outside down a small wild flowe and pine tree path directly to the geyser any time of day or night. The Inn is very quaint and very beautiful made of lodgepole pine inside and out, so it is esthetically pleasing. We had some thunder and lightening outside which added to the charm of the warmth of the Inn.
As far as the main dining room menu, it isn't for everyone. Somewhat over the top and not too many choices and not very good. Not much of anything for kids to eat. They have a kids menu but the food isn't what they would expect. Macaroni and cheese for kids but the kids complained that there was no cheese in it.
Bear Paw Restaurant which was adjacent to the dining room didn't have too much except some burgers and bison burgers, chicken wings, etc. Very limited. They also have a deli which I would have to say didn't have very much and was expensive. They had pre wrapped sandwiches which weren't too appetizing.
For breakfast in the dining room, mushy oatmeal, soggy french toast, blueberry pancakes with non thawed ice cold berries on top. For such a beautiful well-known place, I think they should review their menu or watch their cooking staff carefully. Their snack bar in the lobby did serve big ice cream cones and sundaes which were pretty delicious. Thumbs up on that.
Food seems to be a problem in that area of the park. The Old Faithful Snow Lodge adjacent to the Inn had the same menu as the Inn although it showed much more on the menu.
All in all I loved the Inn and will go back again. We walked up to the geyser around 5:30 a.m. in the morning and were lucky to be there while a photographer from National Geographic was waiting for Old Faithful to blow to take pictures for the magazine. You never know what to expect. All fun! If you want to get close to nature, this is the place.

Tours from the hotel were great. Saw plenty of wild life roaming around, bison (buffalo), moose, elk, bear near by the road or in the distance. Twilight tour or yellow bus tour both great.",July 2014,Old Faithful Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60999-d220121-Reviews-Old_Faithful_Inn-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming",hotels,5.0,4.0
Beautiful Church Worth Seeing But Beware,"The architecture of the church is beautiful and very old. It is very large and if you enter on the bottom level you can hear a recording of monks voices chanting. It has an awesome sound.
The staircase that goes up to the top of the church is very narrow and winding and there are many many steps. When there is two-way traffic it is hard to get around. You feel closed in. Small window openings going up. Not many.

It is very crowded. Be sure to have transportation to the Market and back as it is almost impossible to catch a taxi cab. I waited for one and as I opened the door to get in, a group of people stole my ride. It is a little rough for the average tourist. Wound up searching for a subway that we had to descend down the hill with 100s of steps for a long ways. Locals aren't willing to give directions or be helpful. Finally found the subway after a 2 hour search and more stairs to challenge. Not for the faint of heart.
Once I got back near to my hotel, you couldn't catch a taxi on the street. They don't stop.
They line up on one street and the one in the very front will get the fare. The problem is getting one.
All in all Paris is beautiful and the church worth seeing but dangerous for the tourist. You do have to watch out for beggars and thieves. Even at the Eifel Tower you will find beggars and people out to pick your pocket you or be very forceful wanting money. Another thing, if it rains and you are on top of the tower, they close down the lift. You are stuck up there for as long as it rains.

No parking on the streets so you can't rent a car. They do have bus tours through the City that the the tourist will get free. You have to contact them or wind up paying for tours that aren't very good. If you can't keep up with the walking tours, they will leave you behind. I found some of the shop keepers very unfriendly and rude. Didn't find many good restaurants.",July 2013,Basilique du Sacre-Coeur de Montmartre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d190685-Reviews-Basilique_du_Sacre_Coeur_de_Montmartre-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Not as Expected,"Went out to eat and heard good things about this restaurant which is attached to the Madison Inn.
The Tavern opened at 4:00 p.m., and we arrived there about 4:15.

Since they are a steakhouse and I heard good things, I looked forward to their prime rib. It was featured on the menu, but the waiter said that it would not be ready until 5:30. I was disappointed because it was on the menu and I came a long way. Then he said I'll check, and when he came back, he said it was ready then. We placed our order and sat and sat and sat waiting. Everyone else was served who came in later. About 5:10 we were told that the prime rib was done but we still had to wait for the dinner and they apologized. We were very patient. They didn't even put bread on the table.

At 5:30 they brought the plates out. One was a hamburger platter. The other was the prime rib which looked as if it were only microwaved quickly. Usually a steakhouse will serve on a sizzling platter which is very hot. Instead this was thrown on the plate looking very unappetizing with no garnishment, not even parsley or green beans. A luke warm dish with a plain steak in the middle of an oversized dish. This steak was $32.00 for a 6 oz steak. They did say they had side dishes which were ala carte so I ordered spinach and mashed potatoes. The two side dishes came separate in big dishes enough for 2 or 3 people. The creamed spinach was good but the potatoes were bland and heavy - not whipped well. I had a plain steak without garnishment and 2 big side orders larger than the steak. The steak was served without any steak sauce and did not have any flavor. I couldn't finish the food as I didn't like it.

I don't think I'll return. The dining room is attractive but somewhat noisy. The waiter wasn't attentive. After they put the food down, they never came back to check to see if everything was okay.",January 2014,GK's Red Dog Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60906-d3608924-Reviews-GK_s_Red_Dog_Tavern-Morristown_Morris_County_New_Jersey.html,"Morristown, New Jersey",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Great Seafood,"I've been dining there for a few years and every time the food is cooked to perfection.
It is located in a small mall and has a store front, which I find very shore friendly and charming.
There is no better place for seafood in Central NJ. I've tried several dishes there, and I like them all. Flounder is difficult to get at restaurants at times, but they serve up a good one whether broiled or fried with rice or potato and vegetables. They have a good size menu. They open at 12:00 p.m. until about 2:00 p.m. and then reopen at 5:00 p.m. until about 8:00 p.m. Very quiet and friendly dining experience. I find it very comfortable and the staff experienced and attentive.
In the front of the store, they sell fresh seafood which has always been very good to take home and cook for yourself. I also go there on holidays. Last year we went on New Year's Eve.

Earlier we had lunch in the Sports Lounge and the food was excellent. They also have a large self service dining area with a variety of hot and cold food which everyone was enjoying.

Not impressed.,"Made reservations for TG dinner which to my surprise late afternoon was called lunch and did not turn out as nice as I expected. The restaurant looks nice enough, but I can't say that the host or hostess have good attitudes. No hospitality training exhibited. This was my first visit, and I was not impressed. We were greeted cordially, but when it was time to seat us, the hostess said in a flippant way, sit them over there along the alcove. I didn't like the word ""them"" used on us.
We saw our waiter very little but other tables were being served and approached consistently. Our first course was served by a woman and quickly taken away before I was finished and salads were put down. Our waiter disappeared. When the woman brought our TG entree, I told her I did not want to rush eating. At that point, they didn't rush us out. The turkey was thick and thrown on top of the stuffing, not presented well. Sweet potatoes were whipped to death without flavor. Stuffing was suppose to be chestnut but was mashed all together. Looked more like mash that you feed farm animals. Not enough bread and butter that they served.
The waiter showed up at the end saying that dessert was in the other room, and we had to go serve ourselves. The desserts were very bad. No traditional pies or cakes. Everything was all stale and mushy looking, which I left uneaten. Did not taste good.
The waiter apparently didn't care about the service as he got 20% gratuity built into the price of dinner. It was obvious he was young and not experienced and when I spoke he cut me off quickly and walked away. He did not know how to treat diners. He didn't deserve 20% of the cost of a $46.00 a plate turkey dinner, plus. The service was bad and the only thing passable was the house salad. It was very disappointing to have this happen on a holiday as one looks forward to enjoying a meal with family and friends. It was very disappointing.",November 2013,The Grain House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46287-d1023230-Reviews-The_Grain_House-Basking_Ridge_New_Jersey.html,"Basking Ridge, New Jersey",restaurants,1.0,4.0
"Kevin, Bus 81- Charmed Summer Tour","We had a great time on a beautiful clear sunny day. On July 4 we took the Red Bus Tour - Going-to-the-Sun Road, and I can't say enough good things about this experience. Our guide, Kevin, Bus 81, was so much fun. He took picked us up at Many Glacier Hotel and took us on a memorable ride into the high mountains with beautiful views.
Kevin was friendly with a pleasant disposition, he told funny jokes and made us laugh, informative, and a very safe driver. I can't say enough about this person because when I look back on the time spent in Many Glacier, this tour was one of the best highlights of the trip. The views were out of this world and I loved the additional splash of cold mountain water when we drove through. I didn't find the ride uncomforable at all as the Red Bus is a classic vehicle, and when you ride in it, you are getting a touch of history.
