Mediocre Hotel,"We stayed one night while on a tour of England, Scotland and Wales. Our room was clean and large but there was no drawer space at all. the bed was rock hard with thin pillows. The closet consisted of two pegs that were mounted to the wall with a few hangers on them. We faced the street and there was tremendous noise all night long from people walking by.

The bathroom was small but efficient.

The breakfast was the weakest breakfast we had on our tour. Not a lot of selections but it was still something to eat for breakfast.

Even though this hotel is located within the city walls, I would have much rather stayed elsewhere.",September 2017,Holiday Inn York City Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186346-d877993-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_York_City_Centre-York_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"York, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0

Loved the Shambles,"It was so fun to walk on The Shambles. Very historic. Had to stop at the ""Shop That Must Not Be Named."" Had to purchase Harry Potter gifts for family. I loved just strolling along.",September 2017,Shambles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186346-d208249-Reviews-Shambles-York_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"York, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great place to stay,"We stayed two nights at the Novotel Edinburgh Centre as part of a group tour. Our room was spacious and I appreciated the small couch to sit on. All too often rooms, just have one chair and it's not always comfortable. I do wish there had been some drawer storage. There were a couple of shelves to the right of the desk and the little closet area had shelves as well. The safe and refrigerator were much appreciated and used.

I loved the bathroom! Toilet by itself in a small room and a separate bathroom with a separate tub and shower along with the sink. This made it very convenient for obvious reasons.

The location was great. Only a 20 minute walk to the Royal Mile.

Breakfast was good. Not as many selections as our hotel in London, but still quite nice. I certainly didn't go hungry.

All in all, a wonderful place to stay. I would definitely stay here again!",September 2017,Novotel Edinburgh Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186525-d289742-Reviews-Novotel_Edinburgh_Centre-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0

Impressive,We toured the Palace of Holyrood House as part of a group tour. I so enjoyed the tour. It was interesting to imagine the Royal Family eating in the dining room. The place settings of course were beautiful! I loved the facts and pictures of the royal families through the years. Also was interesting learning about Mary Queen of Scots.,September 2017,Palace of Holyroodhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d213542-Reviews-Palace_of_Holyroodhouse-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Abbey in Ruins,"At the end of our tour of the Palace of Holyrood house, you could see the Abbey as you were exiting. Even though it is in ruins, There was a special holy feeling on the grounds. I can only imagine how beautiful it must have been in its heyday. Maybe not that large, but still beautiful.",September 2017,Holyrood Abbey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186525-d1544252-Reviews-Holyrood_Abbey-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
A Royal Stay,"We stayed at the Ruthin Castle for one night as part of a group tour. I wish we could have stayed another night. We didn't arrive until late and had virtually no time to explore the grounds. I loved the peacocks roaming around and the Lion statues greeting us as we arrived.

We were fortunate to pay and upgrade to a Junior Suite. It was heavenly having a sitting room in addition to our bedroom. Again, it would have been nice to have more time in the room. Our view looked out on a lovely garden.

Our bathroom was lovely. Since the shower was included in a clawfoot bathtub, I had to be extremely careful not to slip. It was a climb to go over the side of the tub for the shower.

Breakfast was very good. Had a table by the window that looked out onto a lovely garden, A very peaceful start tot he day.

The hotel: I was surprised there weren't more elegant touches. The room we had our dinner in had bare well-worn floors with no rugs and the large display cabinet that was alongside the wall had nothing displayed in it. I even saw a few spider webs that I don't think were there for decoration. The next morning I walked by the room and the floor had a red carpet runner going down the center with chairs on each side. I would imagine it was set up for a wedding. A very stark room for a wedding or dinner for that matter. I've stayed in other castles and you always see a coat of arms and fabulous paintings on the walls. I didn't see that much. Maybe they weren't in the main rooms. There is, of course, the haunted painting. That was fun to look at.

I would definitely stay here again, I hope it continues to be upgraded.",September 2017,Ruthin Castle Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g552035-d590002-Reviews-Ruthin_Castle_Hotel-Ruthin_Denbighshire_North_Wales_Wales.html,"Ruthin, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
Great location,"We stayed at the Mercure Shakespeare Hotel for two nights at the end of a British tour. The hotel is old, so you need to accept that the rooms may not be that great. Our room was extremely small and didn't have a view, but the location of the hotel is wonderful! You're in the center and you can walk anywhere in town.

Our breakfast was good. You could request your eggs cooked to order. I found plenty to eat.

All in all, a very pleasant stay.",September 2017,Mercure Stratford-Upon-Avon Shakespeare Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186399-d210368-Reviews-Mercure_Stratford_Upon_Avon_Shakespeare_Hotel-Stratford_upon_Avon_Warwickshire_England.html,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Very enjoyable,"Loved touring the family home and hearing the docents describe the rooms. Enjoyed the actors in the courtyard performing mini Shakespeare plays. If you need to use the bathroom facilities, make sure to do so before you exit into the gift shop. Our friends didn't realize those were the only bathrooms. Once they exited into the gift shop, they wouldn't allow them to go back out to use the bathrooms. I thought that wasn't very nice. They could see they came in from the birthplace and you had to pay to enter.",September 2017,Shakespeare's Birthplace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186399-d213854-Reviews-Shakespeare_s_Birthplace-Stratford_upon_Avon_Warwickshire_England.html,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Charming cruise,Went on the cruise as part of a group tour. It was a lovely experience. I enjoyed the headset that highlighted the sights you were seeing.

Good tour and dinner,"We toured Hall's Croft and had our farewell dinner as part of a group tour of England. The house was quite large and very interesting to hear about how the good Doctor arrived at his patients' diagnosis.

Delicious Fish n Chip,"Ate lunch here and enjoyed it very much. You can either order take away or dine in. Not very many tables but worth the short wait. Loved that I could order a Senior Fish n Chips. It was only one filet and just the perfect amount.

We had a great time. Would come back. About a 5 minute walk from The Shambles.",September 2017,Drakes Fisheries,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186346-d1955313-Reviews-Drakes_Fisheries-York_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"York, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great pub lunch,My husband and I wanted a good lunch after visiting Churchill's War Rooms. The Red Lion was highly recommended. We went and the first 2 floors were extremely full and busy. We walked up to the 3rd floor and they had room. We had a delicious fish n chips lunch in a very cozy room with a small bar; perfect for our lunch. The food was delivered by a dumb waiter possibly from the ground floor kitchen. Service was excellent! Hopefully the next time we're in London we can come back. It would be worth it.,September 2017,The Red Lion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d3407421-Reviews-The_Red_Lion-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Delicious High Tea,"Ending a tour in Stratford-Upon-Avon We were supposed to go to Stonehenge on our last day. When we couldn't go due to transportation issues, our hotel recommended visiting Broadway, which was a short ride of about 20-25 minutes by taxi . Our small group found Tisanes and decided it was just the spot to have High Tea which we hadn't had on our tour of England. I'm so glad we waited...... It was delicious! The sandwiches were fresh and tasty. The tea was wonderful and the cakes! Of my goodness, they were amazing. We had the best service outside in the lovely garden. The weather cooperated and had a lovely time. To cap it off, our server even arranged transportation back to our hotel for us. We had a lovely day.

They also had a large selection of teas for purchase.

I highly recommend Tisanes and look forward to coming back.",September 2017,Tisanes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186421-d2458459-Reviews-Tisanes-Broadway_Cotswolds_England.html,"Broadway, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great for families,"Our family of 11 recently stayed at Staybridge Suites Anaheim At The Park. we were in town for a wedding and a day at Disneyland. We reserved two 2 bedroom suites and one studio suite for my husband and I. The 2 bedroom suites worked perfectly for our two children and their young families. Our studio suite was very spacious and suited our needs just fine. The hotel opened in April of this year so it's in great condition. The sofas weren't the most comfortable. Maybe they need breaking in!

Breakfast was good. There is fruit, muffins and bagels, oatmeal, cereal, sliced cheese, scrambled eggs and a meat side. You can also make your own waffles, As you can tell, plenty of food and the staff couldn't have been nicer! They kept everything filled and the tables cleaned off. I felt so guilty because we had a couple of toddlers that made the table and floor area look like a bomb had gone off. I offered to sweep the floor, but the staff laughed and said they were happy to take care of the mess.

The front desk staff were so nice. Kevan and Liliana were a delight to deal with. Very pleasant and did whatever they could with a smile on their face. We checked in early and although our rooms weren't ready, they were very polite and tried to speed things up. If you stay on a weekend like we did, make sure you let the front desk know if you want maid service. Otherwise, there is no service on the weekends.

Downtown Disney was about a 15 minute walk and another 15 minutes from there to Disneyland. Our security check was minimal considering we went to Disneyland on a Saturday.

My only complaint has nothing to do with staff or the rooms.

The elevator is awful when everyone is trying to leave for Disneyland. It was a ride in itself to make it from the 3rd floor to the lobby. From 3rd we went to 4th, down to the parking level, up to the 3rd floor, down to the 2nd floor, up to the 4th floor, down to the basement before going up to the lobby. It took us 10 minutes to make it to the lobby. Just use the stairs, right? No stairs by the elevator for going up and down the floors. There are two different areas where fire escape stairwells are located at the end of certain halls. It's ok if you want to go down to another floor, you just can't get to the lobby that way and the doors lock behind you. No key access. One stairwell ends at the parking area the other one takes you outside by the driveway entrance. I've never seen anything like this. I've never been in a hotel that does have stair access by the elevator. I don't know how the architect didn't think this one through and provide stair access. I do hope they regulate the elevator.

Bottom line: we would more than likely return, we just don't look forward to dealing with the elevator.",October 2017,Staybridge Suites Anaheim At The Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29092-d10198308-Reviews-Staybridge_Suites_Anaheim_At_The_Park-Anaheim_California.html,"Anaheim, California",hotels,4.0,4.0
Nice hotel close to the castle,"My husband and I stayed at the Carlton Hotel for one night prior to taking a Danube River Cruise. What a gem! Our room was nicely appointed with a kind bed and couch that could be made into another bed. Since it was the two of us it was nice being able to sit on a couch in the room. The bathroom was spacious as well. I wish our view had been better. We had one window that overlooked the roof of the building across the street. The hotel was very quiet. Breakfast was included. It is fairly standard food but it was good and included in the room cost. The location is situated on a hill, so you either walk down or up depending on which street you approach from. Since we didn't have a car, we arranged with the hotel to be picked up at the airport. It was about 32 Euros or the equivalent in HUF. At the exit area of the airport, a person had our name on a sign where we checked in to wait for our driver. I believe it's a company that coordinates pickups for passengers who pre-arrange airport transportation. Unfortunately, we had to wait about an hour for our driver which was annoying, but since this was our first time in Budapest, we took the safe route. It took about 40 - 50 minutes to reach the hotel. You could only pay the hotel in cash, which made it very convenient for us.

The hotel is located on the Buda side and very close to the castle. We walked up to the castle and it was a short 20 minute walk. It is quite a climb and you do need to be careful of some of the steps, but so worth seeing. The view is incredible. We almost made the changing of the guard. There is a timeline outside you can read that gives the history about the castle and grounds that's worth reading. The Buda side is much quieter than the Pest side. We loved the peace and quiet and wished we had booked more nights prior to the cruise.

We would definitely return!",May 2017,Carlton Hotel Budapest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274887-d276352-Reviews-Carlton_Hotel_Budapest-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",hotels,4.0,4.0
Good stay,"My husband and I recently stayed at Embassy Suites in Ontario CA with our two young grandchildren. Overall it was a pleasant stay. I love how the bathroom opens up to the main room and the bedroom. That made it very convenient. I wish the sink in the kitchenette was larger. It was tiny.... I like the larger sinks in other Embassy Suites where I have stayed. This is a very modern hotel and very nice, but I miss the beautiful courtyard that I associate with Embassy Suites. My grandchildren always love the water and looking for the fish.

I was very concerned when we checked in and saw a large group of girls in soccer clothes, but overall they were quiet. I heard running up and down the hall, but not late into the evening. It meant the breakfast room was crowded but tables opened up fairly quickly.

The wait staff in the dining room were amazing. The same gentleman was there both mornings and he was so attentive and efficient. Quick to clear dishes and clean tables. Breakfast was very good. I loved the assortment. Of course the grandchildren loved the pancakes!

I heard parking could be problematic, but we found a spot each night in the lot and didn't have to park on the street. I am very happy there was no parking fee.

Pros: Good cook to order breakfast. Good food selection. The hotel and grounds were kept up nicely. The room was nicely appointed.

Cons: Once the hotel was full of guests, it took a while waiting for one of three elevators. The laundry room had two washers and dryers but one washer and one dryer was out of order. I couldn't do laundry due to the one machine always being full.

My two major complaints with this hotel are the carpets in the rooms and the noise from the trains. My grandson took off his sandals in the room and was running around in bare feet. When I put on his shoes, his feet were black! I couldn't believe this hotel could have such dirty carpets. The sofa had spots on it as well. Hopefully the carpets and upholstery will be cleaned very soon....... Our view was to the front of the hotel with railroad tracks approximately 500 feet away. Trains ran continuous throughout the night and day. I'm glad we had our noise canceling machine on for the kids. Even with the machine running I could still hear the trains. Fortunately no whistles were blown. We were on the 4th floor and that was the highest floor I could get. Maybe it's quieter on a higher floor.

Bottom line: We would return!",July 2017,Embassy Suites by Hilton Ontario-Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32823-d2019775-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_by_Hilton_Ontario_Airport-Ontario_California.html,"Ontario, California",hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent Meal and Service,"We recently ate here and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's hidden from Ocean Avenue, behind the Sweets shop in a lovely little courtyard. You can either sit outside on inside. Since it was cold, we chose inside. From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and had excellent service throughout the meal. The food was delicious! I had the gnocchi and it was heavenly! We had to split the Tiramisu. Excellent choice! It was very good. I would highly recommend eating here. We're looking forward to our next visit.",January 2017,Il Tegamino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32172-d8697456-Reviews-Il_Tegamino-Carmel_Monterey_County_California.html,"Carmel, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
