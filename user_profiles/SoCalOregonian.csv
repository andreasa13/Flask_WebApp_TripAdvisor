PURE DECADENCE DESSERT,"We had a gathering in Las Vegas and for the final night get together we ordered a chiffon cake from Paris Baguette.
What a delicious and tasty cake. This will be our go to bakery each we return to Vegas.
Recommend stopping here and enjoying a very tasty dessert.",March 2021,Paris Baguette Las Vegas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d14131525-Reviews-Paris_Baguette_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
A SMALL PART OF VEGAS HISTORY,"We visited this attraction on 03/10 arriving about 1030. Admission price is $3/person which includes the small exhibition area in the visitor center, viewing of a short historical movie and the freedom to wander the grounds of the fort.
Only one building of the original fort remains to this day, located on the southeast corner, and there are a few exhibits inside but with very little signage to explain what you are looking at. This is the same problem within the visitor center. There is a piano and organ that have signs that say “Do not touch I am very old” but no information about the history of these two musical instruments.
The foundation of the ranch house was excavated and later filled back in and only a sign now marks the spot.
The small stream that runs in the same general location of Las Vegas creek is a replica of the original as the water was diverted to help supply the city of Las Vegas in 1905.
The employee in the visitor center/gift shop was very friendly and helpful.
Worth stopping and spending 30 – 45 minutes to learn a little about the history of the area before it became Sin City.",March 2021,Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d103722-Reviews-Old_Las_Vegas_Mormon_Fort-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,4.0,4.0
NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN,"While in Vegas we visited Fremont on the night of 03/08. It is less crowded during this time compared to pre Rona. No live bands were on the stage. Just street performers in their assigned areas.
There were very few freaks out compared to pre-Rona times. Also, the crowds were sparse and you could walk around without bumping into anyone.
The Chippendales were there in their photo booth and a couple pairs of scantily clad females available for photos, but overall, there were not a lot performers.
The zipline was operating and a had long queue. The overhead light show was very well done and the light show had a Peter Max vibe. But I did notice that a lot of the casino lighting needs repaired, quite a few incandescent and neon were out, giving the area a rundown feel.
It must be experienced once when you visit Vegas.",March 2021,Fremont Street Experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d102514-Reviews-Fremont_Street_Experience-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,4.0,4.0
FACTORY/SHOWROOM/MUSEUM/GIFTSHOP,"We visited this attraction on 03/08 and got there just as the free tour was starting. The tour lasts a good hour. The history of the Shelby brand is enough of a draw for the tour, but the explanation of the cars you look at is a bonus.
After the indoor portion, you are allowed into the factory area in the viewer gallery to see the Shelby’s in various stages of completion.
Some of the cars on display are for sale with no price attached, but as they say, if you have to ask you can’t afford it. Co-located in the building is a gift shop.

NICE HOTEL CLOSE TO THE STRIP,"We stayed at this property for four nights from 03/07 – 03/11. I made reservations through the properties website and was given the room I requested. However only on the 2nd floor. I recommend getting a 3rd floor room as the noise from above can be a problem.
This hotel/casino is located far enough away from the strip to be quiet, but close enough to walk to located far enough from the strip that it's quiet, but close enough you could walk to the strip if you so choose.
Every employee we encountered was friendly and helpful.
The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, furnished with a work desk, couch, end chair, kitchenette table w/2 chairs. There is a place for a microwave but you must request one to be delivered to the room. The room was immaculate upon checking in and after each daily maid visit.
The grounds are meticulously maintained and very inviting. There are two pools, the central large pool, and a lap pool at the exercise building.
There are 4 restaurants/cafes located on the grounds.
A couple minor annoyances prevent this from being a 5-star review. The shower head is on a large gooseneck and as such can not be diverted in a downward fashion. I am 6 feet and the lower half of my body could not get direct spray from the shower head.
The aforementioned lack of sound-proofing makes adjacent and hall noise an issue.
I don’t know if Nevada has legalized weed, but the smell is pervasive in certain locations on the grounds, though I did not smell any in the buildings.
The resort fee of $39/night plus tax is a little high for what you get in return. The resort fee doubled the price of the room. Room rate was 41.58/night. Total for the four-night stay with resort fee/resort fee tax was $362.08
Overall, I recommend staying here. It is a relatively comfortable and quiet location close to the strip.",March 2021,Tuscany Suites & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d224853-Reviews-Tuscany_Suites_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,4.0,4.0
A NICE RESTAURANT,"During our four day stay at the Tuscany we ate at Marilyns Cafe four times; breakfast twice, lunch and dinner once each. Service was consistently very good even with varied waitstaff. Rona restrictions are in place but once you sit down to eat you are able to remove your mask.
Since my last review it has again been remodeled and is very bright.
All four of the meals were very good and served hot. Probably the best of all was the lunch we ate. We had the Angus burger ($10.99) that was superb and cooked to perfection and the Beer Battered Cod ($12.99).
Overall the prices are reasonable, with a good waitstaff and very good food.
A great place to dine.",March 2021,Marilyn's Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d1812190-Reviews-Marilyn_s_Cafe-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,4.0,4.0
PATHETIC SERVICE,"We stopped here for a late lunch on 03/09 at 1445.
We entered the restaurant lobby area and had to wait 5 minutes before the hostess came over and told us it would be a 25 minute wait. We put our name on the list and were told we would have to wait outside as there were already 2 people in the lobby area. So we waited outside. After 25 minutes and still not being called I went inside to inquire when we could expect to be seated. I was told they were short staffed and it would be another 20 minutes. If it wasn’t for the wife having her heart set on Pancit Palabok and Halo-Halo I would have called it quits then. So back outside I wait. After the allotted 20 minutes I enter again and am told they are just about ready for us, again I was told they were short staffed. After an additional 10 minutes bringing the total wait time to just under an hour we were lead to a booth.
Inside the restaurant, there were three tables occupied and every other table was piled high with dirty dishes.
Our drink orders were taken along with the food order. We ordered Pancit Palabok ($11.99) and Halo-Halo ($7.99).
The food was delivered within 15 minutes but no drinks. So the waitress went back and got our drinks.
After eating, the waitress came over and asked if there was anything else. We said we are still waiting on the Halo-Halo. She had forgotten that item. We were never offered a refill on the drinks.
The overall impression of this restaurant is one of chaos and lack of good management. The tables that were full of dirty dishes when we entered were still full of dirty dishes when we left.
The floor needed cleaning as there were napkins and other items strewn about.
It just gave an impression of a lackadaisical attitude.
On the plus side the Panci and Halo-Halo were very good, but not enough to overcome the other failings at this restaurant.
Total for our meal was $43.31
I CAN NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant.",March 2021,Max's Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d5063860-Reviews-Max_s_Restaurant-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,2.0,4.0
GAVE IT A TRY,"We had lunch here on 03/08 and plates were $10.99 each with an Iced Tea ($1.39) and water for a total tab of $23.37 before tip.
Due to restrictions in place the buffet is set up so you point out what you want and the waitstaff dishes it up and then hands you the plate.

COFFEE SHOP,"Caffe Bottega is a small coffee shop located close to the casino. It serves up coffee along with pastry’s, bagels, and morning sandwiches. We had breakfast from here on March 9. Two 16 oz coffees ($2.99 each), 2 donuts ($1.99 each) and a bagel ($4.25) for a cost of $15.40.
Coffee and food was good, but the service is a little slow. The coffee is brewed into air pots then dispensed. I counted 14 pumps for each 16 oz cup of coffee. Looks as though they need new air pots that dispense the coffee a little faster.",March 2021,Caffe Bottega,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d8004823-Reviews-Caffe_Bottega-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,3.0,4.5
"GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE","We stopped here on 02/14 for lunch arriving about 1145 and after having our temperature checked were immediately seated. Service was very courteous, prompt and professional.
For lunch we had an antipasto of Prosciutto Crudo ($16). I had a 1 ltr San Pellegrino ($5), my wife had a glass of water and an Aperol Spritz ($13).
The Prosciutto Crudo was very tasty and fresh. It was served along with a home-made bread and balsamic.
For the entrée I had the Margherita Pizza also known as a “1982 – Italy wins the world cup” ($16) and my wife had the Casarecce Mamma Silvana ($18).
For dessert we split a very tasty cheesecake ($8).
We also ordered a 1985 – Angelo’s Dad Opens a Deli – “A Buttiga” Pizza for takeaway.
All entrees were very tasty and served very hot.
Overall a very enjoyable dining experience.
Price of the meal before tip $102.23.
A little on the steep side but in a prior review my title says it “You Get What You Pay For” The food, service and friendliness of owner and employees makes the price worthwhile.

NEWER PROPERTY,"We stayed here one night on 12/10. Checked in just prior to 1500 and the front desk was very friendly and helpful. On my profile I request a top floor away from elevator. I was assigned a 3rd floor room, but the desk clerk was able to move me to the 4th floor into a king suite. The lobby area is very spacious and clean.
The hotel rooms face north and south. The north rooms over look the theater and High School. Our room was a south facing room and had views of the freeway, and the Temecula Valley.
On Friday nights during football season if you have a room on the east end of the hotel it could be problematic if there is a home game. (noise and lights)
As this is a relatively new hotel it seems as though it could have been constructed a little more sound-proofed. The traffic noise from the freeway was very noticeable in the room.
In the room every thing worked, there are USB ports aplenty. The desk lamp has plugs for European style electrical devices. No bath tub in our room, just a shower which is nice. There is a large floor safe in the closet. This is by far the largest safe I have seen in an IHG property. The A/C and heating is not central but a window unit that is controlled from the wall thermostat. It rapidly heated and cooled the room
and kept it comfortable through the night and was quiet.
The television is a large screen with a lot of features, however the view your bill feature did not work (see photo)
Due to the ongoing virus, the breakfast dining area is closed, however breakfast is available as a take-out feature. You let the server know what you want, they pack it in a Styrofoam box and you dine in your room. The cheese omelet, sausage and cinnamon roll was hot and tasty. Also affected by the virus is the usage of the pool and fitness center. Only one person or family allowed at a time in either facility as was explained by the desk clerk. We did not utilize either amenity.
Located close by (a short walk) are numerous restaurants and a movie theater.
Overall, this was a very pleasant stay. All staff we encountered clerks, breakfast server, cleaning staff were all very friendly and pleasant. All the amenities worked fine. The only drawback was the freeway noise, which may be less noticeable in a north facing room.",December 2020,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Murrieta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32764-d19105160-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Suites_Murrieta-Murrieta_California.html,"Murrieta, California",hotels,4.0,4.0

JUST A SO-SO STAY,"It may be one block from Disneyland as the crow flies but is about a 15 – 20 minute walk down Walnut, cut through the Disneyland Hotel grounds, through Downtown Disney to the entrance area.
We stayed one night here. Upon check-in were given a room on the 3rd floor and when we opened the door the occupants, who were changing, were as surprised as us. Back to the front desk for a new room and were given a room on the 4th floor in a building further away from the front desk. No apologies from the front desk about the mix-up. The new room was OK but had to call maintenance, the TV did not work. Maintenance arrived quickly and fixed this problem. My profile requests a top floor away from elevator. We were on the 4th floor, across from the elevator.
Had coffee in the morning and the creamer was bad, every package just clumped in the coffee.
When reviewing the bill, found a charge for a long distance phone call that was from the original room we were given. After bringing this to the attention of Tony on the front desk, an adjustment was made to the bill to remove the long distance charge.
