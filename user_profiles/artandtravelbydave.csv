My favorite restaurant.,"I was in Paris last November where I made 51 films which you can see on my channel; “Art and Travel by Dave.” This is the last of them. But if you like fine dining, I have saved the best for last.

Taillevent is a restaurant in Paris, founded in 1946 by André Vrinat, and now owned by the Gardinier family.

I had my first meal at Taillevent in 1989 at the tender age of 30. Lunch was $235. It was the best meal I had ever had. I forgot what my wife and I started with but she ordered Coquille St. Jaques for the main course. It was game season and I had a quail, duck, and pheasant with fois gras in a pastry shell in a brown reduction sauce. Nice and Light. It was the best thing I had ever eaten.

Back then you could smoke in restaurants. I smoked Dunhills at the time and each pack of twenty was divided by two with a separate tin foil compartment for each. When one of the wait staff noticed I had finished my tenth cigarette, he took my pack, opened it, and removed the tin foil from the other ten cigarettes. Talk about service.

Then we switched plates. They would not let us. They whisked them away, freshly prepared them, and brought them to us under the same silver canopies which covered them when they were first brought out.

Then it came time for dessert. When we tried to order, they wouldn’t let us. They said we will order for you. And after I said; “Wait a minute…” they were off. They came back with a triple mousse for me and a pear tart al a mode for my wife. We could not have chosen better.

I have recommended this to friends, all of whom have similar stories.

I ate at Taillevent again in 2008 with my wife and two girls. It was not so memorable.

We went to Spain where we had the pleasure of eating at El Cellar De Can Roca in Girona, at that time rated the best restaurant in the world. It was, simply put, the most amazing meal I had ever had. You can see a video of it on my YouTube channel: Art and Travel by Dave. The prix-fix menu was 600 Euros.

In the fall of 2019, (remember when the world was normal?) I returned to Taillevent after eating at two, three star Micheline restaurants in Paris. It did not disappoint. You can see the film on my channel. A five course prefix menu was only 350 Euros. Supremely creative cuisine which charged the taste buds and service as it was meant to be. It was one of the greatest three meals of my life.

My friend, James, who accompanied me, first turned me on to Taillevent in The 1980’s. He is an accomplished chef and has had the same experience with this fine restaurant that I have.",November 2020,Le Taillevent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d719918-Reviews-Le_Taillevent-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
La Tour D'Argent is the Grande Dame of French restaurants.,"La Tour D'Argent is the Grande Dame of French restaurants. It was a great restaurant and then fell into decline. It is said that the fil; “Ratatouille,” is based on La Tour D'Argent. I ate there with my family and was not disappointed. I had the very best fois gras that I ever had and the best chocolate mousse. We ordered the duck which was splendid. The mille fois was spectacular.

You can see a video of the meal on my YouTube channel: Art and Travel by Dave.",November 2020,Tour d'Argent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d718750-Reviews-Tour_d_Argent-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"How To Visit The Louvre in 2 Hours, 3 Hours, 4, or more.","See a film of this primer on visiting the Louvre and 42 films of the museum entitles; ""The Complete Louvre,"" on my YouTube channel: Art and Travel by Dave.

If you are only visiting for one day, be certain that the rooms you wish to see are open. I’ve just spent five full days at The Louvre making a comprehensive film of the museum. All rooms are open on the weekends. The small French Paintings and Northern European Art are closed two days per week.

The Pyramid: You want to avoid this entrance. Just make sure that you are on the correct line. Those with tickets or the museum pass can use the shorter line on the left.

The first trick is to use The Richelieu entrance. It is opposite The Rivoli Metro Stop and to the left of the main entrance. This is good for those with memberships and electronic tickets. If you get there first thing, by nine, they often do not check. Also, this is the best exit. The other exit is under The Carousel, where they steer you to shop. Do try to avoid this.

It’s best to look at The Louvre as three separate museums: The Denon Wing, The Richelieu Wing, and The Sully Wing. Any one day ticket allows three entries at any of the wings. So you can get a bite or a cup of coffee in between your visits to each wing. If you want to go back to the same wing, you will miss out on a different wing. Do note that you can get into The Sully Wing from The Richelieu Wing and vice versa. So if you want to take more breaks under the pyramid, you can use this scheme.

So, tip number two: Get there early. If you had to visit one museum at opening time, this would be the one. Naturally, have your museum pass or ticket in hand.

If you want to see our lady of The Louvre, go to The Denon wing and bear right up the stairs. You will get to a hallway with The Winged Victory on your right. To your left are the two Michelangelo’s Slaves, including The Dying Slave. Behind you is Roman art. Ascend to the Winged Victory and make a right.

Now gander upon the Grand Gallery, and take your time. To your immediate right is a section of International Gothic and Early renaissance art. If this is not your cup of tea, skip it. But examine the three Giotto’s on your left. This is where renaissance painting began. Move slowly up until The Mona Lisa room. This is, to me, one of the best parts of the museum. Go past The Mona Lisa room to see The Raphael’s and stop when you see The Voltera; David Slaying Goliath in the middle facing you. There is a bathroom to your right.

Unless you are keen on Baroque art, go no further. If you are, continue to The Caravaggio’s and then turn back to The Mona Lisa Room. There are a fair amount of Leonardo’s outside this room, which have been temporarily moved to The Leonardo Exhibition. Please see my film on this exhibit. Stand in the airplane security line to see her and don’t dismiss the art surrounding it, especially The Wedding at Cana by Veronese behind you.

After Mona, go behind her to see the fantastic “Pastoral Concert” by Titian, though I think it to be a Giorgione. It inspired many an artwork, not the least of which: Manet’s “Luncheon on The Grass,” across the river at The D’Orsay.

You emerge on the other side at Great French Historical Paintings. They are not all historical but they are all great. Here you will see the biggies: The Raft of The Medusa, The Coronation of Napoleon, and Liberty Leading The People. Turn right to The Winged Victory and descend the stairs. Go straight ahead To The Michelangelos at the far end. If your goal was a two hour visit, you are done. You can proudly say that you have visited The Louvre.

If you wish to expand your visit to three hours and Renaissance sculpture appeals to you, go down the stairs behind The Michelangelos.

Then, ascend the stairs and go to where you came in. There is a great collection of Roman statues next to the exit.

Then go to The Sully Wing to see The Venus D’Milo. The go upstairs to see the small French paintings, such as Watteau, Chardin, Boucher, Fragonard and Ingres. This will put you at the three hour mark.

You can, of course go through their mammoth Egypt collection but be forewarned if you go in, it will take about two hours to get out. The same holds true for their oriental section, which is really middle eastern art. Also the myriad of French decorative art will take up two hours as well.",November 2020,Louvre Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188757-Reviews-Louvre_Museum-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5

gone downhill,"I have been eating at Donavan’s Pub in Woodside for over 40 years. It used to be a friendly place and was awarded the best burger in NY by one of the local papers. Then the owners sold off their restaurant both there and in their Bayside location. It has since gone downhill whereas The Bayside location is classier, has better food, and friendlier service.

I ordered a medium rare burger and it was raw. I sent it back and the very same burger, with my two bites taken out of it, was returned to me medium well. I didn’t complain and ate my burger.

I asked for the manager, Chris. Two weeks prior I had picked up an order and when I returned to my building, I found the order was wrong. I called Donavan’s, spoke to Chris, and he said that he would give me a free burger the next time I came in. But Chris wasn’t there. I spoke to another manager who told me that Chris had no authorization to give me a free burger unless he were to pay it for himself. I replied; “Do you think that I am trying to scam you out of an F’ing burger? At this point the manager told me I was no longer welcome in the restaurant.

I waited for my check but instead a bellicose troglodyte came up to my table and started berating me. He may have been the owner. He wore a baseball cap. Finally, I could take no more, put my business card on the bar and said; “send me a bill.”

I walked out and the troglodyte followed me. At this point he had the wonderful idea to call Chris. I do not know what Chris said since all I heard was the troglodyte’s insults calling me a male appendage. I tried to calm down by walking around the block as he followed me, took pictures of me, and insulted me calling me names for all of Woodside to hear. Then when I calmed down, I tried to go in and pay but the troglodyte blocked the door and told me I couldn’t pay now.

I had taken business associates to Donavan’s Pub for decades. I took relatives there from out of town. We have even had our company Christmas parties there. Needless to say, Donavan’s Pub in Woodside will never see my shadow again. I will eat at the Bayside location as I have from time to time, where my fiend’s sister is the manager and where they treat their customers with the proper respect.",June 2019,Donovan's Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48914-d1055026-Reviews-Donovan_s_Pub-Woodside_Queens_New_York.html,"Woodside, New York",restaurants,1.0,4.0
