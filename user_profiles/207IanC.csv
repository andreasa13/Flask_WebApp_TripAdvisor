Sunday roast on the doorstep...literally,"Ordered 2 Sunday roasts, delivered to the door, only phoned on Sunday morning, very helpful, great value at 7.50 each, no delivery charge, we live about 3 miles away.

Quietly attractive village.,"Like most other reviews it's hard not to find the quaint feeling of this village somewhat nostalgic with a glimpse into the past. However it is just a short visit. We parked in the free car park and walked down the reasonably steep hill, note no footpath, and through the centre to the river and back, takes less than hour unless you visit a cafe or pub.

"Everything a hotel should be, a modern vintage","We were very fortunate to stay for a night and have a taster menu in the evening. We hired a classic car for 24 hours, an Alfa Spider from Vintage Classics in Melksham, and the whole experience was perfect. The room was stunning, overlooking the entrance courtyard, he grounds were beautiful and the spa delightful. After a walk and a swim came dinner. There were 10 of us, split 6 and 4 and the constant innovative stream of mini courses was a delight to the taste buds. Finished off with a whisky in the bar at midnight.

Amazing Alfa fun,"Hired an 1972 Alfa Spider for 24 hours from Friday midday to Saturday midday to stay at Whatley Manor. From my initial enquiry to the final wave goodbye the experience was exceptional. All the paperwork stuff is clearly explained, social distancing was well handled and didn't affect the enjoyment. Videos about the experience and the car in advance where very use. It was a professional experience but also a personal one as well, you really felt how they cared for the cars and know so much about them.
The car itself was great fun to drive, old school, choke, heavy stearing and soft brakes, low to the road real driving. We were lucky with weather to be able to have the top down.

Complete post lockdown fail,"So disappointed, having stayed here before and really enjoyed.
Fully aware of the current lockdown rules, pity the Hilton isn't. For such a massive chain with a once great reputation the messages were unclear, uninforced and ill conceived.
In and out but no one way. Masks in some areas, not in the bar right next to reception, staff unfriendly, no explanations all they wanted was to charge from parking, not on the website, apparently management decision.
Room was okay but corridors unclean, lining strewn about. Minimal breakfast options, pool closed, wouldn't even bring a coffee to the room, reluctant to bring ice. Post lockdown it seems the so called poorly treated travel industry has forgotten service, experience and value, I will support and independent next time who probably has been offered a fat government handout.

"Good service, too much plastic, OK food","Visited on a hot Saturday, couldn't book, but fortunately a garden bench came free as we arrived. Took time to download the app, get signal then order drinks, which took 10 min from order but 30 min from arrival. Food came on time, veggie options limited, fish n chip looked good, my ploughman's was basic, not the nicest brie ever fish was good, baguette average. Staff serving did well and worked hard, no sign of any management as cyclists were allowed to sprawl where they like, eating their own food, no table allocation.
Worst of all as other reviews point out was the waste, single use plastic overload, one broken glass would be safer than all that plastic, also, no response to any of these comments, poor, when it should be a great place",August 2020,The Bankes Arms Country Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551718-d1135789-Reviews-The_Bankes_Arms_Country_Inn-Studland_Swanage_Isle_of_Purbeck_Dorset_England.html,"Studland, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,3.5

We booked a table in the garden, there was live music, a good mix of rock and ska, a few sing a longs but not so loud you couldn't talk, ( that makes me sound old, proper gigs for Lound music ) a great blend.

Decent under the circumstances,"Hard to give a proper review as restaurants and diners are coming to terms with the Covid situation. We have now been to three restaurants since lockdown has been relaxed, difficult to know what the guidelines are but all three did it differently. So, starting with the positives, all staff wore masks, we were greeted, shown to our table then given clear instructions on how the service would be managed. Drinks left on a table and we collected our food from the open plan kitchen. All very odd, I imagine they thought it reduced movement, but instead of the staff moving around the diners were moving around past other diners, so not sure it was thought through fully.
The decor was modern and inventive, a nod to spoons and forks, the food was very good, as others have said our deal included cocktails which they couldn't make but it was still good value. I will probably go again as there were more pluses than negatives,",July 2020,Schpoons & Forx,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186262-d9593099-Reviews-Schpoons_Forx-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Surprisingly good hotel,"A very good deal through Travel Zoo, I didnt expect much, a little out of town near Reykjavík Airport.
The hotel is owned by Icelandair whose office are next door.
We were made very welcome, the reception and lobby area were tasteful and warm. Some reviews say the rooms were small, ours was fine up on the third floor. There is not much within a ten minute walk, but the buffet evening meal in the hotel was excellent and reasonable by Icelandic standards, breakfast is expensive. We walked into the centre twice, about 25 to 30 minutes in snow passed the frozen lake. The first few minutes are tricky as the site is currently surrounded by building works, however, no noise.
The staff were helpful for trips or local information, we enjoyed walking around Reykjavik. We also visited a local outdoor pool and hot tub area, for a fiver.

All the same brands owned by the same soulless companies who care so little about customers.

"Left before eating, made to feel so uncomfortable","Not sure why this place gets such good reviews. Also I hate writing bad reviews as I want to share positivity and enjoyable experiences. There was nothing positive about our brief visit. I had booked on line for 5.30pm on a Saturday. When arrived we were not greeted and viewed with suspicion, they scanned the system and I had to point out my name. First comment was you must be out by 7. Whilst we intended to be this was rude and unfriendly. We were then shoved between to other couples, tables so close together. Terrible atmosphere, weird, I guess trendy lighting, then the waiter was disappointed we hadn't been before because he had to do something and show us how to order on a tablet, might appeal to some, not my idea of a dining experience. He was bored, disinterested, mumbled something about interactive tables then left.
I have been to a number of Japanese restaurants and this menu was bland and hard to use, then came the eye-watering Tapas prices. After a coue minutes discussion we left, they just shrugged, then the booking app acused me of not turning up. Went to a simple Thai place a few doors down, much friendlier.

I did a few searches and Black Pepper kept coming up. I liked the idea of a relatively new bespoke business, the menu was interesting and prices seemed reasonable. I did miss the fact that it is BYOB, they do have wine by the bottle and bottled lager, I was able to nip to the local shop and buy a couple of beers.
The service was plesent, the food was excellent, I think the memu must change regularly which is great if you visit regularly. I had the ham and pea risotto with perfectly cooked poached egg, others had pate, all good, for mains 2 had steak and 2 duck with zesty orange mash which was a delightful first.
Just be aware they close quite early, we had a table for 7.30, by 9.30 they were starting to tidy up, we were last to leave at 9.50. Also its quite small so advisable to book.

Thira is a cruise ship hub, little to attract any genuine explorers.
The hotel has the same view as many others. It seems beyond that nobody cares. Rooms are okay, but this is an expensive hotel for little return.

Yiu can easy walk to Thira from a path that runs through the hotel about halfway up. You can also walk the other way to Oia, about 2.5 hours, both worth doing. We then got the bus back from Oia to Thira, then walk or bus back to the hotel.

Lovely 2 night stay,"We stayed here as part of an 11 day trip round the Cycledes Islands. After Athens and Mykonos, Naxos was a welcome relief, calm, gentle, reasonably priced. This hotel captured this atmosphere. The staff were friendly and the location perfect, right by the beach across a small light trafficked road. Great for sunsets. The hotel had half-price sunbeds, I think 5e.
Our room was simple and cheap, we didn't pay for a sea view, it was only 30m to the beach.
The bar, restaurant had great views and the food was reasonable. Breakfast was included.
Could have stayed longer. We did a day's tour of the island which was enjoyable. Best restaurants were in the main square not the port seafront.",October 2019,Ippokampos Beachfront Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189431-d6428566-Reviews-Ippokampos_Beachfront_Hotel-Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Naxos, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Shirley who?,"This places bares no relation in reality to the 1980s film, however its a cool bar with great views, typical overpriced undervalued Mykonos experience.

Pretty but expensive.,"Visited Mykonos for 3 days whilst island hopping. Went into the town a few times. Whilst little venice is pretty, and busy, It all feels like a Gucci theme park, the only ride you'll be taken on is the overinflated price of everything. The general food and drink motto, is charge more for less. Somebody somewhere has there pockets full and ill bet its not the local Greek inhabitants.
However the sunset are worth watching, otherwise not for me. All a bit fake.",September 2019,Little Venice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g662620-d519760-Reviews-Little_Venice-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5

Great hotel. A little overpriced when you are there,"This is a lovely hotel, part of a group of 5, in the same area, steep hill to the beach, free mini bus available if required to navigate the hill. Private beach available. We went in September, pool very cold, so hardly used by anyone. Breakfast was included in our priced, it was amazing, awesome food, great service, relaxed, we had 3 wonderful leasurely visits.
However the rest of the food is average and overpriced. The drinks are stupidly expensive. We could aford to stay here but could not justify the overinflated prices, they rely on rich people who don't need to watch the bank balance. That said, it's still worth going, the decor is fabulous, the rooms were comfortable, staff are friendly, there is a free regular bus to and from The town, takes 39 minutes, the pick up from the port was included, would recommend, would stay again.",September 2019,Royal Myconian,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g4327604-d250644-Reviews-Royal_Myconian-Elia_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
