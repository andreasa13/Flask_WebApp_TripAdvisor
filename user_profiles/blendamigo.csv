Difficult,"In few words. It is an absolute Beauty from the outside, and a big disappointment from the inside. Other smaller churches in Palermo would be better to visit",August 2020,Cattedrale di Palermo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187890-d246489-Reviews-Cattedrale_di_Palermo-Palermo_Province_of_Palermo_Sicily.html,"Sicily, Italy",attractions,2.0,4.5
Don't understand !,"I really don't understand why this museum has more than 3.5 stars! The interior is well designed and that's it! The Greek icons are modest. One can find better preserved ones in museums in Berlin, Rome and Madrid !
I was expecting more of THE ACROPOLIS museum!",February 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
"Nice Falafel "" with eggplants!""","I found the idea of putting eggplants in a falafel sandwich bizarre at first, but I have to admit I liked the taste of it. No other falafel place would do that in Syria or Lebanon. Worth a try",February 2020,Falafellas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4293737-Reviews-Falafellas-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Overrated,"I have to admit, I might had too high expectations. But the whole thing is just columns. To be honest the view of Athens and the sea you get from above is worth the money more than the Acropolis it self",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5
Friendly staff good yogurt,"We were advised by a worker called ""Zol""! Very friendly and thorough. Yogurt was yummy and in different variation. I think it's a must to try in Athens. You can decide later if it's your thing or not",February 2020,Fresko Yogurt Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2148019-Reviews-Fresko_Yogurt_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
One of the best Momos,We tried three different types ! Meat is the best ! Actually one can only choose between 4 options.

A Bit overrated . Not that much to see . Do not take a guide,"If ruins is what interest you, go to Ercolani !
Pompei is big and a lot of scenes just repeat themselves.

A must for archeological freaks. A LOT better than Pompei,"First of all if you are staying only for a couple of days in Napoli, this is the place to go and not Pompei. It is much better reserved. An Audio Guide will be very helpful. An amazing look into history",September 2019,Parco Acheologico di Ercolano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g670330-d195507-Reviews-Parco_Acheologico_di_Ercolano-Ercolano_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Ercolano, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5

Splendid K체nefe. Average Service,"The k체nefe here is just good. The right fresh taste and the right amount of syrup, which is essential for the texture.
