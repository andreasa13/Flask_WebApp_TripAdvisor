Acropolis!!!!,"It’s a must do in Athens, it’s the large buildings you can see from everywhere in the city, way up in the hill, and at night...it takes your breath away! Don’t buy your tickets at the entrance, or you can wait up to one hour during summer months. Buy tickets at Hadrian’s library or Ancient Agora, or at any other Archeological site, 30 euros, good for 5 days, it allows entrance to all sites. Easiest entrance is near the museum corner.
Once you start walking up hill, the stairs and hilltop is very slippery, huge crowds, but it moves fast, once at the top, plenty of space to walk around. Careful rocks all uneven and super slippery, wear good comfy shoes .
Lots to see off the hill too, as you walk down to the north side and south sides, down Mars hill. You can easily do it in 4 to 5 hours.",August 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Massive wonder,"This place has only one building ruins, but it’s gigantic!!!! Fantastic picture taking, it’s wonderful.
Super close to the Arch, tiny gift shop, you can buy cheap water bottles at entrance. Cross the street to go to the National Park.",August 2018,Temple of Olympian Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242844-Reviews-Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Central Location,"This Hotel is above average for the typical small Greece Hotel. Rooms are comfy, clean modern. The roof top views of the Acropolis are phenomenal, the location is 1/2 blocks to Plaka shopping, only blocks from Monasteriki, Ermou street, other locations, and metro. There is a mini market next door, elevator for luggage, quiet, clean and tidy. They let me borrow an electric plug, and helped me with directions. The particular room I had, had a small shower, it was tight. If you are a big person, you should ask about shower space in Greece hotels, they tend to be wet rooms vs full bathrooms.
The food service was adequate in the provided breakfast, they really try to serve a selection of Greek foods and continental selection. It was quiet, and cozy. For the price this place is very decent, I would stay here again and would recommend, location was the best. I am a bargain traveler and look for clean, safe, places.",August 2018,Plaka Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d197721-Reviews-Plaka_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great location,"So this Hotel is steps from a great restaurant and bar at each sides, a church right across.
The rooms are basic, clean, tidy, with wet rooms for bathrooms. The staff is super sweet and friendly, there is a lift for luggage starting on the first floor. You will to carry your bag up a couple of stairs if your foolish to bring a big bag.
It’s one block to Starbucks, great local inexpensive Greek fast food places. Lots of shopping markets only within a ten block radius, the Plaka, Monasteriki, Ermou St, fish market, fruit market, metro. It’s also only 15 minutes walking to many Archeological sites. They provide a basic eat in self serve kitchen with microwave and fridge. The beds are very firm, normal Greek beds apparently, can’t compare to
US hotel beds, totally different.
The location is ideal for a quick stay. The staff at front desk is super nice, they made the place stand out from other hotels I stayed at. I would book this place again or recommend.",August 2018,Tempi Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d253761-Reviews-Tempi_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,3.5
Must do,"The museum is a modern beautiful space, packed during summer months. Long line to enter but it moves fast, your bags needs to go thru metal detector at door. Several floors, no picture taking, they provide a good flow and great detailed information of items. If you like museums, it’s a wonderful collection you need to add to your complete Acropolis visit. There is a cafeteria on the second floor, with inexpensive snacks and drinks, great plaza sitting. Make sure to keep your museum ticket, you need to show it while changing floors, since they allow folks to go to cafeteria only if they desired.",August 2018,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Bucket list must do,"Get ready to be wowed wowed and then wowed !!! Fantastic collection of all the items found from several sites. If you love museums give yourself at least 4 hours, and that’s a fast space. There is so much art to look at, you don’t want to miss anything or skip it. Its inexpensive, will need to check in a large bag, it’s a no no, for free, you can take as many pictures as you like.
It will wow you!!! Only a ten minute walk from central Plaka area.",August 2018,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice surprise,"So this place is fantastic for its amazing uniqueness, made of stone, and modernized, and plain fun to run amuck where athletes run.
Then, as an added bonus, there is a small museum, they hold several to
Many real used torches in past Olympic ceremonies, and copies of the posters!!!! It’s totally cheap to walk in, and you can stay as long as possible, run around, laugh !!!!",August 2018,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Girls weekend fun,"My first time at the Mirage! The rooms were very stylish hip modern, deco. The bed and pillows were actually very comfy, I'm usually a picky sleeper! I was able to check in early, the restaurants were good for breakfast, lunch or night cap drinking. The farmhouse breakfast cafe was excellent, especially the truffle mushroom sandwich. I went to the In house show, the Beatles, it was fantastic!
The pool area was very large, extra charge if you wanted to sit in shade or get VIP service,obviously.
In general it's a very good location in the strip, easy to get there from airport via Uber.
I would recommend this hotel to others.",November 2016,The Mirage Hotel & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d97737-Reviews-The_Mirage_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,4.0,4.0
Classic SF,"While in SF, it's a given you need to visit Alcatraz Island. It's so iconic and famous, you must do. Ideally, you should buy tickets before you get here, it's like Disneyland to get in. Once you are on island, there is crowds control, so it's safe and comfortable.
You need tennis shoes, pants and jackets, scarf . If you get a little sea sick, take Dramamine,or at least half a tab, to settle your stomach. The ocean waters are choppy.
If you need to buy tics when in SF that should be your priority. Parking is the easiest in the super am, near Fishermans warf. Don't be surprised that parking is just as valuable as gold, and so maybe near 60.00 per day or so.
Pack a lite snack or power bar, camera!
You are all set, have fun.",June 2016,Alcatraz Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d102523-Reviews-Alcatraz_Island-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.5
Girls fun vacation,"It's a beautiful fun hotel. Make sure to plan ahead as far as weather, huricaine season started early last year in late June. I was hit with a hurricane , and the hotel kept us in shelter for a small price, and they provided food in a bag. Free open bar in bedroom.

The staff is wonderful, very nice. The wine selection is not the best, but ok. The food selection is good to great, for all inclusive, except sushi. I'm from SF so fresh Sushi doesn't compare in Mexico, it's not their specialty.

You can take several water related tours, or visit to local town. I loved the Eco walk / camel ride/ tequila tasting tour. There also a tour to a local glass shop. The town close by is not a big thing, very small, but mixed with old traditional buildings with modern hotels. The hotel was moderate crazy loud, not too bad, More on the quiet side. The weekend had louder guest visiting. They offered daily entertainment, and dancing. I would visit again.",September 2015,Hotel Riu Palace Cabo San Lucas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g152515-d503041-Reviews-Hotel_Riu_Palace_Cabo_San_Lucas-Cabo_San_Lucas_Los_Cabos_Baja_California.html,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico",hotels,4.0,4.0
Comfy stay,"This location is an easy 5 to 10 mins walking from the town, 5 mins from the beach! Very reasonable priced, great Irish breakfast. The room was comfy, very clean, and a good sleep. The lady of the house was very sweet, gives plenty of advice of places to hit and drive.
Portrush turns out to be a very nice cute town, right on the coast, victorian charm.
Not too many pubs to visit, but they do have two excellent restaurants next to the water front, with reasonable prices, and cool and different dishes.
The town had a large arcade for kids and teens, which i had not seen anywhere else, and one casino for adults.",September 2013,Anvershiel House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g209952-d952298-Reviews-Anvershiel_House-Portrush_County_Antrim_Northern_Ireland.html,"Portrush, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,5.0
Close to Galway,"I stayed here, since it was only 10 mins to Galway. The Hotel was right off a major highway, and right accross a big shopping center/ movie theater.
If you use the GPS, it's called ""Best western"", I think it was recently renamed.
The rooms were large, roomy, very clean. Our particular room, they forgot toilet paper, shampoo, and extra towels. We called service, and got our supplies right away.
They have a restaurant to eat all meals of the day, best price starts at near ten euro for a meal. Plenty of parking for your cars, and safe area.",September 2013,Maldron Hotel Galway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g212512-d212626-Reviews-Maldron_Hotel_Galway-Oranmore_Galway_County_Galway_Western_Ireland.html,"Oranmore, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.0
Must see,"I visited the castle and it was mind blowing. The rich history of course is insane.
You need to line up early to get a ticket, the price is not bad at all. You then get asigned a time when your tour will begin. I think 20 people per tour group. There will be a tour guide, and they take you from room to room anda quick brief description of the room you visit.
You visit estate rooms, a meeting room, a room that has a magnificent throne, yes a throne! Finally, a grand hallway where the actual president of Ireland is sworn in.
Then, you go outside to see the inside of a tower. The lower levels of the tower has an original Viking wall, and the old moat that cirlced the ancient city of Dublin when first established.
First tours started at 9am and last ones at 430pm, depend when you visit. The whole tours takes 1.5 hours.",September 2013,Dublin Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d214882-Reviews-Dublin_Castle-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.0
Harry Potter like library comes to life,"This is the most amazing library you will see in your life. (well maybe)
This rooms becomes almost 3D as you enter it. It is a magnificent long room, feels like a mile long, and stacked high with books everywhere you look. Everyone who enters the rooms is absolutly quiet as you get blown away by the sheer grandour of the place. The center has glass cases on display with very unique books from around the wolrd.
I cant's say enough about how great this place is. You must see it!
I got almost to the end of the day, and so the entrance fee was cut in half. I think it was ten euro's to enter to see the Book of Kells, and then you enter and exit thru this library. I paid only 5 euro to enter, but I needed maybe two hours to really enjoy the place.
If you are a nut for architecture and books, give your self a good 2 to 3 hours to visit.
You will first enter the museum area, see the book of kells first, maybe 1.5 hours, then the library, 1.5 hours, then the store as you exit.
I have traveled the world, I have not seen a library like this yet.",September 2013,The Book of Kells and the Old Library Exhibition,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d215062-Reviews-The_Book_of_Kells_and_the_Old_Library_Exhibition-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Rich history,"This place is so rich in history of Ireland, it's a must. The very essence of Ireland cant' be told without this jail.
It's so magnifent, so tragic, so unusual for it's time. It's a very different jail than ""normal"" modern jails.
I totally recommend you visit this place. If yo have young kids, it might be a tad scary for them, if you have teens, it will be very cool for them.",September 2013,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d191025-Reviews-Kilmainham_Gaol_Museum-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,4.0,4.5

Historical treasure to experience,"I visited Ashford Castle as a day tourist, I was not staying there.
Even so, my friends and I asked if we could have lunch, which they were so generous to serve us. I felt like a princess in this castle, having tea and lunch.
The servers were so sweet and nice, and were very attentive to answer all our questions. We got the best history shorts of the local area, the architecture, the current state of the castle. Our server gave us an extensive plan of locations to visit, which we did.
I am very grateful to him, and sad that his name escapes me now.
I would visit this location, it will wow the socks off you!",September 2013,Ashford Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g663560-d246452-Reviews-Ashford_Castle-Cong_County_Mayo_Western_Ireland.html,"Cong, Ireland",hotels,5.0,5.0
Do it!,"Totally a good way to see and do London on your first visit.
I love see and do everything in 24 hours, and this did it. You also get a free cruise included, which was an excellent value.
I also visited London in the off season, in September, but the lines were not too long to enter museums or other attractions.
The bus takes you right thru the famous Tower Bridge! Easy to get the best pictures of the city.For the price, it's not bad. You can by this pass at the exit of the airport, easy to do so.
You should look into the London Pass too.",September 2013,Golden Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d663796-Reviews-Golden_Tours-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,3.5
Do It!,"Totally recommend to do this if you are visiting for the first time, or have kids, and don't have a car. They city driving had too many one way streets, and the bus is perfect.
The pass is good for two days, but it's a paper ticket, make sure not to loose it.
The city of Dublin is large, and the whole route takes about two hours, and it's a one way route.
The driver even let us off near another attraction, making easy for us to get off safely.",September 2013,DoDublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d195416-Reviews-DoDublin-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
