"Amazing location, generous portions, great staff, lovely food","Incredible location overlooking the Ancient Agora and Stoa, as well as the Acropolis towering over the restaurant. The service was amazing, with our smiling waiter directing us to the seat with the best views of the Acropolis. He spoke good english - and apparently spanish and german too. The food came quickly, was very good for such a touristy location, and the portion sizes were very generous. Plus, they top it off with a free desert of panacotta and a little jug of amaretto/honey/red wine liquer. Great place, definately stands out on Adrianou avenue.",August 2020,Diodos Archaias Agoras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1076890-Reviews-Diodos_Archaias_Agoras-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great views, appallingly unfriendly and unhelpful staff","The only time I've visited a major tourist site in Europe and made to feel very unwelcome, borderline unwanted.

The acropolis was, architecturally, stunning, the views were magnificent and the facilities were pretty good.However, I'd suggest management perhaps invest in some signage, or arrows to indicate the one way system and out of bounds areas, rather than instructing staff to shout at visitors for crossing invisible lines or moving in the wrong direction along lanes whith no visible dividing lines. Teaching the ticket kiosk staff to recognize the acropolis's own online ticket voucher would also be a good start. If you really want to go overboard, why not suggest to your staff that paying visitors are essential and should be made welcome, rather than a nuisance. In essence, an amazing site, staffed by very irritable, officious, unhelpful and grudging individuals, who seemed to view their job as harrying us through as fast as possible.",August 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5
"Fraser the tour guide was amazing, generous beer quantities and very informative tour","We had our tour with Fraser on the 27th of August. From the very start Fraser was welcoming, got us to mingle easily and entertained us while giving for on lots of interesting beer and brewing facts and history. The tour was great, each pub was historic and unique,and the tour had a lovely atmosphere. It felt more like visiting pubs and tasting beer with a knowledgeable friend than a stuffy formal tour. Fantastic value for money,10/10 reccomend. Special mention for Fraser,who outdid himself as our guide.",August 2019,Belgian Beer Tasting in Brussels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g188644-d11454659-Belgian_Beer_Tasting_in_Brussels-Brussels.html,"Brussels, Belgium",activities,5.0,5.0
The food and staff put a silver lining on my breakdown,"I broke down just down the road from the Leadburn - only just managed to get my car into the car park. Not only did the lovely staff on duty allow me to use the restaraunt phone, but were incredibly friendly and sympathetic. The food I had while waiting for a mechanic to arrive was also amazing - tasty, large portion size and great value for money. Will definately cbe returning once my car is fixed !",March 2018,The Leadburn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1068914-d4291423-Reviews-The_Leadburn-Penicuik_Midlothian_Scotland.html,"Penicuik, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great friendly restaurant with insane food,"The staff and atmosphere at El Abuelo is invredible - you immediately feel like you have known the owner for years. My family went at the start of our week in Cangas de Onis and we ate nowhere else all that week. The portions are huge, and the food is exceptional,especially the traditional Asturian dishes like Fabada Asturiana. What really makes this restaraunt however is the cidra (cider) dispenser, which is shaped like an old man who pours cider from his head when you press his hat ! One of my favourite places to eat in the Asturias.",July 2017,El Abuelo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662890-d1821250-Reviews-El_Abuelo-Cangas_de_Onis_Asturias.html,"Cangas de Onis, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Will never be my first choice,"To be fair to 1815 it's a nice place to sit and have a drink with friends, even if it a little expensive. However,certain members of the bar staff are extremely unpleasant, making innapropriate comments and using homophobic language when speaking to myself and friends I was with. Really discouraged me from returning, even though I am a Union member.",March 2018,1815 The Union Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186225-d12702223-Reviews-1815_The_Union_Bar-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.5
