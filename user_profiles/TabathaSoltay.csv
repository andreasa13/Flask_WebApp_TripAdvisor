Large dated grandur,"This hotel is well located, and has lots of the comforts of a grand old European hotel; amazing staff, large grand rooms, a good breakfast and a small spa.

The rooms are large, comfy and have more than just a bed with space for luggage, a writing table and ample places to sit (something newer hotels seem to lack). However they are dated and showing their age a little. Outlets to charge your phone are plentiful, just not convenient and on the hottest days of summer the AC might just not get the room cool.

The bathrooms are spacious and clean with great products.

Breakfast was ample and the staff were attentive (there during COVID so they had to serve us - but it was a buffet with plenty to choose from). The staff did put health first and would greet customers at the restaurant with an invitation to wear a mask (provided) and hand sanitizer. Staff at reception were also very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is very well located. Close to everything and a great place to start your exploring of Vilnius. Also there is a small spa which is a great way to spend a late afternoon hour or two after exploring all day. The spa area is clean (and the hotel rooms have bathrobes to make accessing the spa more comfortable).

I would stay here again.",August 2020,Artis Centrum Hotels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274951-d290833-Reviews-Artis_Centrum_Hotels-Vilnius_Vilnius_County.html,"Vilnius, Lithuania",hotels,4.0,4.0
An amazing addition to the Riga dinning scene,"This place has it all, amazing staff, friendly head chef, and of course food that is out of this world.

Everything is local and fresh, and the decor features photos of many of the suppliers, so fresh and delicious is the key here. Everything is so well thought out in terms of the food, from presentation to flavour combinations, and knowing that everything comes from Latvian farmers makes it an even more enjoyable experience.

And of course the food is just WOW. Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious. The Chef really honours the ingredients! We ordered the meat plate and it was stacked with a little bit of everything. Possibly the best rotisserie chicken I have ever had along with the best ribs in Riga (these were literally falling off the bone). And the burgers are amazing. And nothing is forgotten, with sauces to complement the meat plate and some the tastiest bun for the burger!

The staff are attentive, helpful and friendly. They also really know their stuff making recommendations on dishes to order based on our preferences, and helping with wine pairings. The head Chef is delightful and so keen to share the concept behind this restaurant.

This might also be one of the nicest patios in Riga now. It is large with ample space between tables. Right in the heart of the Old Town, so people watching while eating steak is an added bonus.

We will be going back. A lot!",August 2020,Cock and Bull,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274967-d21223661-Reviews-Cock_and_Bull-Riga_Riga_Region.html,"Riga, Latvia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Nest sushi in the Baltics!,"If I could give Narushi a six point rating I would!

This is a hidden gem of a Japanese restaurant with fresh fish, amazing flavours, attentive staff and artistic presentations. Everything a world class sushi restaurant should be, without being too pretentious.

"Fine - just fine, not great.","Wanted a fresh salad for dinner, nothing fancy, and Talutti delivered; a fresh salad but nothing fancy. Low key, casual dining, decent food. Good for kids in need of food the recognize.

Starter was very cheesy and delicious. Arrived hot and quickly. Salads were large and served with dressing and a bun. Drinks were tasty. And the al fresco dining lead to some amazing people watching.

Good value for money,"This hotel is very well located, close to Old Town, the market and the bus / train station.

The rooms have all been recently renovated and feel clean and bright. Good lighting (to read in bed) and clean fresh bathrooms - and good water pressure even on the top floor. However, the rooms were hot and so sleeping was hard. There was very little ventilation in our room (59 - the windows face into a covered sunroom which heats up resulting in no breeze).

Staff were very friendly and accommodating.

This hotel does not have a lift, so you will be walking up stairs. The reception is on the second floor. The steps are wide and well lit.

Breakfast didn't have a huge selection, but good bread and coffee. Enough to set you up for a day of exploring. Lovely to be able to eat outside on the deck.

Parking: You have to pay extra and they don't have many spots so pre-book.

Worth the detour,"This is a must-see stop in the middle of no-where. Not one hill, but two little hills completely covered and surrounded by thousands and thousands of crosses.

I thought this would be a quick stop, but we really took our time walking (even in the pouring rain) and looking at the different crosses. Fascinating, and we are not religious at all.

Park in the parking lot not along the road.

Barely a three star!,"While the room was recently redone, the hotel felt cheap and fast. It really is a road-side motel. But, given the location (middle of nowhere) it was better than expected.

The room had no ventilation and it was hot and muggy. We had to sleep with the window open by the ""highway"" ... it is a small highway, so not too noisy.

The water pressure in the bathroom went from barely there to non-existent with issues with the hot water as well, which would come and go.

There is only one elevator and using the stairs is not possible. This can be an issue when the hotel is full.

Staff seemed overwhelmed - like they did not have enough people to deal with the number of rooms they had rented. The receptionist also served breakfast which slowed down the check-out process. Having said that, staff were very friendly and helpful. They spoke excellent English too.

The restaurant's menu is terrible, 90% of the ingredients felts canned (I had a mushroom soup that tasted like a Campbells can of soup / my partner had a pizza and the mushrooms and sauce looked and tasted canned too).",July 2020,Hotel Porto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g21000908-d1465906-Reviews-Hotel_Porto-Babrungas_Telsiai_County.html,"Babrungas, Lithuania",hotels,3.0,4.0
Passionate guide makes for an awesome tour,"We did two tours with Yellow Vilnius Free Walking Tour - both with Arminas. He is a brilliant guide, very energetic and passionate about sharing the history and current cultural state of Lithuania and Vilnius ... and because we were on two different tours he was cognizant of not repeating too much, but making sure everyone got a good feel for the flavour of Lithuania ad Vilnius.

The Alternative Tour was very cool, heading into different parts of the city that would usually be off the beaten track and talking about Lithuania today through street art! Very cool.

The Free Tour was everything I had hoped, an overview of the history of Lithuania as well as an exploration of Old Vilnius and and explanation of significant periods in the cities history (and current situation).

Would totally recommend either of these tours.",July 2020,Yellow Vilnius Free Walking Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274951-d4368275-Reviews-Yellow_Vilnius_Free_Walking_Tour-Vilnius_Vilnius_County.html,"Vilnius, Lithuania",attractions,5.0,5.0
Patio season is here and they have an amazing patio!,"Super cute find, pretty expected for Liepaja, with a rustic feel and decent food. The staff were friendly and helpful, despite being busy.

It was nice being on the deck in a semi-park like surrounding. A nice place to spend a lazy dinner.

The menu was extensive and our meals came quickly.

The garlic bread appetizer was served quickly (a little underwhelming compared to garlic bread I have had across Latvia), the spring rolls took longer (these are not regular spring rolls, they are more like little puffs stuffed with carrots and cabbage. Not quite what we were expecting, but delicious). The mains were served quite quickly and were plentiful and good.

We arrive just before a large group and the place was packed (with social distancing between tables). The staff were able to keep up with orders and seem to have their rhythm back in serving people.

I would probably eat here again. It was cute, rustic and looked cleaner than many of the other places I walked past in Leipaja.",June 2020,Pastnieka Maja,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274965-d3433641-Reviews-Pastnieka_Maja-Liepaja_Kurzeme_Region.html,"Liepaja, Latvia",restaurants,3.0,4.0

The staff were super friendly and helpful, making recommendations and explaining components of the menu (and cocktail list) to us.

The restaurant is super clean and there is space between clients. Hand sanitizer is available as are sinks.

The drinks are amazing. We skipped dessert and opted for a cocktail that tasted like an After Eight mint chocolate. It wasn't too sweet, just perfect!

I definitely enjoyed my meal here, but the food seemed expected and I was not blown away with ""creativity"". It tasked good, was filling and well presented. The bread is AMAZING and the staff kindly provided more for us.

The decor was a little bland, lots of grey and not too bright. Although we did love the light fixtures.

Creepy with a real character as a guide,"This is a short tour, just one hour, and run on time (so arrive before the hour to buy your tickets).

This was a prison so some aspects of the experience could be creepy or overwhelming for some, including standing in cells, solitary, and seeing the toilet facilities with explanations on what day-life would have been like.

The tour-guide was an ex-warden and he is a total character. Funny at moments and honest and realistic at others. He actually did the tour in Russian, Latvian and English simultaneously. I really appreciated this as I was the only English speaker in the tour.

Totally worth the time to check-out.",June 2020,Karosta Prison,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274965-d500301-Reviews-Karosta_Prison-Liepaja_Kurzeme_Region.html,"Liepaja, Latvia",attractions,5.0,4.0
Wow! Perfect place to stay,"What a find!

First - the staff. They are some of the nicest service providers I have met in Latvia. They are helpful, curious, friendly and go above and beyond.

Second - the room. It was immaculately clean, spacious and felt chic, modern and just cool! I loved the furniture, the layout and the comfy bed. Oh - and the room was huge. The bathroom was modern, clean lines, amazing walk-in shower and heated floors! Great lighting throughout, a mini-bar, storage and helpful outlets by the bed to charge phones.

Third - Breakfast. This was an amazing, and very pleasant surprise. Sitting on the patio in the morning made it feel like a beach-resort, the breeze, the lovely awning. And the food was delicious. The ala carte was nice, and the selection ample. The kitchen staff are super flexible too. All breakfasts were severed with fresh bread, jam and butter. A perfect way to start the morning, slow with good coffee and very friendly staff.

Fourth - Location. As they say; location, location, location. Just a short walk to the beach, across the street from the Amber Concert Hall. I am not sure we could have had it easier. We were able to walk to lots of great and very interesting restaurants from here.

Fifth - the staff. Have I mentioned the staff? I am going to do it again, because I was truly impressed.

"Wonderful rooms, facilities, and food - but not cheap!","So this is the perfect couple's spa getaway, but was expensive (the reason for the four / five rating).

We arrived and the staff were very friendly and very helpful. Amazing client service. Our room was ready early and exactly as I expected, clean, spacious and with a great view of the sea. The bathroom was large and bright, the bed comfortable and there was plenty of space in the room for our stuff. The room was very clean.

We loved the little spa bags that came with the room and included towels to take to the spa area. There were bathrobes, slippers as well. The facilities were set up for guests to use the spa area. The little details are important and were not missed.

The spa area was clean with extra towels, lots of hangers around the space for your bathrobe, and showers. There was only one steam room and one sauna.These were not too large, but were never crowded, and were hot - which was amazing. My main issue (and this is constant across Europe) is that the hot pools are really not that hot. And the seats didn't look comfortable, they were, but they didn't look welcoming. While the facilities themselves were nice, the space was a little awkward and the relaxation areas were not very appealing or attractive (compared to other high-end spas I have been to).

Extra paid services were excellent. The massage was very good, and the lovely sunroom was a great place to relax in the middle of winter. The massage room left like a little oasis with heated blankets and soft lighting.

The silent spa was worth the extra money. There are fewer people and more places to relax. The salt bath and warm rooms were great. Very much enjoyed my three hours there. Access came with a little cosmetic bag with salt for a foot bath, an apricot body scrub and a few other products to use in the spa. Note that not all guests followed the ""silent"" part of the spa and groups of women tended to be loud and not too considerate of others wishing to enjoy the quiet.

Our package included dinner which was a three course meal. The staff were attentive and helpful, offering extra bread and ensuring we knew everything that was included in our package (a glass of wine, and coffee or tea, etc.). The food was also very good. Beautifully presented and delicious, a lovely blend of flavours with little ""extras"" from the chef. I am glad that we booked early to make a reservation (staff recommended this when I made the booking) and that we were able to take our time and really enjoy this meal. Breakfast was also plentiful and included champagne!

Final note: children. This hotel provides a dedicated play area for kids and because of the size of the spa and lack of large pools, I saw no kids in the spa area. This made it so much more relaxing. Visits to other spas in the region have not been as restful.

This is a beautiful high-end spa and perfect for a weekend get-away. I would highly recommend it and would love to go again ... just know that this isn't going to be cheap. The hotel doesn't forget the extras and the staff will make you feel welcome and special.",January 2020,Hedon SPA & Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274956-d6570949-Reviews-Hedon_SPA_Hotel-Parnu_Parnu_County.html,"Parnu, Estonia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Fun - loved the decor!,"Dumplings! Lots of options and very authentic and delicious. I had a great lunch here of dumplings and tea. The portion, when served, looked small - but it was actually very filling. The dumplings are delicious and very very fresh.

The menu has some pictures to help make decisions.

Watching little old ladies rolling out dumplings as you come it adds to the fun atmosphere of this place!

I had borsch which was good and hearty, and the potato pancake which brought back memories of home cooking. The food was fast, came in generous portions and delicious.

The coffee was good, the croissants (when finally baked) were good. They are the frozen variety so not fresh made on site.

Insufficient infrastructure to support fans.,"While there literally isn't a bad seat in the arena, the internal infrastructure to support 9000 people is highly inadequate and the concourse areas become impassable during breaks.

I was here for the 2020 World Junior Hockey Championships and saw a lot of games, including double headers, so I now know my way around this arena well. The ""smaller"" nature of this arena makes it feel intimate and easy to connect with people which was fun, the limited areas to hang out also meant reconnecting with people day after day.

Entrances: There is a serious lack of proper line forming and some fans will push to the front. Perhaps a carrell would be more helpful and allow a more orderly screening process. I liked the separation of men and women in some lines which really speeded up the process, but over all the entrance created a major bottle neck. It was also totally hit and miss when there would be hundreds of people in line and when you would move through quickly. The second bottle neck occurred at the ticket scanners - there were just not enough for the number of people coming through (especially for the second game of the day).

Food: Was terrible, took forever and was often sold out before the start of the second game. I waited for 20 minutes in line for a burger to then be informed that it would take up to 40 more minutes for the burger to be ready. An hour for (what I was told) was a terrible burger? There was one sandwich concession which usually sold out quickly. If you can get food, it is reasonably priced, but in a venue where you cannot bring in your own food and people were watching back-to-back games and unable to get anything else, the concessions were totally inadequate. I had popcorn for dinner several nights because this was really my only option.

Drink: it was plentiful and cheap. This was done very very well. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options were easily available and usually dispensed quite quickly.

Space around the concourse: Often during a 15 minute period break it would take 5 minutes just to make my way out of the stands because the concourse areas was so packed. There just isn't enough space for people to line up for food, toilets and move around or go up and down the stairs from the arena to the concourse. The placement of the players dressing rooms also adds to the complication, making the back corner of the venue almost impossible to get into and out-of quickly.

Having said all this, the staff were generally friendly and I feel that they were trying their best to serve people. Security was also professional and tried to be as efficient as possible. Signage was good so it was easy to know where to go for specific seats.",December 2019,Ostravar Aréna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274719-d7598853-Reviews-Ostravar_Arena-Ostrava_Moravian_Silesian_Region_Moravia.html,"Ostrava, Czech Republic",attractions,3.0,4.0
Bisque staff and bland food,"We ate here because it was literally the only place open (other than KFC) on New Years Day. We were informed that there was a limited menu and that the pizza oven wasn't on. Understandable, it is New Years Day ...

The staff were not friendly or helpful, you could tell she didn't want to be there. When we went to order, almost everything we asked for was not on offer - at the end we basically had to ask her what was available. It looked like other tables had different options that what we were being offered.

The gnocchi was bland, greasy and had too much sauce.

"Good food, questionable hygine","Gokana was one of the few restaurants open between Christmas and New Year, and as a huge sushi fan, it was on my list of places to go.

I am going to start with the bad - the staff were all sick! Our waiter, who was very charming, was blowing his nose and sniffing, and then placing plates and food on our table. I also observed the chef at the sushi bar blow his nose and ""wash"" his hands (was a quick rinse) without soap and then wipe his hands dry on his pants. Consequently I have a cold now. I understand that it is probably hard to staff up during the holidays and lots of people are sick; but staff need to be more diligent about their hygiene (e.g.: wear a face mask to not breath on the food / wash hands properly / call in sick).

Now, the food was good, and the restaurant is cool, loved the vibe and the decor. Was lovely to have very good and fresh sushi - it did feel like eating in a nice restaurant in a major city. I did find it a little expensive for what it was though.

"Amazing jewellery, and a great day making my own Namejs ring!","This is a beautiful store with an amazing collection of hand crafted items with local and Latvian cultural / historical significance. It is hard to not spend money here!

But the main attraction is a hand made jewellery class where you can make your own Namejs ring! These must be pre-booked and pre-paid (with a minimum number of people) but are totally worth the trip to Sigulda.

The class is very hands on and goes through all the steps of making the ring, starting with a single rod of silver and finished in a beautiful and intricate ring. There were options in design as well, so not only did we all walk out wearing our new pieces, no two were alike! We had a few issues with misunderstandings due to language, but the shop, Master Jeweller and staff were accommodating, helpful and quick to fix things that were not perfect.

"Superb, and never fails to deliver a relaxing afternoon","This is my go-to place when I need some personal time and to relax. I also tell my friends or people visiting Riga that this is a great place to unwind after exploring and walking the city.

Upstairs Spa Area: Bright, even in the dead of winter which is nice. I love the ""private"" pods. These are small steam or sauna rooms, perfect for one to three people. This adds to the air of privacy and relaxation and I don't have to worry about strangers in my space. There is a lovely relaxation area with a fire, tea and water and an outdoor pool. I also like the cold showers and the large basin of ice to cool down with. This area never feels crowded, even on a Sunday afternoon. This place feels luxurious and I always feel pampered here.

Reception: The staff here are friendly (and very patient with my attempts to speak Latvian, even though they all speak perfect English). When they are busy, they always acknowledge me and say they will be with me as quickly as possible. They always ask if I know where I need to go and are helpful in showing me new things. Staff here are quick to accommodate and help if something isn't perfect.

Changing Rooms: I love the products in the showers, the lockers are large and the space is bright, clean and spacious. During weekends, it can get a little crowded (especially with the people using the gym or the active leisure pool on the 1st floor), but I have never had to wait to use a shower or had problems finding a locker.

Massage: I had a great massage with Sylvia. She was considerate and through. I loved being asked to sit and talk through which essential oil I wanted. Sylvia discussed with me if there were any spots I wanted worked on and checked in to ensure the pressure was good. The massage was relaxing and exactly what I needed. I have never been disappointed by a massage here (well ... I am always disappointed when it ends!) I also like that she switched up my robe at the end of my massage as my original one was wet.

Relaxation room: It is so hard to not nap here! The comfy chairs and the dim lights are the perfect way to just be after a good massage (or other treatment). Tea, light snacks and warm, dry robes make this a little oasis of quiet before having to deal with the real world.

Just a note; recently the outside pool has been a little colder than it used to be, which is disappointing and makes it hard to spend too much time outside. Perhaps the temperature can be adjusted?",December 2019,ESPA Riga,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274967-d1642641-Reviews-ESPA_Riga-Riga_Riga_Region.html,"Riga, Latvia",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Wow! Interesting, educational and more than I had hoped for","This company really knows how to host an amazing tour. Oleg was knowledgable and passionate about showing us lots of areas around the Exclusion Zone. I am not sure I can say enough about how good this tour was and how my expectations were exceeded. There is so much to see and experience - this is definitely a must see and SoloEast is definitely the group to see it with!

First; the van. It was clean, it was comfortable and every seat had a USB plug to charge our phones. On the way towards Chernobyl they played clips from the HBO series and other documentaries to give us an overview of the sites and reason for the explosion. The can was at the pick-up early so that, being cold outside, we could wait inside if we wanted to! Also the driver was great!

Second; the guide. Oleg was informative and honest. He let us know what was save and pointed out hot-spots (there are very few). He also gave us time to explore a little which was nice. We were running ahead of schedule so Oleg mixed up the itinerary giving us more time to see stuff (like the Russian Woodpecker).

Third; the time of year. Go in the late fall. There was no one there (well, almost no one) so it was easy to get pictures with no one in them, it was quite and the check-points were quick. Plus, since you have to be fully covered, cool weather means you are not overheating in long tops and pants. Finally, the damp air and leaves result in less dust in the air. Less leaves on the trees also means that you can see lots of the abandoned buildings along the roads and the views of the reactors are not obscured by trees. The tour is a little shorter because of the length of the day, but this is made up for because you are not waiting in line or competing with other people for the best photos.

Four; lunch. This is one of the few tours that includes lunch, which is really handy since you cannot eat outside. We had a good filling hot meal at the (only) restaurant in the old town of Chernobyl. This also means a stop to wash hands before eating and plumbing!

There is a lot to take in in one day and I would be tempted to go back and do the two-day tour. I am told you visit the same places but get to spend more time everywhere. Note that you are no longer allowed into the buildings - they are dangerous as they have had no maintenance in over 30 years.

This tour is brilliant. And it is safe. At no point was I fearful or worried about radiation. Oleg was great at explaining the risks and ensuring that we didn't touch or do anything that could endanger us!",December 2019,Chernobyl Tour from Kiev,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g294474-d11456482-Chernobyl_Tour_from_Kiev-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",activities,5.0,5.0
Almost a perfect spa weekend!,"First the good:
HOTEL: The hotel is clean, the staff are polite and friendly. I found the room lovely, loved how well lit it was, location of plugs (by the bed to charge phones over night). The bathroom was small, but really well laid out. There was lots of space and amenities in the room.

The bed was comfortable, but I found the pillows a little flat.

Also, the ability to access the spa after check-out is a lovely feature. And large lockers in the spa area made it possible to store our belongings while we used the facilities.

THE SPA: Lots of different saunas and hot tubs. Loved the salt room and layout / feel of the spa facilities. There is a pool-side bar with drinks for purchase, both healthy drinks and alcohol, and (free) water. Everything is well signed, clean and well thought out. Also loved the little towels provided outside each room to sit on.

Towels and dressing gowns were provided, along with soap / shampoo, and great lockers. Everything to just show-up with a swim-suit.

Now the bad:
THE SPA: Usually, when I go to a spa, it is to relax and unwind. This space is children friendly which makes it anything but relaxing for a couples retreat. Kids were ushered into sauna room screaming with no acknowledgement or apologies to people already in the space from the parents. In the steam room a group of boys (unaccompanied by parents) were using the seats as slides. When I made the booking, I had no idea that children would be in the spa.

During certain hours, sure - welcome children into the pool, but perhaps evenings should be reserved for adults who are looking for a relaxing experience. And perhaps children should have limited access (and maybe an age minimum) in some of the sauna / steam rooms.

I found the outside ""hot tubs"" way too cold. Nothing is more relaxing than soaking a hot jacuzzi tub while it is cold outside, this was a missed opportunity.

I don't think there was enough seating to relax between sauna / steam rooms. Around there pool were more seats that people in the pool ""reserved"" with towels - and this wasn't a relaxing place as the pool was filled with screaming children.

Final summary: I would stay here again and would make the most of the spa. I would try mid-week during the school year to avoid the number of children in the spa space.",November 2019,Estonia Resort Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274956-d602128-Reviews-Estonia_Resort_Hotel_Spa-Parnu_Parnu_County.html,"Parnu, Estonia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Bustling place for a great lunch,"This is obviously the place to be. It was full - but for good reason. The food was good, hot and served quickly. Staff were friendly and accommodating.

A nice place for a solo lunch or a long lazy meal with friends.",November 2019,Urbanity,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186605-d9976712-Reviews-Urbanity-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
