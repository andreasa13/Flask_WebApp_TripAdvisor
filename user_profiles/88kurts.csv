Good lobster burger. Poor service.,"Good lobster burger. Poor service. Manager and host were rude. Like all of Disney, but pricey. Convenient for Grand Floridian guests.",October 2020,Grand Floridian Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34515-d492959-Reviews-Grand_Floridian_Cafe-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Good food. Bit pricey.,"Enjoyed our time and had a very knowledgeable and king waiter in CJ. The main dish was great! Filet with potatoes and veggies. Just right. The tapas were tasty but small. Definitely good for one person. The dessert took forever. They messed up the chocolate cake but did it over again. Just took a long time. Overall, good experience.",May 2020,The Global Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34550-d664575-Reviews-The_Global_Grill-Pensacola_Florida.html,"Pensacola, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Ants in the room!,"Usually enjoy HIlton Garden, but was extremely disappointed when we awoke to ants crawling along the dusty headboard and along the nightstand.

Told the manager upon checkout, and he responded, “Oh, really?”

Won’t be back.",May 2020,Hilton Garden Inn Greenville,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g54258-d1515459-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Greenville-Greenville_South_Carolina.html,"Greenville, South Carolina",hotels,1.0,4.5
Awful service,Arrived 10 minutes early. Rude hostess. Table was ready. Made us seat in cold lobby after we requested to be seated and wait for the rest of our party. Ignored other guests while speaking to fellow employees. Good food though.,February 2020,The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Lynnwood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58578-d464047-Reviews-The_Keg_Steakhouse_Bar_Lynnwood-Lynnwood_Washington.html,"Lynnwood, Washington",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Horrible Value,"Food was mediocre. Service was awful, inattentive, and pushy. We ordered water to save a bit of money, and when they brought cheap bottled water, we thought, ""Oh well."" When the bill game, they charged almost the $5 per water bottle! Outrageous. Honestly the only reason people must go here is because of the location. STAY AWAY from this place.",December 2019,Air Margaritaville,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147320-d2444956-Reviews-Air_Margaritaville-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html,Puerto Rico,restaurants,1.0,3.0
Highly recommend!,"For me, the Shinkansen is a must do while in Japan! Not only was it a convenient, safe, clean, on-time, and *fast* option to get to Hiroshima from Kobe, it was a whole lot of fun. Honestly, it feels as if you're on a smooth airplane gliding on the ground. But unlike a flight above the clouds or too high to make out the details, the ability to drink in the scenery along the way is priceless.",November 2018,Tohoku Shinkansen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298237-d9595155-Reviews-Tohoku_Shinkansen-Tohoku.html,"Tohoku, Japan",attractions,5.0,4.0
Relax day in a hectic week,"Epcot is a diner's paradise! Whatever the type of food you want, you will find it at Epcot. It's interesting just to walk the loop and get a feel for the various cultures and matching decor. Epcot does offer a couple of rides (Soarin', Test Track, etc.), but is more known for the experience. The food choices are expensive--and obviously they have a captive audience--but overall the day can be a relaxing alternative to the ultra-busyness of Magic Kingdom or Universal. Check out which live shows are current to maximize the value of your visit.",October 2019,Epcot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34515-d126541-Reviews-Epcot-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.5
History and Views!,"What a great history lesson you will receive by opting for a guided tour of the Acropolis! As the very center of Greek culture, the acropolis provides not only the history of the Greek world empire and its religion, but also affords a panoramic view of literally all of the rest of Athens. You do not want to skip this. Those interested in the Bible will also want to see Mars Hill (Areopogas, just next to Acropolis), the site where the Apostle Paul spoke of the unknown god (Acts 17).",March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Incredible, iconic view!","Sydney harbour is the most iconic spot in Sydney and perhaps in all of Australia. You will love the beautiful walk along the harbour with all of the restaurant options, street performers. photo ops, and fresh sea air. Honestly, one could spent the entire day sipping coffee and enjoying the different vantage points.",July 2019,Sydney Harbour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d257842-Reviews-Sydney_Harbour-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,5.0,5.0
The very best way to see the city!,"We have found that the double-decker bus option is the first ""must do"" when you go to any new city. Stay on the bus for the entire trip and then decide where you want to hop on and off for future trips. It's well worth the price, and it will give you the most comprehensive understanding of the city in the shortest period of time.",March 2019,Roma Cristiana Hop On Hop Off Bus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d1403913-Reviews-Roma_Cristiana_Hop_On_Hop_Off_Bus-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,3.0
Best way to get around!,"Sydney is a wonderful city, but like most big cities is highly congested. The train system is clean, easy to navigate, completely safe, and affordable. It is especially convenient for those that stay outside of CBD (much cheaper) and come into the city to visit, shop, and sightsee.",July 2019,Sydney Trains,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d8130880-Reviews-Sydney_Trains-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,5.0,3.5
Beautiful and Quiet,"If you're looking for a pristine view of the Sea of Galilee without all the commercialism that tends to obscure the beauty, then this hotel is for you! It is clean, comfortable, and beer accommodating to groups! Everything seemed brand new, and the food was delicious!",April 2019,The Sea of Galilee Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1759678-d16694637-Reviews-The_Sea_of_Galilee_Hotel-Migdal_Galilee_Region_Northern_District.html,"Migdal, Israel",hotels,5.0,4.0
Substandard Service throughout,"My wife and I are frequent travelers, and we were looking forward to our time at Coronado Springs. The room was adequate, but not special in any way. The common areas outside the room were dirty.

How disappointed we were in the service though! The welcome team made the check-in process awkward and confusing. Then we received our bracelets to give us access to the rooms. Twice during our stay the bracelets needed to be replaced! The first time left my wife at the door to our room for 20 minutes trying to make the bracelet work, only to walk 15 minutes back to the front desk and 15 minutes back to the room. An hour wasted and not even an apology from the ""service"" team. The next day, the same things happened to me! Same result. We will do Disney again I'm sure, but I would stay away from Coronado Springs unless you want to add to your frustration.",October 2019,Disney's Coronado Springs Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34515-d120307-Reviews-Disney_s_Coronado_Springs_Resort-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",hotels,2.0,4.0
