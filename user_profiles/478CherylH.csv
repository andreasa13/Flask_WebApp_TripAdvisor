Good to visit,It is worth visiting the museum but have to dodge the tour groups as they stand right in front of all the exhibits making it difficult to read the history and information on them.,August 2018,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Great value for money,The food is fantastic and the trip was great value. The boat was older but still comfortable and took us to beautiful spots where the water was clear and the scenery spectacular. Lovely to have the Greek live music played on the return.

Food is excellent but felt like we were rush d,The food is fantastic and service great only thing is that they were packing our table up before we finished our wine.

Fantastic hotel,"Right from arrival the staff are simply fantastic. Nothing is any trouble for them. The rooms are comfortable and clean, the pool area and pool is beautiful, breakfast is awesome and the restaurant serves beautiful food. The only slight negative was that the bed was spongy due to a memory foam type layer on top of the mattress but it wasn’t so uncomfortable to complain. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk into town (we walked in for dinner and got a taxi home-€6) and a 30 minute walk to Kolymbithres beach. When we visit Naoussa again we will be sure to stay here!",August 2018,Saint Andrea Seaside Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g642170-d1500574-Reviews-Saint_Andrea_Seaside_Resort-Naoussa_Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Lunch with a view,Lovely lunch - can choose from Platter to a full menu. Food was gorgeous as was the wine and as for the view - magnificent. Really enjoyed our afternoon here,April 2018,Paulett Wines & Bush DeVine Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g8416546-d8571971-Reviews-Paulett_Wines_Bush_DeVine_Cafe-Polish_Hill_River_South_Australia.html,"Polish Hill River, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Need to clarify portions required,"Went with friends for a light tapas lunch (4 of us)- waitress said order 4 or 5 dishes and we will ensure enough for everyone. We ordered 5 dishes and out they came (food was lovely) what she failed to mention was that in ensuring we had enough food for everyone she was bringing out and charging us for 2 serves of each (so 10 dishes). I think she should have asked us whether we wanted 2 of each - so what was supposed to be a light lunch (as we had dinner out that night too) became a large lunch.

Sure we left feeling full but feeling like we had been duped too which was disappointing",April 2018,Mr. Mick,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g261645-d2520588-Reviews-Mr_Mick-Clare_South_Australia.html,"Clare, Australia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Fantastic as always,3rd visit here and can’t sing it’s praises high enough. Service is exceptional starting at the bar for a drink and following on into the restaurant.

Wonderful wines and venue,This is an awesome winery. If it is a nice sunny day go along and pick up some lunch items from the winery - they will put it in a basket- grab a bottle of their beautiful wine and sit outside in their funky but comfortable chairs and enjoy the hospitality for the afternoon. Hosts are fantastic- you feel like you are sat in their front lounge enjoying a glass of wine with them and having a chat. It really is one of my favourite wineries in Clare,April 2018,Shut the Gate Wines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g261645-d13457253-Reviews-Shut_the_Gate_Wines-Clare_South_Australia.html,"Clare, Australia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Awesome bar and atmosphere,"Great bar - second visit and will be a regular haunt when in Sydney.

Ok room but nothing special - served it purpose,"Room was ok, musty smell and hotel decor was peeling so needed updating. However it served its purpose as a one night stop over on way home.

Wedding Anniversary meal,"Had the discovery dinner menu with matching wines. All was beautifully presented and explained in full. The food was lovely as was the wines, only thing to note is you don't know the menu until after the event and so if you don't like certain foods it can detract from how nice the meal is as happened to me with 2 courses not eaten as the main ingredient (Fennel in one and Rhubarb in the other) are not to my taste. That been said it was a wonderful evening.",May 2017,Hentley Farm Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580499-d3203500-Reviews-Hentley_Farm_Restaurant-Seppeltsfield_Barossa_Valley_South_Australia.html,"Seppeltsfield, Australia",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Was somewhat underwhelmed,The farm shop was not what I expected. It certainly sells all the produce but I can get that at the local supermarket.

Tacky,"Fishermans wharf is an iconic tourist site in SF. It disappointed as was tacky, too touristy and for the UK travellers could be likened to Blackpool.

Fantastic value,"Stayed in 3 bed apartment in July. Was 5 of us, 2 adults and 3 teenagers. Apartment was fantastic, all facilities could want, close to shops, close to town and the ski bus stopped just down the road. Apartment was clean and comfortable with comfortable beds. Re cost it was one of the less expensive when I did research and so I rate it fantastic value for money. Only thing that could have improved was a second bathroom or toilet but we managed with the one.

"Great view, service and food variable","Looked nice, great views, were greeted cordially. Ordered meals and asked if meals came with veg. Told condescendingly that the meal was as written in menu.

After same waiter collected dishes, pointed out his error re meal came with veg. He told us that it didn't and we were wrong. Not sure where he was looking but veg was there!!
