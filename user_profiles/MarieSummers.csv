the place you must see,"A good thing that you cab see it from any engle. I found a spot on the hills nearby - amazing view on the Acropolis!

Cosy and tasty!,"I tend to visit restaurants with the recommendations. This old meze-restaurant was recommended by me Greek friends and it was a really nice choice.

Highly recommended.,"My friend and I had a very positive experience with a food tour made by Giorgos. We tried so many different things and learned fun facts about them (which is not possible to learn alone if you visit Greece just for a few days).

Giorgos was fun, energetic and very polite. He has so much knowladge in his field! Highly recommended.",July 2020,OPSON,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d21071271-Reviews-OPSON-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
