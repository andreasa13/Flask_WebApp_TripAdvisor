National Garden - Set the Peacocks Free,"We planned to walk through the park solely as a means to get from one point to the next, and were surprisedly pleased with the combination of well manicured paths and wildlife. The one negative has to do with the zoo, which admittedly speaks to a bit of a personal bias. The goats were in a pretty small enclosure, and even worse the peacocks were kept in a small space. In Madrid, the peacocks are free to roam around Parque de El Retiro, though they stayed in the spot that best met their needs. We would have preferred that they were offered the same freedom as the ducks, who have free access to the National Garden but stay around the pond.",February 2020,National Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d246658-Reviews-National_Garden-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Top rated Acropolis Museum,"Unlike larger, overwhelming museums where you end up exhausted and feeling that you somehow missed some good stuff, the Acropolis museum is manageable, fascinating, and well located in the shadows of the actual Acropolis. Take the 15 minutes to watch the film on the top floor, and definitely check out the excavation site beneath. Warning: Your admission ticket lets you into both the museum and excavation site separately, but can be used only once for each. So don’t enter the museum if you really want to see the excavation first (like we did).",February 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Best view of Athens, Mount Lycabettus","Despite having made peace with missing Mount Lycabettus this trip, we found ourselves walking around it’s base on the way back from lunch in Exarcheia and thought, why not?! We took the funicular slowly up through a dark tunnel and stepped out essentially into a cafe. Spectacular 360 view, good cafe options both food and drink, and even a feisty cat. Easy trip, needs no more than 90 minutes, but definitely stay longer to take in the view from the cafe. Glad not to have missed it!",February 2020,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Avocado, nice vegetarian spot in Athens","Usually I do not over-order, and I gravitate towards appetizers. So I was surprised when the waitress warned me that the falafel appetizer plus the avocado burger might be too much. And, when the burger arrived, I understood. Way bigger than my mouth, but I would not be defeated. I loved that it is all vegetarian and has a mission of peace and love. And the ambience, especially the upstairs seating on low cushions, was relaxing. Definitely worth a try, we enjoyed it.",February 2020,Avocado,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2155243-Reviews-Avocado-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Safety in numbers - Istiklal Street,"Immediately after arriving in Istanbul, we encountered a young shoe shiner who “dropped” his brush as he walked past us. We, of course, pointed this out to him and he, in return, thanked us profusely and insisted on giving a “free” shoeshine (for my worn out hiking shoes). We said thank but no thanks and had to essentially run away from him to get him to leave us alone, after which we continued along in the dark through strange and unknown streets to our AirBnB. A bit shaken already, we looked up “scams in Istanbul” and suddenly felt very unsafe. From pickpockets to excessive drink ordering schemes to some very scary and aggressive assaults, Istanbul seemed like an unfriendly place. The next day, with the morning sun providing some hope, we ventured out and soon came upon Istiklal Street. While our guard remained up, the sight of fellow tourists on a wide street with a trolley car calmed our nerves, and allowed us to enjoy the rest of our stay. Istanbul, you are alright in our book!",February 2020,Istiklal Caddesi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293974-d295195-Reviews-Istiklal_Caddesi-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",attractions,4.0,4.0
"Tahin Karaköy, simple and yummy","This relatively simple restaurant in the vibrant neighborhood of Karaköy checked the boxes. Good food, quick service, and simple atmosphere. It was not overly “special” in terms of being a unique Turkish experience, hence only 4 out of 5. That said, my wife and I ate very well for under $15USD total.

"Neat, but underwhelming","It has its moments, but felt more utilitarian than beautiful. The exterior was more impressive than the interior. The floor was carpeted with red carpet, so shoes are forbidden. And columns are not all stone, many seem dry walled. Certainly more of a working mosque than a tourist attraction. That said, it’s right near other must see spots, so should be experienced.",February 2020,Blue Mosque,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293974-d294495-Reviews-Blue_Mosque-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",attractions,3.0,4.5
Perfect Turkish breakfast,"As vegetarians who struggle a bit with gluten, we had some anxiety about meals in Istanbul. After reading reviews, we chose Arada Cafe. We had to wait around 30 minutes for our table to be ready (did not make a reservation, not sure if they take them). Definitely worth the wait. They require that patrons order the standard breakfast, with the option of adding items. It included all the must haves, with delicious bread (yes, we had gluten, and it was worth it!) The only add on we purchased was Turkish coffee, as endless tea refills were included. In all, we paid $24USD for a lovely meal with great ambience. Highly recommended!",February 2020,Arada Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d7360620-Reviews-Arada_Cafe-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Ancient Agora, unexpected highlight","We expected this to be a simple walkthrough, like some of the other sites.

"Amazing Acropolis, a unique experience","It is hard to believe that something with so much history is still around to be seen up close. Breathtaking.

Random Find in Narrowsburgh,"On a seldom traveled road behind the Main Street in Narrowsburgh, we happened upon this perfect riverside restaurant.

Walkway underwhelming,"After Google Maps decided to take me on a creative detour, we embarked over the walkway.

"Delicious, our #1 take-out option","We stayed in Barcelona for one week and had take-out from Bembi three times. We are vegetarians who seem to gravitate towards Indian food as our go-to cuisine when traveling. While I cannot speak the experience of dining in, I can say that the reception I received was first class, they spoke fluent English (helpful for a non Spanish speaking tourist), had a comfortable space for me to wait for food to be prepared, and above all make delicious food. The second time I visited in three days the owner/staff greeted me by name (ok, so she tried to but got the name wrong), and treated me like I was a long time friend of the restaurant. I felt welcomed, and appreciated the warmth.

"Luxury, welcome oasis from chaos!","As an American in India, it took some getting used to the constant movement. Even as I discerned patterns in the chaos over the period of a week, it remained exhausting. The Leela Palace was the calm in the eye of the storm that allowed me and my wife to regroup in quiet, pampered relaxation. All amenities are perfect, from the afternoon tea in the beautiful lounge to the half dozen restaurants to the exceptional breakfast looking out upon the inspiring garden. The staff is helpful and polite. It is not within walking distance of most things (Delhi is really not a walking city), but there are auto-rickshaws waiting across the street, Uber drivers get there in minutes, and cabs are plenty. Spend the extra money on this, it will greatly improve your experience in Delhi.",March 2016,The Leela Palace New Delhi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304551-d1759051-Reviews-The_Leela_Palace_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,"New Delhi, India",hotels,5.0,5.0
"It's what you would expect, and worth it","Yes, it is a very large Buddha sitting in a square. What did you expect. Surrounded by some structures, with a shop and restroom near.

Trying to see Mt Fuji?,"We were on a mission. Rented bikes and rode for 25 minutes up the coast. And lo and behold, we actually DID see the great mountain. It is imposing and amazing. But since it is still far away and the air was hazy, our cameras did not quite capture it. But we know it is possible, we have seen other photos.

Such cool stuff,"The street is busy, and the shops offer a cool variety of unnecessary but really neat stuff. We spent 3,000 yen on three wall hangings. Now we just need frames!

Meiji Jingu stroll,"After spending a few days in Nara and Kyoto, I opted to spend the last couple days in bustling Tokyo. But...one more shrine couldn't hurt, right? Well, glad I made the effort. The walk to the center of the park on wide but peaceful paths gave some time to clear the mind.

Bright lights of Shibuya,"I really do not like shopping. But...my wife does. And, as a New York City dweller who steers clear of Times Square, I admit I was curious. So I went and, much to my surprise, enjoyed the atmosphere. Yes, lots of people and lights everywhere, but the shops were clean, the energy was positive, and the selections were great.

Harajuku experience,"I only heard about it the day before when made aware of a Gwen Stefani song about the Harajuku girls. They are their own fashion trend, with almost doll like, playful clothing. Well, I did not see many girls running down the block fitting that description in my 30 minute walk down the block, but I did find many adorable shops selling clothing and candy. I almost bought a back back that I'm sure would have looked ridiculous on me. But I guess that's the peer pressure of the block. If anywhere near there, make sure to walk that path.

Park Guell - be warned,"The park is amazing, well worth the trip. The warning is related to planning ahead. They only let a certain number of people in at at time to minimize the crowd, so when you buy a ticket it is for a specific entry time, like 11:00. Perhaps it was the time of year we visited (late December), but trying to buy a ticket early enough to enjoy the light (sunset around 17:00) was impossible at the onsite ticket office.

La Pedrera day and night,"So cool we had to do it twice! Although it seemed expensive, we opted for the day/night package. Includes a daytime tour of the grounds, attic, quarters, and lobby. About 45 minutes or so. Pretty funky structure. At night, after dark, the second part of the experience also includes a tour, literally topped off by a light show on the roof.
