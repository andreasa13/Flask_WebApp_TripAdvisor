AHHHHHMalfi Coast!,"Our driver was Bruno Lazzaro, amazing! The Amalfi Coast is beautiful, we loved every inch of what we saw. Positano, Sorrento, Pompeii can't wait to return and spend more time in these places, and see more of what the coast has to offer. Great service worth every penny! If you are doing a cruise don't sign-up for one of those expensive shore excursions that show you what they want you to see and you are on their time schedule, book with these guys and have a great experience!",October 2019,A coastal experience - Amalfi Coast tour -,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187785-d16796221-A_coastal_experience_Amalfi_Coast_tour-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",activities,5.0,5.0
