variety items.,"we came here early in the morning, almost 830am in the morning if im not mistaken. many shops are still not open yet. so we were walking for about 30 minutes only. we were looking at book stall but we didnt understands as the books is written in greek. so we didnt understand even a word and just pass by. we planned to buy crepe but the shop is not ready yet. so we just continue walking the market. btw for me its quite scary to be in this flea market . i dont know why but we were felt unsafe. is it because we were all females traveller and wearing hijab. but yes you need to be extra careful everywhere :)",March 2019,Flea Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1574024-d6429024-Reviews-Flea_Market-Monastiraki_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Monastiraki, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.5
