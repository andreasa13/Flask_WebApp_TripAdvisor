Great hotel value,Great hotel with roof top restaurant that was nice for breakfast and evening cocktails. The view of the city and the Acropolis was amazing especially when it was lit up at night. The area within a few blocks of the hotel wasn’t the best but you could easily take a taxi or the blue line hop on and off tour bus ( 16 euros for 2 day pass) anywhere in the city. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were nice and clean. Very good value.,March 2019,Wyndham Grand Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d10961869-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Amazing experience,One of a kind experience. There were no lines today and it was easy to get around and take pictures. We got a two day pass on the blue line and rode the bus to the Acropolis and other sites. It was well worth 16 euros. We did not need a tour guide especially because it is not always easy to understand the locals.,March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Vacation,"We had a wonderful experience at the Mono restaurant. The food was EXCELLENT, the staff was very attentive and patient with our atypical requests and the decor made it an inviting environment.",March 2019,Mono Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2275336-Reviews-Mono_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent Adventure,I traveled with a group of friends and we all enjoyed the friendly staff and clean hotel. The views from the rooms and the restaurants were unbelievable. I was not aware of the shortage of US dollars in the country and I never imagined that you could not get money out of the ATM machines not even at the airport. I was able to use my visa card in most situations but if I had more money I could have left better tips.,March 2018,Victoria Falls Safari Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293761-d3419807-Reviews-Victoria_Falls_Safari_Club-Victoria_Falls_Matabeleland_North_Province.html,"Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe",hotels,5.0,5.0
