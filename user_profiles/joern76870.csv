Nice Location direct at the Marina,"The Barong is located direct at the waterfront of Zea Marina in Pireas. It is really nice to sit and sea the sailing boats.

Amazing and impressing location,"To visit the Acropolis is really mandatory to be at this ancient location. The entrance fee is 20€ but for kids it is free. I you need a guide you can them near the ticket office.

Very nice charming hotel in the City Center,"The Kimon Hotel is located about 400 m from Syntagma Sq in a side street. To this Plaka it is just 200 m.
The hotel is small but very charming. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel offers no breakfast but in distance of 50 m you can find a nice tavern. The hotel has no elevator what is a real challenge when you get a room in third floor and you have heavy luggage.
The roof garden with Acropolis view is very nice. The hotel is very nice to explore Athens.",October 2020,Kimon Athens Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d13656593-Reviews-Kimon_Athens_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,3.5
