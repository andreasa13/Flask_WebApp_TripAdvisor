Pricey but tasty,This was my 2nd visit. The service was slow this time must have been a busy night. My Calzone was huge and tasty. My friend however got one of the Chef's recommendation and although it was tasty the price was high because the dish was too include shrimp however they cut the shrimp in half to make it appear there are more shrimps for the price of almost 16 Euro. I also was a little disturbed because after the people left that was sitting near us and staff cleared the table I didn't see anything wiped down or cleaned with disinfectant or just water. This probably wouldn't bother me as much but during this COVID time I thought this was a requirement for all restaurants.,August 2020,Taormina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635858-d2043604-Reviews-Taormina-Landstuhl_Rhineland_Palatinate.html,"Landstuhl, Germany",restaurants,4.0,4.0
