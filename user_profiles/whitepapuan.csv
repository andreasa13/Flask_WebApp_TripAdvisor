"Great Tour, will always recommend!","English George was an experienced, funny and courteous guide who showed us the Area around the Acropolis.

Cozy and quiet.,"Beautiful quiet restaurant with really friendly staff...
Not pricey at all, cheaper than the neighbouring restaurants and you get the same specialities of prague.
Sitting outside was very relaxing and cozy. Really loved sitting outside.",August 2016,Restaurace U Zlateho Precliku,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d1746700-Reviews-Restaurace_U_Zlateho_Precliku-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Worst hotel experience in my life!,"I have never experienced such bad service in my entire life! We checked in, already paid for a two-room villa and then after only 30 minutes, finding all the hidden maintenence errors (couldn't lock the door, air conditioner wasn't working, TV were bad quality, sinks didn't work etc.) We decided to move rooms. We found out everything else was booked, so then wanted to move hotels. When we told them we wanted our money back, suddenly they did have two free rooms...!!! We then got mad at them for telling us and then for sure wanted our money back! They wasted 2 hours of our time, we didn't get our money back. For 30minutes in a villa, we had to pay $150. Worst hotel experience ever.",January 2014,Batu Suki Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297710-d3914274-Reviews-Batu_Suki_Resort-Malang_East_Java_Java.html,"Malang, Indonesia",hotels,1.0,2.0
