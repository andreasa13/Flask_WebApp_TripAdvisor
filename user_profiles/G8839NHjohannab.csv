"About prices!!! Very expensive, even if you're a student in Greece (or anywhere)","The Acropolis itself is beautiful - at least from the outside. That's all I can say.
Be CAREFUL all STUDENTS! NO DISCOUNT.
If you're under 25 you're lucky, - student or not.
And to the rule-makers: I would love to understand the logic of how a full time student (in Greece) over 25 has more money (to afford a pretty expensive entrance) than a under 25 year old person with a full time job and full salery. And in your opinion the student must have a lot more money than the under 25 years old person with a full salery because there isn't even a discount. Why do you think that? It would at least help for my disappointment to understand that.",July 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5
Overall great experience - very friendly,"Since most of my holidays are riding holidays (in Scandinavia) I needed at keadt one Rome riding in my romeo Lesvos. I felt very welcome here at Ippos and had a great time all over. Even though I'm almost only used to little icelandic horses I got a very nice and easy-going mare to ride - she made my big-horse experience (only one of very very few) a great one. So it was a very enjoyable ride :)
Thank you for everything! Hopefully see you again for a repetition at some point. :)",June 2020,Ippos Horse Riding and Excursions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1191013-d4888545-Reviews-Ippos_Horse_Riding_and_Excursions-Molyvos_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
