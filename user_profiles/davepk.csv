Good food very slow service,"Went for our first pub garden lunch since lockdown , food was good but service was very slow , had to wait a very long time to get our drinks ( I had to remind the two girls serving twice ) .

Hotel in great location,"Very modern hotel that is in a great location . Hotel is very clean and staff very friendly . The free breakfast is very nice but would be a bit boring if you stayed there any longer than a week . Room are a bit on the small size but beds are really comfy and we all had a great nights sleep . Bathroom is nice but has a frosted glass to the bedroom which if someone showers and are right up against the glass isn't the greatest for privacy . One WARNING be careful of the bell hops. We enquired how much a cab would be to JFK. The bell hop pushed us to get a car organised by him as it would be cheaper. We were quoted $75 and informed this included all tips, tolls etc. We clarified this by asking did this include the tip for driver and we were told yes. I noted that the receipt I was given said ""gratuities not included"". I went back again to check and he insisted that it did. His actual words were ""trust me"". I was totally embarrassed when I got to JFK. I handed over the money. The driver counted it and said ""I guess you were not happy with the service today"". I explained what I was told but could tell that he was not happy. He was very diplomatic but none the less I felt embarrassed. This kind of soured an otherwise really nice vacation in the big Apple .By the way yellow cabs offer a flat rate of around 65 dollars to JFK plus tip so if I was you that's the way I would go do not trust what the hotel bell hops tell you .",March 2019,Hotel Riu Plaza New York Times Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d8515751-Reviews-Hotel_Riu_Plaza_New_York_Times_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,4.0,4.5

The breakfast looked too good to eat and tasted delicious!! We were very impressed as by the time we were finished breakfast and went back to our room it had already been serviced.

Expert guides,"This is a must see , these ancient indian ruins and pictograms are well preserved and the guides here are very knowledgable. I would definetely visit these ruins via dry creek road as not only do you get great views of boynton canyon but the trail road is not as bumpy as the alternate route the fr525 . Beware in June ,July ,August there might be a possibility that ruins will not be accessible close up please check when making your reservation as journey there would not be worth the view .",March 2014,Palatki Ruins,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g31352-d591300-Reviews-Palatki_Ruins-Sedona_Arizona.html,"Sedona, Arizona",attractions,5.0,4.5
