SKIP and head over to Diva Pizza,"My friend and I made a beeline for this place after complaining to a friend that we haven't found good in Athens since having arrived 3 days earlier. She had recommended Piadina Lumbro because her friends, who are locals, took her here during her visit. Based on those two facts, my friend and I had high hopes for this place.

We both ordered the Margherita Pizza each. When it arrived, the presentation was there; it was a piping hot, thin crust pizza. However, after the first bite we both looked at each other and said, ""Why is it bland?!"" It literally tasted like nothing. I knew I was eating bread with cheese and sauce but I didn't taste it. I get it, I'm from NYC; it's difficult to compete with NYC pizza. But after 3 days of bland food in Athens, all we wanted was some. kind. of. FLAVOR.

My friend then asked for garlic powder but we were face with a language barrier. As anyone else would, she googled the term and showed it to the waitress and cook. They both had the Eureka moment but then wrongly assumed that we wanted chopped garlic! So my friend pointed to the salt shaker and said, ""Powder."" And she was met with, ""Ohhhh. No!"" To make matters worse, as soon as my friend walked away, the waitress and cook started laughing! I guess bland pizza would be funny to me too if my friend and I haven't been met with disappointment upon disappointment when it comes to food in Athens.

I say SKIP THIS PLACE. If you want pizza or food with FLAVOR, head over to Diva Pizza. Better service and even better food!",March 2020,Piadina Lumbro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d13385532-Reviews-Piadina_Lumbro-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
I would come back to Athens just for this!,"WOW. I don't even know where to begin.

This place is an oasis in a sea of tourists. Upon stepping over the threshold, I was engulfed in calm. The space is serene in every detail, from the tasteful decor to the attentive staff. It's also very, very clean. All members of the staff wear Crocs, similar to doctors and nurses. In addition, visitors are asked to wear shoe covers before they enter the changing area. The shoe covers are soon replaced by terry cloth slippers after visitors change out of street clothes.

The changing area is just as sterile and tastefully decorated as the reception area. Each visitor receives their own locker stocked with a bathrobe, terry cloth slippers, and undies (should you choose to change out of your own).

Re: quality of the service...I originally signed up for the bamboo massage but since they weren't offering it at this time, I opted for the 90 minute hot stone instead. I won't bore you with the details of the treatment but I will say that I have never ever EVER felt more relaxed in my entire life! (If I had this treatment once a week, I would be a completely different person.)

After 15 minutes on the massage table, I noticed that my breathing became less and less shallow. Enter relaxation and calm. As a native New Yorker, I am never relaxed; I am always ready to attack the next ""to do"" on my list. Relaxing during vacation is perpetually on my wishlist. Thanks to Old City Hamam & Spa, I am finally RELAXED. So much so that before I left, I booked the same treatment for my last full day in Athens.

Thanks so much for everything!",March 2020,Old City Hamam & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d14087864-Reviews-Old_City_Hamam_Spa-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
YUMMY!,"Finally!!! We found a tasty place to eat in Athens. It has taken over 4 days to find a place that has flavors upon flavors. Before finding this haven, all we found was bland food, if not horrible. Our craving for Italian food became that much more immediate because of it.

Then enters Diva Pizza. Their Tartufo Pizza is out of this world! I was soooo STUFFED but I couldn't stop eating. The pizza was that good! It was fortunate that we had a 20 minute walk back to the AirBnB to help me walk it off.

Kudos to the classic touches like gazpacho soup before our meal and limoncello ice after dinner.

Lastly, the service was great! We were given adequate time to order, and more importantly, we enjoyed our meal in peace.

Thank you so much, Diva Pizza. You will be hearing from us again soon! If not in person, we will be ordering takeout during our time in Athens.",March 2020,Diva Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2155324-Reviews-Diva_Pizza-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
It's not that bad...,"I had read the previous reviews as my friend and I sat in the cafe ""Skybar"". I was mortified at what I saw! But after having sat there for 2 hours, it wasn't bad. We both had 2 glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon each at 6EU for each glass. I didn't think that was terribly overpriced. The food menu is limited but after finding Greek food to be bland, we decided to save our calories for drinking. The waiters did bring peanuts to the table, along with our glasses of wine, which was nice.

Overall, my friend and I didn't experience any rudeness from the staff. My friend and I were taken aback when the waiter told us that he would like to close us out since there was a shift change but it wasn't so farfetched that it took away from our experience lol. My friend and I were both appreciative that despite only having 4 glasses of wine total in two hours, we weren't rushed out of the place. They are very accommodating of people who just wanted to relax and enjoy the views. (There were plenty of people who were there before us and who stayed after us who didn't have anything at their table.)

All in all, I would say, go and enjoy. Have a drink. Skip the food.",March 2020,Cafe Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4097679-Reviews-Cafe_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Great trek to the top!,"From the base of the hill, it took us about 20 mins to walk to the top. It wasn't a steep incline but more gradual. I didn't find it strenuous, but I definitely broke a sweat. I wasn't taking a stroll; I was walking to get to the stop.

I would NOT recommend bringing little kids on the walk/hike. There are ZERO safety precautions from the edge. Even if a tree or bush broke one's fall, it will hurt very very much and will more than likely cause permanent injury.

The views on the walk up were pretty spectacular! It was a clear and sunny day and one could see all the way to the Acropolis and beyond. In general, the hill provides a 360 degree view of Athens.

A LOT of people watch the sunset from Lycabettus Hill but I didn't think it was that great. I was expecting a show stopper and for some reason the sun's colors were hidden by clouds. Not sure how that works since visibility was all the way to the sea.

Re: dress...I had on sneakers, loose pants, and a tank top and I was sweating as I trekked up the winding hill. Once we sat at the cafe at the top, it got really windy. Thank goodness I had my scarf to wrap around my upper body! Otherwise, I would have been miserable. The wind at the top is very unforgiving.",March 2020,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Why wouldn't you?,"Not sure why people would come to Athens and not bother with the Acropolis, unless they've seen it before. It truly is a marvel! I only wish that the construction was a lot further along so that I can see more of its previous splendor. However, what's left of it is still cool to see and experience.

I didn't research the venue before my visit but because of how truly great the structures were, it encouraged me to educate myself on the subject afterward. It made me wonder why the restoration was taking so long; why the roofs have all blown off; what the space was originally used for; and the list goes on.

As one of the main attractions of Athens, it makes me wonder why it closes so early (3pm). Even if it's for safety reasons (the grounds are very uneven), surely they can extend hours to 5pm. NOTE: My friend and I got there at 8am and had the place to ourselves for a solid hour until all the tour groups started coming in in droves.

If history or architecture is not your thing but you were dragged to the Acropolis by family, then at least enjoy the 360 degree view of Athens.",March 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Godsend,"It it wasn't for this bakery, I would be starving during my vacation in Athens. Not only is everything yummy, but they are made daily on the premises. If you come in before 8am, you will see condensation on the display case since the baked goods have literally just come out of the oven.

I would also like to commend the people who work here. They are always friendly and upbeat. There is a woman in particular, who is probably one of the kindest souls I've come across in my travels. She's the type of person who really enjoys what she does for a living.

Free Guided Tour!!,"I didn’t even know about the free tours until I started researching the Greek National Opera. During my last trip to Europe I really enjoyed the tour at the Vienna Opera House and was looking for a similar experience in Athens. Come to find out the cultural complex houses two of my favorites - an opera house and a beautiful library.

I’m so grateful to have stumbled on the information. I’m even more grateful that I got to take advantage of the tour. My group was a total of six; the cap is 25. The website wasn’t clear about the meeting point - “Public PC Lobby”. I popped in the library prior to the tour and double checked with one of the security guards where the meeting point was located. (PC = Personal Computer.) If you head in the direction of the ground floor public “computer lab”, you’ll see an information desk before you get to the computers.

You’ll have to check in at the desk for the free tour. The person behind the desk will then confirm your online reservation and you’ll be handed a badge to wear for the duration of the tour.

The tour consists of the ground floor of the library, as well as the 2nd floor, which had limited access since it was Clean Monday. The tour continues to the Greek National Opera afterwards. Again, we started at the ground floor. After comparing both lobbies, library and opera, we were guided to one of the smaller stages, where it was being prepped to debut a show. We headed to the main stage soon after. Both stages were very intimate and contemporary.

We also got to see two rehearsal studios. One of them actually had a member of the orchestra. He was practicing but didn’t mind our brief interruption. We were also granted access to the 5th floor of the main stage, where we came to appreciate that even the “cheap seats” had great views of the stage!

We wrapped up the tour at The Lighthouse, where our guide continued to educate us on the sustainability practice of the complex.

The 90 minute tour was worth every second. So glad there were only six of us! Otherwise, we would have lost too much time just trying to corral everyone.

Thanks again for such a great tour! I wish everyone was as generous as SFNCC.",March 2020,Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g262046-d10494339-Reviews-Stavros_Niarchos_Foundation_Cultural_Centre-Kallithea_Attica.html,"Kallithea, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Thank you, Max for ruining my bday dinner. THANK YOU.","I mistakenly chose Max to celebrate my birthday with five of my girl squad. This is based on our past experience at their original location around the corner. Hard. Lesson. Learned.

My girl friends were there at 5pm racking up a tab at the bar since our reservations were at 6pm. I strolled in at 6:30 just after appetizers arrived. As a New Yorker, we all know 6pm is EARLY for dinner and sure enough, the restaurant was half empty when I arrived. Our waiter was nice enough, but I noticed that he was rushing us to order. Fine. We ordered. Our plates literally came out five minutes later! If you know Max, their claim to fame is that food is fresh and made to order. But five minutes? Seriously?

By the time our dinner arrived, it was around 6:55. I know because the table next to us started filling up. In fact, one of girls at the table was oblivious to how close the tables were from each other that her butt knocked my entire glass of water into my lap! So yes, I was very much aware of time.

After that debacle, I kept a close eye on the other table afraid they would knock my wine over too! Max definitely overbooked because there were six girls at a table for four. Violation, much? Let’s just say if there was a fire, I would have burned since there was no clear path for me to exit my seat, let alone the restaurant.

But that’s not the icing on my rotten birthday cake. After I had only taken four bites of my dinner, two bites of soapy-tasting spaghetti and two bites of bland eggplant parmesan, the manager (55-yr old, long stringy blond hair, and oversized black-rimmed glasses) took our plates away. She didn’t ask, “Are you finished?” Instead, she asked, “Would you like that wrapped?” Um, sure lady. Thanks.

After the manager came back with my dinner-to-go, my girl friends and I inquired about dessert. She verbally delivered the dessert menu, started taking our orders and then said, “To be honest, I can’t serve you dessert because you were late.” Ex-squeeze me?! My girl friends were quick to remind her that they had been at the bar since 5pm! The manager retorts, “Exactly! That’s why you were late!” We then asked for the check and as we waited, she continued to argue with us about why we were rushed our of the restaurant. I have so many words re: the manager’s IQ level and lack of business acumen, but I will spare you, dear reader.

All you have to know is that Max Tribeca is done. It’s not the same and it shall never be. The food is bland at best, and the service? The manager working on Feb 11, 2020 needs to be let go. Even by NY standards, she’s a vile and toxic person who should not be anywhere near the service industry.

Please spare yourselves the trouble and go elsewhere. It was 7:25pm when my girl friends and I headed over to Primo’s for cocktails and dessert. As their name implies, the service was primo! Max could learn something from Primo’s. Or Max can spare us all and just close shop.",February 2020,Max,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d874212-Reviews-Max-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,1.0,4.0

Definitely NOT a Big Chain Theater,"As a New Yorker, I know I need to manage my expectations outside the city but if I were to describe this theater in one word, it would be INEFFICIENT. The design of the lobby/concession area is an abomination. Rounding the corner from the “ticket stand”, you have two options - cashier stand straight ahead OR food to your right. Instincts would tell you that you should choose food prior to heading to the concession stand. The answer to the that question is actually quite complicated. And there are NO SIGNAGE to assist you on your quest. Actually, I stand corrected. There’s a 4 x 5 sign in front of the cashier (because that’s helpful).

My nieces and I made the mistake of trying to order at the snack stand but was told we were to proceed to the cashier stand. While waiting at the cashier stand, my niece realized that we had to grab the popcorn from the concession stand before proceeding to the cashier stand to place our non-popcorn food order. Confused? Wait until you experience it for yourself!

And the icing on this rotten cake is the wait times for the non-popcorn food order. Short order cooks, they are not. Not even close! We waited 20 mins for (2) orders of chicken fingers and fries. Based on my observation of the safety hazard “waiting area”, this is typical of every order.

When we finally got to our seats, my reclining chair screamed every time I adjusted (Theater 4, Seat A1). And forget using the tray! It was broken. The tray was ready to fall into my lap any second.

I try to support mom and pop shops, I do, but this theater has to do better.

NO! NO! NOOOOO!,"NOTE: Austrian Airlines is owned by Lufthansa.

I have had so many problems with Lufthansa as of late that I feel compelled to warn other consumers.

The first incident involves my trip to Vienna 11/28-12/8. Lufthansa’s app has not been updated to include TSA Precheck since joining other airlines this past August so I was forced to wait at the airport kiosk the day before Thanksgiving. I stood in line for 10 mins only to be told my a RUDE Lufthansa employee that Austrian Airlines is not part of TSA Precheck. I didn’t have the energy to advise that she check the TSA website where it confirms that both Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines participate in TSA Precheck.

Train your employees, Lufthansa. Seriously.

On my return from Vienna, I was racially profiled at the Vienna airport. I was flagged by an Austrian Airlines employee to weigh my TSA approved carry-on. This is in the midst of other travelers who weren’t harassed simply because of the color of their skin. (If you were to google racially profiling at Vienna airport, you would be surprised at the numbers of incidents.). The limit was 8 kg and my luggage weighed 11 kg so I was forced to pay 55 euros and check in my luggage.

The third incident has to do with my trip to Athens this coming February. Due to the 6-10 day lag in posting to my credit card, I booked the same ticket twice. (I feared that the first ticket purchase didn’t go through since I never received a booking confirmation.)

However, the lag is attributed to Lufthansa’s software. Did I get a credit for the duplicate? NO. Have I been trying to remediate the issue with Lufthansa for TWO months? YES. The ironic part is everyone on Lufthansa’s team knows that Lufthansa posts to credit cards after 6-10 lag.

Moral of the Story: In this day and age, everyone deserves to spend their money on companies who actually try to provide a service. Lufthansa/Austrian Airlines is NOT one of them. Not only are they RUDE, but there is no communication between departments. You are better off booking with another airline.

Keep It Moving!,"After mining the Christmas Markets for non-sausage foods, I was starving! So when I got to my AirBnB and saw that this place was still open at 7pm, it was a godsend. Or was it?

SERVICE. I waited patiently as the older gentleman (owner?) chatted it up with a woman in front of me. I can only deduce that she’s a local. She kept looking at me as if apologizing for the conversation but the owner/worker bee just kept chatting. I get it; they’re probably old friends. (He certainly gave her a discount.) Finally, he bagged up her goodies and sent her on her way. She then stopped 2ft to chat up another patron, who also knew the owner/worker bee.

When the owner/worker bee took my order, he was barely paying attention. Not even a friendly chatter. I got a four-cheese sandwich and two raisin cookies. Did I get a bag? Nope! He didn’t even hand my food to me. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough!

FOOD QUALITY. Meh. The four cheese combo in the grilled cheese should be questioned; it didn’t taste right. At one point, I looked if there was a fried egg in it. Also the raisin cookies were dry and if it wasn’t for the raisins, it tasted like sugary dust.

WOW!,"I was super excited to visit this library based on the photos I saw online. However, once I got there I waited 10 mins outside before I got the courage to go in. The reviews weren’t clear on access requirements and I didn’t want to be the stereotypical stupid American haha.

I entered via Reviczky u through 3 pairs of doors before you get to the information desk - wooden doors, glass sliding doors, wooden doors. The lady at the desk spoke little English but she understood me enough to know why I was there. The cost to enter is 1000 HUF, or approximately $3.31.

Once you pay the fee, you have to go through security turnstiles. Since I didn’t have a card, I had to ask a couple of ladies at the information desk (closest to the turnstiles) how to go in. One of them took me through the red rope. I think normally I would have had to deposit my things in the locker room but it was close to 7pm and they closed at 8pm.

Anyway, I quickly headed to the 4th floor soon after. After stepping off the elevator, head to your left. The old smoking room is in the very back; there are signs indicating “Palace”. Before I got there, I passed the reading room which was breathtaking. I actually sat in an alcove for 20 mins as I read about the history of the library. Then I quietly headed to the old smoking room which is something out of a movie! I sat in the room quietly as I looked around.

Honestly, the palace side of the 4th floor is enchanting. I would have taken photos but I didn’t want to be a jerk since there were so many people studying. I’m not even sure if photos are allowed.

I poked around the first three floors but nothing else piqued my interest. (With the entrance fee, I was limited to the first four floors.)

Great Job and Thank You!!!,"I used ÖBB for three side trips while staying in Vienna. This review will be for 1st class only. I’ll do a separate review for business class.

SALZBURG. I purchased 1st class tickets but unbeknownst to me, it did not include a seat reservation. Also, 1st class bookings did not come with light snacks or drinks. On my return to Vienna, I was grateful for my access to the ÖBB Lounge, which comes with a 1st class booking. Otherwise, I would have waited an hour in the cold since the Salzburg station is somewhat open to the elements.

BUDAPEST. After my lessons learned above, I made sure to upgrade my 1st class booking with a seat reservation (3 euro each way). I headed to the ÖBB Lounge at Wien Hauptbahnhof on the day of travel to have my upgrade printed (vs printing at a machine). I was welcomed by a very pleasant man upon entrance to the upstairs lounge. He spoke multiple languages and was friendly to every guest who walked by the desk. He not only printed out that day’s tickets but also for my upcoming trip to Prague. Upon completion, he advised me on which track to catch my train to Budapest and also encouraged me to have some food before I left. I wish everyone in hospitality was like him.

I have to note that the kitchen staff shared a similar kindness. When one of the staff members saw me studying the espresso machine, he gently asked if I needed assistance and upon my embarrassment, he remediate the situation in seconds. Just want to say THANK YOU to both of these kind souls.

VERDICT: Compared to Amtrak (USA premium rail service), ÖBB’s service is by far superior, inclusive of price point. All staff I have encountered on the trains, as well as lounges are friendly and professional.

However, compared to Renfe, Trenitalia, and Italo, 1st class perks are lacking, namely when it comes to seat reservations and on-board refreshments. This is not a deal breaker for me.

I would def recommend ÖBB and will continue to book future travels with them when I’m in Europe. And did I mention that they’ve been on time for all departures and arrivals? I’m happy to say that 96% punctuality rate they indicate on their website is real, if not higher.",December 2019,OBB,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190454-d12409735-Reviews-OBB-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",attractions,4.0,2.5
I finally found a worse airline than TAP and AA...,"I booked with Caribbean Airlines R/T nonstop from JFK to Port of Spain. I honestly don't know what possessed me to book with them. As with many of my travel decisions, I must have consulted TripAdvisor and saw that the reviews weren't that bad. If only I knew better.

1) The planes are RAGGED. They are recycled from 1980's. The seats have about as much cushion as cheap toilet paper. And the plane is just dirty. Looks like the dirt and stain have been caked on for a while. Even if the plane were to get detailed, there's no making it shine. It would need an overall gut-job in order to bring it up to expectations of today.
2) Entertainment is a joke. There are no personal monitors. Instead, they encourage you to download their app (2.5 stars on Apple as of yesterday) before closing the cabin doors. They have screens that come down (remember those from 1990?) and it's mostly a continuous loop of advertisements for the Caribbean. I think I peeped an old TV show when I looked up once. That covers about 2 hours. The remainder of the time, it's the status flight.
3) The food. UGH. The food made me sick. As an economy passenger, I don't expect much in this category but come on. Caribbean food is the best! What happened?!
4) They charge for EVERYTHING (aside from the bad food and headphones). You have to pay for snacks, some drinks, and definitely blankets. The main cabin is FREEZING. Could be due to the fact that the plane is old. (I doubt they're actually doing it on purpose.)
5) I booked months in advance for my trip to Trinidad. I must have thought that $406 R/T nonstop was a deal at the time. However, when I was looking for flights for a friend a week before my trip, I saw that JetBlue had R/T nonstop fights for $476. I would have happily paid that on JetBlue. Bells and whistles for $70?! I'll take it. In my case, I upgraded my seat on the way back for extra leg room for $39.78. Essentially, I paid $446 for my flight +/-.

I will say that boarding the plane was sort of better than TAP Portugal. They basically start with the usual - Business Class, Extra Leg Room, Passengers with Children. Then it seems they start boarding the back of the plane. However, you would never know. You have got to, GOT TO pay attention once you see people stir at your gate.

Also, my flight landed on time at Port of Spain and it sort of landed on time in JFK on my flight home. We drove around the tarmac for a solid 10 mins. Otherwise, we would have arrived on time.

Overall, I do not plan on flying with Caribbean Airlines again. It wasn't completely horrible but I'm willing to pay $70 extra for the bells and whistles with JetBlue.",January 2019,Caribbean Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8728962-Reviews-Caribbean-Airlines,World,flights,1.0,3.5
Hot Mess,"When I start thinking about my experience over Thanksgiving, I start to laugh because you will not believe how ridiculously unprofessional TAP Portugal crew is! First of all, they don't even know how to set up the line stanchions! The sign says A|B. So you would think A to the left, B to the right. Nope. The flight attendant decided to take creative freedom and switch it up. And if you were in the wrong line, she sent you to the back! It wasn't just that, the crew needs proper training on organization and efficiency. I would totally be a consultant and help them for free if they would let me.

Sometime during the flight one of the attendants told me (she didn't ask) to put the shades down. I said, ""Miss, that man is sleeping against it. I'm not touching him."" She pointed out that the sun was going to come up soon. I advised her to shut the shades herself or wake up the passenger and have him do it. I do not want an altercation with another passenger esp when the man is resting!

Then...My seat mate asked the same flight attendant about the meal since she ordered the meat dish. The attendant said, ""I don't know what to tell you."" And that's it!!! She walked away LOL. So that was getting to Lisbon.

Leaving Lisbon was even worse! It made me swear that I will never ever fly TAP EVER! Again with the lines! How hard is it to put up stanchions!!! I felt so bad for this older woman that I told her to get in front of me and pay no mind to anyone who has anything to say. More importantly, we were an hour late because of their lack in organization. Once I stepped to show my passport, the flight attendant noted that my carry-on was oversized. Um, HI. It was the same size as when I left JFK! And why don't know you know which luggage fits and which doesn't. So long story short, I was forced to check in. I tried to fight their crazy and pointed out how airlines are notorious for losing luggage. They assured me that I will get it soon as the flight lands. LIES! But I'll get to that.

As I try to mosey my way through the cabin, one of the male flight attendants thought it would be a good idea to block the way right in front of the threshold. Like, are you serious! Do you not see people are trying to get on the plane?! We're already an hour late! He was concerned about counting cups!!!

The best part of the trip was when Captain Mumbles was making public service announcements and one of the flight attendants was yap-yap-yapping away. And loudly too! I thought it was someone's iPad and they were watching Jerry Springer in Portuguese. Soooo UNPROFESSIONAL!!!

So about my luggage. It wasn't right outside the door as they had advised. I had to get it at baggage claim. I have not had to go to baggage claim since circa 2012 and that was because my bf brought stuff back from MX!

The only thing good I have to say, which earns them 1 star, is TAP's movie selection. Totally up to date. I watched Crazy Rich Asians; Ocean's 8; Deadpool 2; Mission Impossible; and Lara Croft. I had a lot of time since I couldn't sleep on the flight. The economy seat is made for a 12 yr old malnourished girl.",November 2018,TAP Air Portugal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729164-Reviews-TAP-Air-Portugal,World,flights,1.0,3.0
How to Effectively Handle Delays During The Holiday Season: 2018 Edition,"I am writing re: Air France flight from JFK-CDG-MXP. First off, Air France was 3 hours late departing from JFK. The crew indicated that the fog was to blame but I think the crew could have cleaned the aircraft faster. After all, this is what they do on a daily basis.

As you may have already guessed, 3-hour delay in departure impacted our arrival at CDG, which caused me to miss my connection flight to Milan. I appreciate that Air France took care of the booking but having to wait 10 hours for the next flight is totally unacceptable! There were so many options!!! There were so many opportunities for Air France to be proactive in this process. Instead, they fell short.

When I finally found the transfer desk in Terminal 2F at CDG, I spoke to one of the team members who genuinely wanted to help. Quickly, he found one seat remaining on the 12:20 flight from CDG to Linate. However, his request to put me on this flight was rejected. He was advised that I cannot deter from my original destination, i.e. I cannot land at a different airport in Milan. Why? He couldn’t tell me because he also didn’t understand.

So then this gentleman tried another option. He found a different flight, but the seat was in business class. So again, his request was rejected. I would ask, why wouldn’t Air France bump someone else up to business class whom they thought was more deserving other than myself, so that I can have a seat in economy? And why am I making suggestions that Air France should know on their own? After all, this is THEIR field of expertise.

After running out of options, the gentleman encouraged me to speak to a supervisor, only there wasn’t one available. He stepped out and I waited for the only supervisor to free up. Unfortunate for me, my efforts were fruitless. Soon as she finished with the family she was dealing with, she disappeared.

I decided to try again and asked one of the women to help me. She wasn’t too keen on helping; she embodied the stereotype of a rude Parisian. I held my tongue since I was technically at her mercy; I did not want to be stuck in CDG for 10 hours! I pressed on and asked about different options. She was insistent that I had no choice but to wait for my flight at 20:55 because all the flights were overbooked due to the holidays. I asked about Lufthansa and she said that they were not part of the “Alliance”. I then asked her about KLM flight (CDG-AMS-MXP) leaving at 15:40. She had advised that the flight was overbooked and that I would more than likely get stuck in Amsterdam. I gave up soon after. I asked for a food voucher since none was offered to me and walked away frustrated and dejected.

I am running on zero sleep in more than 24 hours. More importantly, I will be losing all of today, 12/22, in Milan because I am sitting here in CDG. I would love to imagine what would happen if Air France was more proactive in helping their clients. It’s no surprise when I say that I am very much disappointed in Air France.

Lastly, I am fully aware that there are cultural differences when it comes to customer service. Based on my personal experience, Air France doesn’t believe that the customer is always right, but what happened to human decency? I was not offered an upgrade on my flight to Milan OR my return flight to JFK (nonstop, thank goodness!). I would like to know why. Is Air France really that stoic?

DON’T!,"With the exception of my visit to Panera Bread Bryant Park, I have only enjoyed Panera in the suburbs, i.e. with pleasant employees. Imagine my surprise when I was minding my own business and the worker bee at Pick-Up started talking about me in front of ME! Her beef? She was calling some woman's name and decided that it was MY name. When I told her that my name is ""January, just like the month"" she equated her ignorance to me having an attitude. So she continued to tell her co-worker how, ""It must be today. All day people be havin attitudes.""

After it was clear she wasn't coming up for air, I suggested aloud that she find another industry since she obviously wasn’t cut out for the service industry. My advice didn't stop her chatter and her co-worker fed her crazy. Fortunately, my order came up. I then bid her a better night and a better job.

Not only has this worker bee perpetuated the misconception about New Yorkers, but she slashed any semblance of the Panera Brand.

Moral of the Story: DO NOT go to Panera, aside from locations in the 'burbs. Otherwise, you'll be turned off. More importantly, the food wasn't that great. I got the Mediterranean sandwich which was haphazardly thrown together. The bread was so dense and not fresh; the only thing consistent with what I've had in the past was the color of the bread. I would have been better off going to a random NY deli.",January 2018,Panera Bread,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d5066123-Reviews-Panera_Bread-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Brooklyn in Madrid,"I didn't know what to expect when I walked in this morning due to the mixed reviews re: rudeness. However, the travel gods must have been with me. The cashier was not only nice but pleasant. Also, he picked up on the fact that I'm American so he said everything in English, which was very much appreciated. I placed an order for what I call the TripAdvisor Special: Red Velvet Latte with Smoked Salmon Avocado Toast.

When I sat down to wait for my order, I noticed the music right away. Ol skool hip hop. I thought to myself, if Pharrell owned a coffee house, it would be similar to this one. I think I waited a good 15 mins for my latte and toast but it was worth it. The latte was so GOOD! I mean, I could have drank vats of that until my heart exploded. It tasted exactly like red velvet but the coffee cut the sweetness. It was well executed; I know I am going to surely miss it when I go back to NYC. The salmon toast was good, but nothing mind-blowing.

A little night music,"First off, I don’t listen to jazz on the regular. All I know is John Coltrane’s Blue Train. It’s my go to when I needed to get lost in music, without moving. That’s the extent of my experience.

There was a line before the place even opened and no one even knew who was performing. I figured I’d check it out anyway because La Zorra y El Cuervo is supposedly famous and second to none as far as jazz venues are concerned.

The show was pretty cool but I only liked the first group out of three. Never knew the flute could slay Cuban jazz!

I would definitely come back again.",April 2017,La Zorra y el Cuervo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147271-d259676-Reviews-La_Zorra_y_el_Cuervo-Havana_Ciudad_de_la_Habana_Province_Cuba.html,Cuba,attractions,5.0,4.5
mehhhhh...,"I'm disappointed to say that I finally had my first subpar meal in Mexico City.  The best way I can describe Testal is Mexican-Asian fusion, at least based on the the dishes I got.

Plus the vibe was kind of off.  Maybe it was the timing?  I went around 3.30pm, so after the lunch rush but before the start of the dinner rush? I don't know.  Maybe the Americans who sat across from me annoyed me more than I was aware?  (They were obnoxious.  Think, privileged while males.)

Also, my server was nice but really awkward.  He kept hovering, which is a no-no for New Yorkers like me.   Yet when I needed the check, he was nowhere to be found!

I ordered Sopa Seca y Dorada de Fideo and Tacos Camaron Mezcal.  The former was a huge surprise!  It wasn't soup at all.  It was DRY cutup noodles!  Mixed in were bean paste, cheese, and slices of fried chiles.  It may sound unappetizing but it was actually good.

I also didn't expect my shrimp tacos to be wrapped in egg roll.  It was drowning in (rock shrimp) sauce.  If they would have just drizzled a little bit, it would have been ok.  Otherwise, it was too much.  I would have preferred it without the sauce, actually.

I ordered Mescal but barely touched it.  It was so strong!  (I hadn't seen cocktails on the menu, but I have a feeling that the waiter just didn't bring me the right one.)  After my water was gone and I wasn't offered another, it was over.  I definitely wasn't going to drink it without a chaser!

While I was leaving, I spoke to the restaurant manager since he was the only one who spoke English.  I asked him where I could buy bags of candy vs buying it piecemeal on the street.  He told me to walk three blocks down the same street and on my left will be a big candy store.  I followed his directions to a tee.  Not only was the ""big store"" closed, but it was also a house supply store.  (Thanks, guy!  You're a winner.)

"Eating My Way Thru Mexico City: El Cardenal, Part I","El Cardenal is located inside Hilton Mexico City Reforma.  I went to the restaurant for breakfast on my first full day in Mexico City.  I didn't feel welcomed by the hostess, but that's ok.  Quenching my hunger was too important.  (TBH, I think they were surprised to see a female on her own.)  

I was seated in the second half of the dining area since the main dining room was full.  (My airbnb host had warned me that it's best to get there between 8-9am; otherwise, expect to wait an hour for a table.)  Since it was a Friday morning, it was mostly full of middle-aged professionals. 

Aaron, my server, was so friendly and genuine!  Unlike the hostess, Aaron was so welcoming; I appreciated all his recommendations.

I've traveled around the world and have been fortunate to eat in some fancy places but this meal was THE BEST BREAKFAST I've ever had!  EVER.  I started with Natas, which is creamy layer of milk.  I guess it's specific to the restaurant.  I don't know what's in there, but WHOA!  And it didn't hurt my stomach, as most cheese do!  I scooped Natas atop the Concha bread, which is a type of Mexican sweet bread.  Heavenly combo.

My sensory overload didn't stop there.  Aaron had recommended getting the Hacienda de Puebla for my main course.  It was supposed to come with sunny side-up eggs but Aaron advised that I could have it with scrambled eggs, if I preferred.  And so I did.  What I got looked like a form of Huevos Rancheros but it was so much better!

I would have floated out of El Cardenal from being so happy, but instead I rolled out.

WINNER!!!,"I went to GoTan, per my airbnb host's suggestion.  Let me preface the meal by saying that I was so happy that I almost cried!  It was AMAZING!  

First of all, the service was impeccable; Sara made me feel at home.  When I told her that I'm vegetarian, she did her best to modify her recommendations to suit my diet restriction.  I really appreciate her efforts because most people either think 1) I only eat vegetables OR 2)  I eat chicken.  (I'm talking to you, American Airlines!)

For starters, I ordered the 4 cheese empanada and humi.  The former was PERFECTION!!!  I don't know what the four cheeses were, but I could have just had that and been satisfied!  But when I tasted the humi, I couldn't stop eating.  

For the main dish, I ordered ravioli.  Sara had suggested pairing it with a mushroom cream sauce.  I'm usually not a fan of anything creamy, but I was glad that I kept an open mind.  And it wasn't standard issue mushroom cream sauce!  This Argentinian mix had toasted grains, topped with freshly-shaved parmesan cheese.  I had to consciously put my fork down in between bites!

Throughout dinner, my taste buds loved me!  The only reason why I finally stopped eating was because my stomach wouldn't let me!  I was so FULL!

Aside from helping me with my meal selection, Sara also chatted with me during my meal, but without hovering. She made sure I was fairing well, and that everything was up to my standards. (The owner came by at one point to clear a dish; she was very friendly as well.)

If I can help it, I want to have a repeat meal at GoTan before I head back to NYC.  Thank you so much, Sara!

Would definitely come back!!!,"Through my timeshare exchange program, I was able to book a week at The Royal Haciendas in Playa del Carmen. I never expect anything from exchanges and yet again, I was pleasantly surprised. Everyone is genuinely nice; this is a lot to be said when customer service is nearly dead in NYC. Our personal concierge, Estella, is a sweet lady. She respected our time and privacy and in return, we attended an informational session on timeshares at The Royal. Again, our time was respected so we were there for 30 minutes tops (record!). There was no curtness or rudeness when we declined to buy, just a request to tell friends and family about The Royal.

Here's a summary of our week:

PRO's
- Great hospitality.
- Excellent amenities. No extra charges for rental of kayaks, snorkeling gear, golf clubs, tennis racquets and courts.
- Never crowded at the pool or beach.
- Quiet.
- CLEAN. Everywhere you go was spotless. We actually saw groundskeepers raking seaweed along the beach.
- Grocery store on site which was reasonably priced.

CON's
- Gym use comes with daily charge, unless you book a treatment at the spa.
