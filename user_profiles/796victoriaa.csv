LovelyðŸ˜ŒðŸ’•,"Well, not eaten or had coffee in here for quite sometime, as was no alternatives to dairy/wheat etc in the past... but, been in here twice in past few weeks and very impressed!! Yummy brunches and the service is great! Very quick, friendly and both times served by a young girl in glasses and dark hair (sorry, wish I had got your name today!). So helpful and chilled out, food delicious both times and very helpful around dairy alternatives with coffee- lovely coffee!
May now be my new favourite for brunch... service with a smile and attentiveness makes a massive difference ...lovely atmosphere- plus always enjoyed a random evening in here previously for a few drinks",February 2020,Tea Rooms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2146344-d11965051-Reviews-Tea_Rooms-Birkdale_Southport_Merseyside_England.html,"Birkdale, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.0
"I love this place, as Iâ€™ve","I love this place, as Iâ€™ve been going there regularly for the past few years! Become a local and know some of the staff... however the atmosphere feels a little sad in there the past 3 months and the service isnâ€™t as good ...over the past 6-8 weeks Iâ€™ve been there 4 times and something has been forgotten, or weâ€™ve been left waiting altogether, with no service at all- Iâ€™m not one to rush, or complain- but a little upset at the change in this lovely place... took my parents for the first time last night and I had already mentioned to one of the team at a prior visit, that things seemed different and we were left waiting or things forgotten every time and the same thing happened last night with my parents! We were left sitting there for 20 minutes and had to call staff over to take our order- felt forgotten about again... they changed though after this and seemed a bit more attentive and one of the team even expressed that the massive party of people they had in, had meant a small delay in our food coming out, but it was on its way and this was fine, appreciated this thought.
Beautiful food indeed, as always, but I just feel sad that it feels like things are a little bit gloomy in there now and the service is very different. Would recommend, but I am worried about going in there now, due to ongoing issues with service and the atmosphere.",February 2020,Villaggio Cucina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g191255-d2698433-Reviews-Villaggio_Cucina-Southport_Merseyside_England.html,"Southport, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Absolutely great place and,Absolutely great place and so friendly... Luis in particular was so welcoming and almost felt part of their restaurant family!

The best restaurant during our visit :),"The best restaurant during our stay, friendly and absolutely delicious-we went twice and also got complimentary drinks the second time... a must to visit. They also cater for dairy free coffees and gluten/ wheat free pasta. Many places nearby didnâ€™t have these options. And the baklava was enormous and so nice! Brilliant place.",October 2019,Arcadia Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1501262-Reviews-Arcadia_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Incredible change of guard...,"This is a must do in Athens, the culture of this is amazing with the way the soldiers move- steeped in ancient tradition... spend a good half an hour watching what happens.
Total respect.",October 2019,Hellenic Parliament,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198707-Reviews-Hellenic_Parliament-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Amazing!,"You literally cannot imagine this place until you see it for yourself in real life! Incredible... you can feel the history :)
Would suggest going up on a slightly overcast day like we did, as it would be so hot otherwise and limited shade in the main areas up there... take plenty of water and take your time... it was busy when we went, so the summer months would be crazy I imagine. Go later in the year would be my advice...
An absolute must see :)",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Absolutely incredible!,"A must for visiting Athens... you can get a huge amount of knowledge about what the Acropolis and Athens is all about from this museum... allow a good few hours or a whole day though to take everything in!
Brilliant!",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Lovely!!,"Absolutely lovely little place off the main Plaka walk... they absolutely know their wines and even the little food plate was delicious to go with the wine that Andreas carefully chose, based on me saying I like to â€˜chewâ€™ my red wines! Delicious!",October 2019,Wine O'Clock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d11644847-Reviews-Wine_O_Clock-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Funny and great place,"We popped in here to watch the Wales v Fiji rugby World Cup game the other day and it turned into a full afternoon of entertainment with Dimitri and Peter! Absolutely brilliant pair of bartenders, a double act for sure. So fun and also very professional and attentive... food and beer was great too. Only problem was that they had run out of chicken- but that didnâ€™t dampen any of the spirit and we had a great time (and accidentally had too much to drink too!).
Would recommend :)",October 2019,Athens Sports Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2642955-Reviews-Athens_Sports_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Relaxing,"Lovely little place.
Sat amongst the books- delicious coffee and tasty sandwiches.
Would massively recommend the apple pie! Delicious! :)",October 2019,Little Tree Books & Coffee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10868423-Reviews-Little_Tree_Books_Coffee-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Disappointing given the reviews...,"We visited given the great reviews we saw.
Very disappointed sadly... staff a little lethargic, uninterested and misleading regarding gluten free and descriptions of food on menu.
I had the lamb fricasse, which was basically so acidic I couldnâ€™t eat it. My partner had chicken gyros and had no taste or flavour.
Dips and pitta were ok.
I ended up getting stomach ache and indigestion immediately after eating some of my dish...When I said I disliked the dish and felt a little unwell, the waiter did seem concerned and made me a herbal tea which was a kind gesture, so this is why weâ€™ve rated poor rather than terrible.
Shame really...",October 2019,Ella Greek Cooking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d15124215-Reviews-Ella_Greek_Cooking-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5

Fabulous little place away from hustle and bustle ...,"We are away for a week in Athens at the moment and we just keep coming back here! Weâ€™ve done lunch, brunch, night time coffee and take away coffee/cake...
Whilst some of the busier places in Plaka are nice, this place has the edge over most of them to be honest...
Great food, coffee (with dairy free alternatives!), gluten free options, vegetarian options and lovely welcoming homely staff...
Love it :)",October 2019,Gargaretta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d16750401-Reviews-Gargaretta-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Rude!,"We just popped in for a coffee after a great meal elsewhere... asked the waiter if they did soya/alternative milks... he said he would ask, then never came back to us! Embarrassed, we just left ...just rude if you ask me, he could have just either asked us again, or just say no if that was the case... if you canâ€™t just serve a coffee, itâ€™s not even worth trying for anything else!",October 2019,Oionos Cafe Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d17451542-Reviews-Oionos_Cafe_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,1.0,3.5
