Main objective to see in Athens,"Great archaeological site to visit. If there can be only one objective you see in Athens, this should be it.

Be prepared with water, sun screen and clothing that protects you against the sun. And go in the morning - first entrance is at 8 AM. We visited this in September and it was scorching hot on the plateau.

If you cannot, be prepared for huge crowds up on the Acropolis as there are several bottlenecks that are typically very crowded.

Enjoy the site once you get there!",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Regular stop for locals,"This is usually a weekly visit for myself and my partner as it is one of the better restaurants in the neighborhood. Plenty of food options depending on what you prefer - cooked food, small bites like cheese, olives, onion rings, fries etc. I particularly enjoy the cordon bleu and the burgers are not bad either. Plenty of beers to choose from as well.

There was a recent change in staff (and probably ownership) and have not yet got accustomed with the new staff, but will get there.

Do not miss the artist alleys around,"The artist alleys around the Montmartre area are the real attraction in my opinion. Full of painters and sketch artists, small art shops and souvenir shops the atmosphere is really vibrant and nice.

Not there for the Mona Lisa,"Although not an art fan I enjoyed the setup of the museum and found a few art pieces that I really liked (to name a couple: the Lady of the Revolution or the Victory sculpture right at the top of the monumental stairs leading into the Italian paintings area). The highlight of the trip for me was the Egyptian part of the museum which even though I felt it was less imposing than the British Museum it was still a great gallery.

We entered through the Pyramid with a fixed hour ticket (9 AM). The waiting time was around 30 mins but the queue behind was significantly longer. My suggestion if possible is to go there at the opening time.

As you go past the Mona Lisa room there is a coffee corner if you want to stop and rest a bit - the quiche there is amazing and the coffee is good too. Highly recommended especially since there are not that many other break opportunities (other than sofas around the museum).",April 2019,Louvre Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188757-Reviews-Louvre_Museum-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,4.0,4.5
Feeling ripped off after watching movie in theater 13,"Theater 13 is one of the worst modern movie theaters I've been in. The theater is extremely small (around 70 people) and a screen to match. That is definitely not the screen size you would expect in a modern theater (maybe 1/3 of the normal movie screens). The placement of the screen and the poor chairs which are much too low to the ground but with a normal back angle (instead of a steeper angle allowing you to sink in) gave me a back and neck pain and it was the same for my girlfriend.

I felt ripped off! That is definitely not worth 11 EUR. Beware as this is not advertised at all so people do not know what to expect. Avoid at all costs screenings in theater 13 if you want to enjoy a modern movie experience!",November 2018,UGC Toison d'Or Cinema,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188644-d7272177-Reviews-UGC_Toison_d_Or_Cinema-Brussels.html,"Brussels, Belgium",attractions,2.0,2.5
Tasty & fun,"This is a chocolate workshop, as described in the title. What you should expect is to play with chocolate, learn how to make pralines from it and then make them yourself. The instructions are straight-forward and easy to follow even if you aren't particularly skilled in the kitchen.

Our instructors and hosts were Catalina and Teach (probably ruined his name) and they were very helpful and friendly.

Towards the end of the experience, part of the leftover chocolate will be used to make a bit of hot chocolate which is extremely tasty. Other than that bring some water and be prepared to stand up for the whole duration - in the end it's a workshop not a cafe/restaurant :).",October 2018,Belgian Chocolate Workshop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188644-d11639442-Reviews-Belgian_Chocolate_Workshop-Brussels.html,"Brussels, Belgium",attractions,4.0,4.5
Unexpectedly amazing food,"Decided to drop by this restaurant while on a day trip to Mechelen. It was never planned but we happened to be in the area while starving and the smell drew us in.

The restaurant is on the premises of the brewery and it serves all of the beers (Gouden Carolus) and the whiskies. Yes, the beer brewery is also a whiskey distillery.

I had tasted the whiskey before and I now wanted to try the beer. As a fan of dark beer I was not disappointed by the Gouden Carolus Classic. A strong beer (8% if I remember correctly) with a very nice taste and a smooth finish. Looking forward to trying it again in the future but I definitely see this as climbing in the top three of Belgian beers. I also tried Ambrio (their amber beer) but that was not as good.

For food I decided on the pork ribs and although I am not a connoisseur I had my fair share of ribs in the past 5 years. These beat all the standards I had in my mind. First and foremost the plate was huge - containing 2 large pork ribs and a coleslaw salad. The ribs had a good mixture of meat and fat and they literally melted in your mouth. As a side I ordered some fries which were tasty as well - but in the end fries are fries.

The staff was nice and friendly and most, if not all, spoke English so that was a plus.

Extremely glad to have found this place and I will for sure visit again whenever I have a craving for pork ribs or willing to try some other quality food.",June 2018,Het Anker,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188637-d740515-Reviews-Het_Anker-Mechelen_Antwerp_Province.html,"Mechelen, Belgium",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Steampunk atmosphere,"Great setting in the Old City centre of Bucharest. The theme of this restaurant is based on Jules Verne's novels and it definitely stands out among other bistros. Nice and laid back atmosphere with some very tasty food options make it a great place to meet friends and spend some quality time. Also, the beer, it is one of the few places in Bucharest where I found Grimbergen Amber - very tasty Belgian beer.",December 2017,Joben Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294458-d12881026-Reviews-Joben_Bistro-Bucharest.html,"Bucharest, Romania",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good but not great (even for history fans),"As I am a big history fan this was a must see in Barcelona especially given the current political circumstances (my visit was right after Catalunya held the independence referendum). What I liked about the museum is that it has a very modern feel to it, trying to tell the (hi)story through pictures, maps, dioramas and actual artifacts. The building housing it is also an old dockyard building that was repaired and repurposed.

What I didn't particularly like about the museum though is that it didn't convey the history of the Catalunyan people but the history of the space that is called Catalunya. Or in other words, the story of the population inhabiting Catalunya over the centuries and not that of the Catalunyan people. I don't feel like I know a lot more about the Catalunyan people after visiting the museum than I knew before.

On the topic of the restaurant, I can't say anything about the eating experience because we didn't stay. However, if you do go, note that the restaurant has several different sections: the room you enter is for drinks and deserts, as well as the terrace; the second room is where you can eat the regular courses and you have a wide selection of wines available.",October 2017,Museu d'Historia de Catalunya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d246512-Reviews-Museu_d_Historia_de_Catalunya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,3.0,4.5
Amazing experience and beautiful photos,"I booked this on an impulse, seeing it on Trip Advisor and liking the idea and results posted by people. It did not disappoint!

We stayed in Barcelona for 5 days and this was on the last day of our visit. We booked a tour of the Gothic and Born quarters and our host was Joan, a very cheerful and skillful photographer as well as very knowledgeable about the history of the quarters. He was very patient with us and with our lack of prior photoshoot experience and he calmly directed us into the setting. Looking at the end result a few days later I must say that the composition of the photos is beautiful and even spectacular in some of the shots. Rest assured he will be able to accommodate all types of people, from the least comfortable in front of a camera, to the most comfortable.

The guided part of the tour was extremely interesting and entertaining and it was very nicely spaced out so that the approximately two hours of walking and stopping for pictures went by in a blink of an eye. The stories he tells and the explanations provide a greater depth to the city itself and help you understand a bit how people lived there centuries ago. Joan was also kind enough to point out some very good places to eat - not necessarily known to tourists.

I recommend Photoshoot Tours without any reservation and my only recommendation is to enjoy the experience as much as possible because that will show on camera and you will enjoy the captured memories even more!",October 2017,Gothic Quarter Photoshoot Tour in Barcelona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187497-d11485379-Gothic_Quarter_Photoshoot_Tour_in_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",activities,5.0,5.0
Modern bookshop experience,"This bookshop offers the modern experience I particularly enjoy. Books surrounded by small gadgets and items that you never thought you would need but somehow they manage to find their way into your shopping cart.

While most of the books are in Dutch there are also a few shelves of books in other languages (mostly English), which is always great if you like dropping by a bookstore when visiting another town, like me and you happen to not speak the local language.

Staff is nice and there are plenty of info points spread across the bookstore and there is also a cafe inside. Very good spot if you like books and want to take a break to grab something sweet or maybe a cup of coffee/tea.",July 2017,Donner Bookshop Rotterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188632-d6033759-Reviews-Donner_Bookshop_Rotterdam-Rotterdam_South_Holland_Province.html,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,4.0,4.5

Not your regular market,"It's not just the architecture and design that make the Markthal in Rotterdam special, but the atmosphere inside which is nothing that you would expect from a regular market. You can find specialised meat shops, tea & coffee, spices, food stands selling sweets, restaurants and fast foods etc.

For someone who prefers supermarkets over regular outdoor markets I have to say that I immediately fell in love with this place.",July 2017,Markthal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188632-d7129022-Reviews-Markthal-Rotterdam_South_Holland_Province.html,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
Not your regular food court,"At first, it doesn't seem like the place where you would go eat. Across the Erasmus bridge and into the harbour warehouses area, this used to be the Red Light District of Rotterdam where sailors would try to find affordable booze, bed and love.

Recently, this was the target of several projects of rebranding and what a success these were. Fenix food factory is one of the examples.

Going into the warehouse you pass by people casually eating or drinking either at wooden tables or by the water. Nothing is fancy and you should not expect it in this place. Nevertheless, the food is very tasty and rather cheap.

If you know what you're going to have then great, you can go straight to the shop selling that particular thing (meat/cheese/soups & salads/Turkish/bakery) and then eat inside or outside. If you're just visiting the place for the first time and you're not sure what to get, there's a little stand right next to the entrance where you can pay 15 EUR for a wooden platter and a collection of vouchers for the shops in the factory. What that gets you is one item from each shop in the food factory (with the exception of drinks where you need to choose upfront what you want). This allows you to sample most of what the place has to offer at a good price.

Definitely worth a visit or more. The food was really good once we got over the initial confusion.",July 2017,Fenix Food Factory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188632-d6857288-Reviews-Fenix_Food_Factory-Rotterdam_South_Holland_Province.html,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Splendid ice cream, poor location","I love Haagen Dazs ice cream. It is tasty and balanced and has a nice texture, unlike other ice cream brands where you usually get water mixed with sugary flavours and frozen.

However, what I also expect from a fancier ice cream shop like Haagen Dazs is to also have a nice atmosphere inside. My ideal location involves a controlled temperature inside that is around 20 degrees (yes, that means air conditioning) and a mild vanilla scent in the air.

This Haagen Dazs has neither of the above. The interior is very packed with tables so you can expect it to be really crowded (slow service) and there was no air conditioning whatsoever (unclear if it was a technical issue today or it is always like that). It felt better outside than inside which means that you are better off buying some ice cream to go and walk around the shops than sitting down in this ice cream shop. You will most probably not enjoy the ice cream as much as you could.",July 2017,Häagen Dazs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d2657717-Reviews-Haagen_Dazs-Brussels.html,"Brussels, Belgium",restaurants,2.0,2.5
I just keep coming back,"This is my 4th visit to this restaurant and I love it.
The staff is awesome - really paying attention to their customers and helping out with recommendations, if needed.

The vibe is nice and the interior setup is great. Plus, it has air conditioning, which on a hot summer day (that used to be few and far between) is invaluable.

The food is good if you like deep fried stuff. Several burgers and chips are on the menu, together with some chicken strips, chicken wings and fish and chips. They also have options for groups (the cheese and charcuterie platter is big and good).

The drinks menu may seem quite large at first but the drinks are seasonally stockpiled so they never had all of the beers in a category. In order to not be disappointed that you picked several drinks they may not have I recommend you ask the staff what beers are currently available in the category you want and they will surely help you out with a suggestion.",June 2017,The Black Sheep,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d6547349-Reviews-The_Black_Sheep-Brussels.html,"Brussels, Belgium",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Poor service,"If this had better service it would probably be close to 4 stars. The location is good (across the street from cinquintennaire). The food seems to be good from the other comments posted by people who managed to get to order their food. The drink selection is good. But the service for the terrace was nonexistent. 20 minutes later we got up and left without having the chance to order anything. This happened right in front of the waiter that seated us and brought us menus. Not even an apology or an attempt to turn us around. I can understand having a bad day but this was simply rude behaviour.

Outstanding setting & food,"The building which hosts the restaurant dates back to the end of the 19th century - 1898 and has seen several restoration and consolidation works. The inside section is filled with paintings, frescoes, sculptures and stained glass and the restaurant usually hosts some live music bands which add to the setting.

Serenity,"After standing in the queues at the Colosseum, walking through the timeless vestiges of Roman power and discovering awe inspiring vistas of old and new Rome, the Palatine Hill provided the much needed relaxation and calmness.

Here you can find a magnificently quiet plateau containing even older ruins - it is said that one of the ruined homes belonged to Romulus, one of the founders of Rome - and also a museum of Roman history.

The best part of the visit was the view on the Southern side of the hill overlooking Circus Maximus where a fight between Roman legions and barbarians was staged.

Unexpectedly awesome experience,"We decided to drop by this restaurant, located in the very trendy Andel area in Prague, since it was close to the hotel we were staying in. The restaurant is a bit below street level and it looks very rustic inside.

The first thing that hit me (in a good way) was the music. Its volume was perfect so that you can hear it, but you don't need to raise your voice to make yourself understood at the table. Plus, they played for the entire duration of our lunch Bryan Adams - of whom I'm a big fan.

So the music was very good, but how was the food? Spectacular! I had the plate sized pork schnitzel (and the plates are big) together with some potatoes au gratin. The schnitzel came with very tasty pickles and everything was delicious. My girlfriend had gnocchi with mushrooms which was extremely tasty as well. But all of the plates we saw being delivered by the waiters looked very very good.

Definitely highly recommended and it is well worth a trip to Andel.",August 2016,Zlaty Klas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d1235757-Reviews-Zlaty_Klas-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Must see in Prague!,"We happened to bump into this small museum while doing a bit of planning for our upcoming trip to Prague. We were immediately hooked by the idea and the ""occult"" experience this museum was supposed to provide.

The museum itself is not too difficult to locate in Prague since it is a couple of streets away from the Old City Centre - the house that hosts the museum is in the second oldest building in Prague and it is part of the Jewish quarter.

As soon as you enter you are almost taken back to the 16th century with potions and flasks resting on the shelves (by the way, they are for sale so if you do not have to fly out of Prague it may be worth purchasing something) and various creature skins hanging on the walls. It looks very arcane and extremely well ornamented.

The tour itself takes you through the study and the actual ancient laboratory and you receive a lot of details and history along the way - the guide was very informative and helpful.

I will stop here with the description as I do not want to spoil the surprises this place holds, but if you are in Prague and have 1 hour of time treat yourself to this hidden gem!",August 2016,Speculum Alchemiae Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d4194102-Reviews-Speculum_Alchemiae_Museum-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",attractions,5.0,4.5

If you want to see everything and take it all in plan to spend 5-6 hours inside. There are several restaurants there but we haven't tried them.

On the one hand there are the Moorish gardens, small and cosy, with a picturesque running fountain, while on the other hand you have the old Roman fort with its stark military nature. It is said that Hannibal Barca conquered this Roman fort during the Second Punic War and the main gate has his name.

There is a road train connecting the tourist centre in Xativa with the castle but you can also go on foot. Comfortable footwear and plenty of drinking water are highly recommended.
