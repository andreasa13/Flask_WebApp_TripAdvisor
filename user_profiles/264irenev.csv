Amazing,"Our tour guide Dimitris from Athens by bike recommended us to visit the Acropolis Museum before climbing the Acropolis mountain and see the Acropolis temple. That was a great advice! We visited the beautiful museum and learned more about the history of the Acropolis. Experiencing the Acropolis after that made so much more sense. Me and my daughter, we were in aw of the beauty. We walked the different routes. We had no map though, that would have been practical, due to the different routes and exits.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Most wonderful tour through the city of Athens,"Me and my 17 year old daughter signed up for this bike tour at the start of our holiday week in Athens. We had a most wonderful experience and learned a lot about the city and itâ€™s history through our most friendly, positive energetic guide Dimitris. We received many good tips for the rest of our holiday. I would 100% recommend this tour!!!",October 2019,Athens Scenic Bike Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11464352-Athens_Scenic_Bike_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
