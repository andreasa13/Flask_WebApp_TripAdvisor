Good Place to stay,"Pine Park is a large property situated in Shogran. The access to the resort is through a winding dirt road that can only be accomplished by a 4x4. The resort which has been recently renovated has almost 50 plus rooms of various categories which includes cottages as well as private rooms. The propery has a vast well maintained lawn. I recommend taking the rooms which face the lawn and avoid the ones facing the mountains. The property is well run by Mr Rasheed the Manager. It serves as the base for day trips to Siri Pai and Shinkiari Hut.
The only downside to the property is the high price and quality of food. It is recommended to eat outside or bring your own food and due to the poor road one has limited choice of dinner.
Overall its a great place to stay. Neat and clean",August 2020,Pine Park Hotels And Resorts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1760383-d7282580-Reviews-Pine_Park_Hotels_And_Resorts-Shogran_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa_Province.html,"Shogran, Pakistan",hotels,4.0,4.0
Once in a lifetime experience,"We visited the Acropolis in January i.e. during the off season time. There were a limited number of people and one could freely wander around the place. Also since it was cold we did not need a lot of water. The place is full of various ancient sites in which some the structure are there while in others its just stones and a history. The main part which is the Parthenon is under repairs however the restoration have been stopped since last year probably due to lack of funds. Since it sits on top of a hill there are various points to see Athens. There are guides who will charge you 30 euro per person for the tour , trust me it not worth it as everything is clearly marked and written down. It should take you a maximum of one and half hour to see the place completely provided there is no crowd. This is must see if you come to Athens",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Stop Enroute to Genting Highlands,"We took the cable car to Genting Highlands and this is one of the stops during the journey. You can get off and and rejoin again. Once getting off be prepared for a long walk back fortunately thru escalators. Once you reach Chin Wee Temple you can roam around and spend maximum 25-30 minutes here. The places of interest is the massive Buddha Statue , the smaller statues as well as the temple itself. You can roam around and enjoy the views as they are breath taking with the floating clouds if the weather is rainy.",June 2019,Chin Swee Cave Temple,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g660784-d3280389-Reviews-Chin_Swee_Cave_Temple-Genting_Highlands_Pahang.html,"Genting Highlands, Malaysia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Short and Sweet Like Strawberry,Visited this place during a day tour to Genting Highlands. Maximum spend 20 minutes here. The charges are 20 ringitt per head and it allows you inside the farm. You can harvest some strawberry but they are sold separately upon weighing and quire expensive. Its a nice once in a while experience and if the weather is nice you can enjoy taking pictures with the flowers and gardens.
