"Really nice, go if you have the time","Incredible scenery, really nice if you re into temples and stuff like that. The walk to the top ( where you will find a stadium ) is a bit hard i guess ( for some ?! ) but totally worth it",August 2018,Temple of Apollo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189484-d232308-Reviews-Temple_of_Apollo-Corinth_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Corinth, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Nice site, very hoot","Nice site to visit. Very hot even though I was there first thing in the morning
