"Great vegetarian restaurant, lots of variety","I would highly recommend this place for a relaxed vegetarian lunch. Nourishing food in big portions, diverse options, friendly staff.

Very interesting area,"Rich in historical interest. Lots of synagogues and a Jewish community centre. Worth doing a guided tour of the area to learn more about its origins and significance. The market square (former slaughter house) holds different markets on different days, so worth perusing through a few visits if you are based nearby.",February 2020,Kazmierz The Former Jewish District,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274772-d282371-Reviews-Kazmierz_The_Former_Jewish_District-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_Southern_Poland.html,"Krakow, Poland",attractions,5.0,4.5

Nice vegetarian dinner for two,"Went here on my first night in Malta with my sister. We are both vegetarian and came in because there was variety in terms of vegetarian options.

Absolutely shocking! Shameful.,"I've been a patron of this pub for many a year and the reason I come back is because of a convenient location and not too busy. However I came here after the opera with my mother to be told I wouldn't be served because ""I looked a bit wobbly"". I was not drunk at all. My explanations amounted to nothing though, it was quite honestly weird.... Maybe I looked a bit glassy eyed? Who knows. But the customer service stinks and I'd avoid this place like the plague!",November 2019,Chandos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1043994-Reviews-Chandos-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Decent quality,"Spanakopita was good, pastry was fresh. Coffee was nice. Prices moderate.

Good area for tourists,This is where I stayed. Good access to other areas of interest in Athens. Walking distance to Acropolis and museums. Gift shops and cafes everywhere. A little overpriced but exactly what you would expect from a tourist area.,October 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Imaginative food,I tried two of the different salads which were both great. The goats cheese beetroot and walnut salad was particularly nice. The chickpea salad was alright. Wine was good.

Amazing Greek food in friendly place,"This might be my favourite Greek food of my trip. Catered well for me as a vegetarian. Courgette frittas, beans, and feta pie all beautiful. Really friendly service as well, they had a lovely dog as well which gets them brownie points from me, as did a panna cota on the house to finish!",October 2019,Filema Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3728594-Reviews-Filema_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Lovely little lake at 15 euro,General admission price 15 euro. You can stay here the whole day. Water temporature stayed 25 degrees. Little fish in the shallow parts.

Super informative,"There was a lot to take in, just from the permanent exhibitions. The Cycladic figures were very interesting, as was the everyday life exhibit and information on the development of different pottery styles over time.

One of my favourite Saturday mornings is a Deptford Market Saturday morning,"You can buy anything and everything! It's vibrant and eclectic and part of our heritige. Proper London Market.

"Overall a fabulous space, lake is problematic","I've been local to the area for 16 years and remember this park as a golf course, the space is so much nicer opened up to the community. Opening out the house properly has been great to see.

The newer bar seems decent, the new cafe seems alright- the old cafe (still there) was a big shambles where you would have to expect your order to be wrong and to have a half hour rate for it - so good they've added more options!

I wanted to try the lake but couldn't because it was 'full'. They said capacity was 100 and that this included those sitting round the edge- which was frustrating as on this occasion I counted only 15 in the water! Seemed punative on a hot day. Then, we noticed the security guards were letting teenage boys in under the fence. It was all a bit hypocritical and haphazard. It also made the situation seem like the staff running things were enjoying rule wielding rather than genuine safety. The fence round the lake clearly isn't right and I hope it is a temporary fix. Lewisham council are going to shape up a bit there.

But that said, a beautiful space the community are clearly loving so far, much more accessible as a park than the previous arrangement.",August 2019,Beckenham Place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2549055-d2633755-Reviews-Beckenham_Place-Beckenham_Greater_London_England.html,"Beckenham, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,3.5
Quirky medical history,"I remember visiting this place as a kid and glad to see it hasn't changed much. As a child I was so fascinated by the herbal cures, smells, and gory facts about early operations. Same things made it a cool place to visit today! Lots of things to read and touch. Beware a narrow staircase to climb to get there.",August 2019,Old Operating Theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d211644-Reviews-Old_Operating_Theatre-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5

Good chippy catering excellently for vegetarians and vegans,"An amazingly extensive menu for vegetarians and vegans, if I lived close Iâ€™d be working my way through it but we had chips, curry sauce, battered mushrooms and a spring roll which was all tasty and huge portions.",July 2019,Shakey Shakey Fish Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186314-d8686877-Reviews-Shakey_Shakey_Fish_Bar-Ramsgate_Isle_of_Thanet_Kent_England.html,"Ramsgate, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0

Independent books,I think this is the same higgledy piggledy independent second hand bookshop which used to be based on the outskirts of Greenwich- now with added coffee and seats! Good move. I like the fact you have to search through the only lightly organised shelves. I also like the fact you can pick up some obscure and rare books here- if you have time to look!,May 2019,Halcyon Books,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d10948194-Reviews-Halcyon_Books-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5

Quality pizza at a cheap price,"Good if you are on a budget. You will get a decent meal for a modest price. Lots of choice. Pizzas come in two standard sizes- smaller circular or long. The smaller one is plenty, or you could get the longer one to share. Local wine served was very drinkable.",May 2019,Pizzeria da Franco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187782-d1537280-Reviews-Pizzeria_da_Franco-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Sorrento, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Nice potato salad,"Only went here once but was very tasty and hospitable. I had potato salad (massive portion - might make a good side to share between 2-3) and local wine, with pistachio cake all of which did not disappoint. Prices were very reasonable but NB they donâ€™t give a lot of detail in their receipts if you are looking to split a bill.

If you donâ€™t want to queue for dinner, arrive before their opening time.",May 2019,La Cantinaccia del Popolo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187782-d7097135-Reviews-La_Cantinaccia_del_Popolo-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Sorrento, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great mix of history, beauty and a swimming spot",When we visited it wasnâ€™t too busy which is lucky as the enclosed area to swim is small- but swimming out to sea is possible depending on weather and current (and ability).

Excellent pizza,"The pizza I had here was hands down the best pizza Iâ€™ve tried. Really good base. Great flavour. Mine had a pesto base but I tried some of a tomato base pizza and both really decent. Would go back and recommend.

"Good, well located hotel to explore the area from","Great pool, good variety at breakfasts (Iâ€™m vegetarian and this wasnâ€™t an issue- the coffee was particularly decent), good size rooms, nice staff.
