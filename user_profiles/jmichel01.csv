Easy take out but seafood dishes were a disappointment,"After a year eating at home, starting my annual review of Restaurants particularly Italian seafood in Myrtle Beach. So far out of 3, Capriccio's is 3rd with Gio's and Caio a close 1 and 2.

First the good points...absolutely fast and easy take out. Ready and picked up in 15 min, though that probably affected the food quality vs. the other places. The warm bread and dipping sauce that came with it and the salad were all excellent. The tirimasu was more like the traditional dish with lady fingers was as good as the other places mentioned as well.

The shrimp scampi and Linguine with clams were both huge portions so you get your money's worth, but if I go back, I'll try a red sauce dish. Very little sauce to begin with and what was there lacked flavor. The clams were ok, but the flavor of the shrimp itself was bad. Perhaps due to the speed of cooking but would not order again.

Do note, if concerned about virus exposure, you walk into a back bar area with no masks present. Staff was pretty well masked up, and you are in and out in a hurry. The restaurant area in the back was empty but don't know about the ventilation.",April 2021,Capriccio's Italian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54359-d21494281-Reviews-Capriccio_s_Italian_Restaurant-Myrtle_Beach_South_Carolina.html,"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Great first meal from this relatively new restaurant,"After taking a year off from my frequent Myrtle Beach Restaurant reviews after a harrowing escape from South America a year ago, we ventured out for our second restaurant meal in a year. With our old favorite now closed, we figured we would try something new. We were not disappointed. The flavors of the seafood pasta dishes were a little different than what you get at other places. Lots of garlic, but roasted vs sauteed. The shrimp and scallops themselves had much better flavor than our recent meal at Ciao. The salad was good, and the tiramisu was huge. It was a take out order that was ready just as we arrived per their estimated time. Would have liked Garlic bread with it like we got a Ciao, but we didn't ask for it either. Service at the door and in ordering was excellent, and the inside of the restaurant looks great and patrons were well spaced out. Several additional items on the menu that we can't wait to check out. Look for future reviews as we cycle through our pre-virus Italian favorites, but for now, I'd give Gio's my #1 pick with Ciao in 2nd place. Forgot to add one thing...though maybe a $1 or 2 more expensive than other restaurants, the portion size was huge so don't let that $ fool you! Got 2 meals for the price of one!",February 2021,Gios Italian Kitchen Myrtle Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54359-d21357301-Reviews-Gios_Italian_Kitchen_Myrtle_Beach-Myrtle_Beach_South_Carolina.html,"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Adventure Falklands was good, but whichever tour agency you use, the North Pond Pengiun Tour is worth the drive.","Though Adventure Falklands were an OK tour group, the review is mostly about the North Pond Penguin tour itself. A long ride from downtown Stanley, mostly on gravel roads, with 15 min of true off roading to get to the Penguins at the beach. Wonderful scenery along the way, with a short stop if interested, at a bombed out Argentine Chinook Helicopter and their ""Shoe Hill"" where locals leaving the island leave a pair of shoes! Beach and surrounding areas were full of GETOO Penguins as the Melagenic Penguins have migrated. Can get very close to thousands and thousands of these penguins, hear them talk, see them fight, etc. There was a stop at the farm house there for a boxed lunch with water and close encounters with several pet sheep. Per the one review, the big sheep don't like the bread, they prefer a salty snack, but the young sheep will eat anything. Watch your fingers! The only complaint we had was that our driver was not very talkative, and didnt tell us much about the island during the whole drive. However, driving 40 km on a winding gravel road requires attention!",March 2020,Adventure Falklands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294272-d2017659-Reviews-Adventure_Falklands-Stanley_East_Falkland.html,"East Falkland, Falkland Islands",attractions,5.0,4.5

This along with the War Memorial and Thatcher Memorial will leave you with a good knowledge of the Falkland Islanders. The Museum is made up of several buildings, some showing old radios, old washing machines, etc. but the main building dedicated to the impacts of the two world wars and the Argentine war.

Horrible check in/out experience in an otherwise nice hotel,"Hate to rate an otherwise ok hotel so low, but the horrible checkout experience drive it. If it was just one thing, no big deal, but it wasn't. It took 30 min to checkout/check in 6 people, with 3 desk clerks. To begin with, the clerks were more interested in talking to people, then checking them in. Then though there was a line at 12 00 check out time, instead of opening another station, one person went to break and their replacement took 5 min to get ready. There was a special hilton honors station with a dedicated person, but when a 2nd Honors person showed up, the other clerk gave them priority over the 4 people waiting in line for 20 min. Then an air crew came in, and they were given priority. It took 1 min to check me out once I got there. Probably could have used the tv, but they tell you not to touch a remote with the virus around. Check in was better but they had no rooms available...said they would call. Came back 3 hours later, no call, and they were handing out keys to new check ins. Really no excuse for inadequate help on one of the busiest days and times, with little concern for the time in line. Finally, they said they would email me my bill as I wasn't going to wait any longer....never got it.",February 2020,Hilton Buenos Aires,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312741-d306891-Reviews-Hilton_Buenos_Aires-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",hotels,1.0,4.5

Walking distances not a real issue if you have trouble walking though. plaza de Mayo, the Cathedral there Boca, San Telmo, Recoleta Cemetery, etc. were all covered.

"Expensive but excellent, but make sure you go to the right one! Near Hilton so short safe walk if staying there","Great option if staying at the Hilton for business or before a cruise. Short 5 minute walk. Open for dinner at earlier hours than most. One watch out...there is a cheaper place called Cabana right next to it. Don't know how that place is but based on the crowds, it's not as good as Cabana Las Lilas. Bread was great though they automatically charge you for it. Nearly everything is a la carte like a Ruth Steak House.

Best option so far in Carolina Forest,"Though I have more places to go, Charlie Graingers so far is my go to lunch place in the area around international drive and river oaks. Cheap eats if you want a hot dog/chips or combo. The Mo Heat hot dog with pimento cheese and jalapenos was awesome, and just the plain dog was excellent as well Lots of other brisket/bbq sandwich options if you want. Coleslaw side was good also, not a lot of mayo or vinegar just right to add hot sauce on. There are coupons in the attractions guide if you want to try it out. Fast and friendly service as well.

"Great people, a couple of tables to sit down, free internet, but just ok food.","Was really hoping that the food would be outstanding since near my house, but was a little disappointed especially with the normal price. Since they have other items on the menu, I'll only comment on the hamburger and grilled chicken sandwich and fries. Both were lost in the giant roll. The roll is huge. Couldn't really taste the hamburger. The Size of the Chicken vs. the roll was a little better, but still overwhelming. Good portion of fries comes with it, fries about half the size of McDonald's to give you a comparison.

They do have hoagies, wraps and cheesesteaks. I'd recommend trying those if you go. There is a great coupon in the local attractions guide (BOGO_, so worth the price with that coupon and it gives you a chance to see for yourself if you like it or not.

Quiet Spot while waiting for a connecting flight..1 hr free with Priority Pass,"Initially wasn't thrilled to see that the only place in CLT and PHL airports that priority pass was good for was their Minute Suites. But since 1 hr comes free, I figured both were worth a shot. Was pleasantly surprised to be able to get a nice quiet rest for an hour, charge my phone and do email on a comfortable couch, as compared to a crowded lounge. Not sure I would pay their normal hourly fee if I had to pay for it but if you are a priority pass member, it's a good deal.

Good Option for dinner before a Carolina Opry show or concert,"With many places closed on Sunday in the off season, there's one place that you can almost bet on being able to come in for dinner around 515 and be out in time to catch the 7 pm show. Just let your server know and order right away. We even had time for dessert and coffee! I have reviewed this Bonefish frequently before with mixed results, and have dropped the rating from 4 to 3. Have had issues with the house salads before and last night was the same. Their Manager came by and when I mentioned it to him, he checked on it an addressed it and let us know which was encouraging that it will be corrected. Broccolli was also way over cooked. None of these are a big deal, but you go to Bonefish for predictable great food, and that has not been the case recently.

If your time is limited...Pick Florence over Pisa,"OK...is Pisa worth a stop? YES. Is a half day tour of Pisa combined with a half day tour of Florence worth it? MAYBE. If you just want to check things off your bucket list but only have a day to do both, then ok, but you will leave with regrets. The half day in Pisa isn't enough if you want to visit the other 2 churches there which I highly recommend. Pisa is more like a tourist trap with thousands of people taking the ridiculous selfies, but again, if that's your thing, you won't be disappointed. Best to spend the whole day here, then a day in Florence if you can. The half day in Florence left us starving for more. So much more to see and do then in Pisa.

"Best to do it with a tour guide, but impressive anyway you go. Lots of Walking, curbs.","Before I say how incredible it is...for those planning on going, expect a lot of walking on uneven surfaces, high curbs, steps, etc. We saw two people fall during our tour. Depending on your situation, you'll want to spend at least 3 hours at the site for refreshments so grab a water bottle before you enter.

This is a must see if visiting Naples. If on a cruise, it's about a 35 min bus ride. You'll be able to see everything with a good tour guide, but it will be fast paced. A lot of people believe that it was inundated with lava vs ash and hot gas and are astonished to see this very well preserved and excavated intact city. The city square is amazing. Plus in the background is the ""bad boy"" volcano that created the carnage and you have to wonder will it happen again. Outside of the park there are places to get souveniers and drinks. Some of the stores offer free tastes of Lemoncello and other local alcoholic liquors. Try the Lemoncello Creme for something you won't find else ware! If on a cruise, one annoying thing about the cruise port is that even though you could walk right up to your ship, you have to go inside a building, up stairs, pass by shops, then go back down to access your cruise ship.

My standard rating criteria is summarized below:

Atmosphere..Nice. Roomy, Quiet, Background music. Liked that better than my top rated place
Service..also very good though hard to tell as it wasn't crowded.
House wines were good, prices at $6 per glass was good, though pours smaller than my number 2 favorite
House salad and dressing...only two dressing choices and they weren't great. 3rd out of 3
Overall dinner quality and portion size. were ok. Overall 3rd out of 3, but the Neptune Platter was right up there with my #1 favorite, and their red meat sauce was also good. Very close to #2
Dessert...I only rate the Tiramisu and I would rate it #1!
Finally, meal pricing...$2-$3 LESS then my top choices and they have a good deal with the international dining club.
Menu selection: #1 assuming they are all good. Some unique combinations that other places don't have.
Bread...so so. Was hot/warm, but the garlic was a little thick on just one side, so that didn't help the review.
Overall...worth the visit. Good on price, great on dessert, great on service and atmosphere, but just ok on food. My #1 is Luigi's. My current # 2 is Vine Bistro",January 2020,Ramando's Italian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54359-d436203-Reviews-Ramando_s_Italian_Restaurant-Myrtle_Beach_South_Carolina.html,"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"A drive by on the way Our Lady of the Rock, but a great story","If you are going to our Lady of the Rock, you'll take the boat by the island.

Worth it if you have the time...good combination with Old town Kotar for a cruise tour,"Historical with a great history, the two islands off of Perast are worth seeing with an actual stop at Our Lady of the Rock. There is a small church on the artificial island that was built many many years ago. The art, decorations and mini museum pieces give you another perspective of European history along with great views of the local hills and mountains. It's a short boat ride over and back. You want a guided tour to get the full history and background.

Highlight of our Adiratic cruise,"A wonderful stop. 5 minutes after leaving your cruise ship, you go back in time 500 years or more. Worth a guided tour to hear the history including why Kotor and many other Adriatic stops have so many Cats! It has to do with witches, rats and the plague!

Main entrance to the walled city by the cruise port,"Best place to go into the city. On occasion during heavy rain, wind and waves it can be flooded and they put up elevated walkways to enter.

Like going back in time....historically old city with modern shops and restaurants,"One of the better cruise ports on the Med. The walled city is the highlight but my other reviews cover some great places to go just a few miles from the city, AND if you arrive by cruise during the day or leave in daylight, the passage is fantastic with close in Mountains on either side. Give yourself at least 2 hours to walk the walled city once, then hit the shops, restaurants next. Like many places in the med, there are cats everywhere so bring some cat snacks with you! They have awesome Cat ceramic statues that go on a shelf or fireplace mantle that are really unique.

One of the top stops on our cruise,"It's like going back in time when you walk into the walled city. It's also a sad reminder of the state of the world still after all of the centuries when the city was started that it was severely damaged not that long ago in the Balkan Wars. Reconstruction is still going on. Take the time to see the monastery, walk the water front, and check out the stores. This was a key part of the Game of Thrones sets!

Nice stop on a cruise tour,"Family winery where they sit you down on tables, and allow you to taste PLENTY of wine at your table, 2-3 different kinds, fruit, snacks, etc. as they explain their history, the wine making process, etc. If you like wine, and lots of it, it's a great stop!

"Great cajun chicken sandwich, good size, little pricey though.","If you never have been to a fuddruckers, here's what you need to know. You enter the place and go to the first station to order your food, and a soft drink. If you want a shake or beer, it looks like you need to go to either the shake station or beer station just down from the food station. You then pick a seat and they fairly fast bring your food to you. The sandwich comes bare...they have a station with lettuce, tomatoes, jalapenos, pico de gallo, etc that you then add on your self. The cajun chicken sandwich was juicy, good size, well seasoned on a nice role. The sandwich was $7 and the drink was $2.25. Food was ready in about 6 minutes. Nice atmosphere, friendly service. When you are done, you just leave you plate on the table. Nice location not far from the ocean or the convention center.",January 2020,Fuddruckers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54359-d436139-Reviews-Fuddruckers-Myrtle_Beach_South_Carolina.html,"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"My # 1 for value, My # 1 for service, and my #2 for food for Italian Seafood in MB","Perfect place to have my New Year's eve dinner. As usual, service and speed to table was amazing even though the place was the busiest that I've seen it all year. For a table of 2, we were seated, served, and finished dinner and out the door in an hour. That's why I highly recommend Vine for Pre-show/Pre-Concert dinners at either the Alabama T. or Carolina Opry. Dinner prices are comparable to other places except house wine at $4 with a generous pour can't be beaten. There are plenty of options for discounted meals from the Ritz Book, Restaurant.com, the IDC book and now Vine has their own $10 off text club. When you add those discounts, it truly is the value place to go. Their fresh bread, salads and desserts are excellent. Entrees are good as well, equal to almost anywhere else, it's just one special at another Italian place just down the street that keeps Vine from being tops for my food quality as well. Their sauces for the pasta's etc are just not quite as good as my #1 place. So all in all, I end 2019 with Vine being tied with Luigi's all things considered as my preferred place to go. I'll be trying out some additional Italian places in the months ahead as I start a new year of reviews.",December 2019,Vine Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54359-d12331906-Reviews-Vine_Bistro-Myrtle_Beach_South_Carolina.html,"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Good food, OK prices, large beer selection","One of the better seafood places I've been to in the Myrtle Beach/Murrels inlet area. Reservations recommended though on a Friday night,the 630 to 730 pm window seemed to be pretty good to get a table. Nice fresh rolls, affordable good side salad, reasonably priced entrees, drinks maybe $1-$2 higher than other affordable places, and some great desserts. Service was excellent and acceptably fast. For locals, there are TWO great options for you in 2020 to save $ during certain times of the year. Both the Ritz Book and the International Dining Club have great BOGO deals. Can pay for either book after just two great meals at the Hot Fish Club!",December 2019,Hot Fish Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54358-d436140-Reviews-Hot_Fish_Club-Murrells_Inlet_South_Carolina.html,"Murrells Inlet, South Carolina",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great lunch on the way to Mt Etna,"Though it was a cruise tour lunch stop, the food was excellent. It is part of a resort, so my assumption is that it is open to the public as well. The meal was one of the best land meals we had on our whole trip. Multiple courses, wine, dessert, and expresso at the end.

Outdoor and indoor seating","Though open to the public all the time, if there is a cruise ship in, good bet that it will be packed with people for lunch as it is a ""cruise ship tour lunch stop"". Basic food was ok. As we were with a tour, it was a fixed menu. Service was fast considering the number of people there. Nice view of the harbor, and there is a really old church next store that may/may not be open, but if it is, it's worth a stop. Like anywhere in Greece, there are lots of cats around.

Still my #1 for food in Myrtle Beach,"Looks like baring a late surprise, Luigi's will once again come in as my #1 place to eat in MYR for 2019. Bread, Salad, Entree's, Dessert, are all # 1 or # 2 overall in my many reviews. Wine price, glass size and overall atmosphere are #2 or #3 overall though they do have my favorite wind Lambrusco, but I struggle to pay for one glass for what I can buy 2 bottles for! Their ""special"" which I think is on there every single day, the seafood trio in a lobster sauce on risotto is definitely my overall top entree for the year!

One of several old buildings and churches on the main town road,"There are several ""do not miss"" churches and old buildings as you walk through the City. Most are free and open to the public. Taormina is basically a small town with one main street that takes about 30 min ""nonstop"" to walk through. The highlight is the further point away from the Central car park which is the greek / roman theatre. I'd suggest 'visually site seeing"" to the theatre, spend 30 min there, then work your way back stopping a the Doumo and other churches along the way. 5-10 min is enough time at each church with 30 min minimum at the theatre.

Worth the drive but dress for it!,"Great tour opportunity to get to the 6000 ft mark of Mt Etna. Pass through old and newer lava flows, get to see a ""cold crater"" and if lucky, get to see mini eruptions from the summit itself. Seems to be safe as well. Most tours will take you to the staging point on top for an hour or so. Was 68 when we left the base, and 29 deg up top with a windchill of 22 deg F in November and snow covered.
