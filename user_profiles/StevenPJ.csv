Excellent,We were in Santorini during off peak season and were so lucky to find this place. We were unaware that reservations were needed and were so grateful to the the staff for working us in. The food here was some of the best we had in Greece and the atmosphere had a cool and relaxed vibe. I would recommend eating here twice! The feta balls are not to be missed.,March 2020,Kokkalo Fagopoteion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635607-d6839280-Reviews-Kokkalo_Fagopoteion-Firostefani_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great little hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights. Rooms were sufficient, who is really in Santorini to stay inside? The views are beautiful and breakfast was plentiful. We stayed during off peak season so it was a bit of a walk to find open restaurants. Even so I would stay here again.",March 2020,Sunset Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635607-d618362-Reviews-Sunset_Hotel-Firostefani_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
AMAZING,The Agora is absolutely a must with the temple being the highlight. It is astonishing to see such a complete structure from thousands of years ago.

If you have time,If you have extra time the stadium is worth the visit but I would not go out of my way to see it. The audio guide is worth listening to as you walk the path around the site.

Does this need a review?,It is pretty obvious that most people visit Athens to see this sight so there is not much more I can add.

Must see,A must see after you visit the Acropolis! The collection of statues with visible paint really transforms the image of ancient Athens. You must also walk through the excavations under the museum.
