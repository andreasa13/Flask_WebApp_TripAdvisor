amazing view,"The view from these terrace was just amazing. I enjoyed all, we come just for drink, but even the food around looked delicious... The atmosphere there is just unbelievable... The service was really kind and useful, but for me was winning the view of Prague. Warning if you go there close to sunset you can easily get in love;). I can truly recommend this place",April 2019,Restaurace Slunecni terasa T-Anker,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d4606565-Reviews-Restaurace_Slunecni_terasa_T_Anker-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",restaurants,5.0,3.5
