Acrópolis,The combo ticket for 30 euros gives you access to all 7 of the ancient ruins sites over the course of 5 days so it’s a great value. The ticket cost to just one site is 10 euros. Lots of walking and lots of stairs to climb but so much beautiful scenery everywhere. Wear your most comfortable walking shoes and clothes. We managed to see all 7 sites in 2 days.,November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
