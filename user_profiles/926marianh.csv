Startlingly impressive,"My trip to the blue lagoon was on Tuesday January 7, 2020. great feeling, you must feel it to understand how awesome it is. the temperature of the water is perfect, it's a must see/feel when you visit Iceland. it's worth all the fuse, musk, dink, and towel comes with the comfort entry fee (pre-book), I wouldn't go for the premium, it makes no difference, you don't need a pair of slippers, you can go bare footed and the towel is just fine. the feel of the water is what you don't wanna miss.",January 2020,Blue Lagoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608874-d207805-Reviews-Blue_Lagoon-Grindavik_Reykjanes_Peninsula.html,"Grindavik, Iceland",attractions,5.0,4.5

Great experience,"We had a great tour guide that took us into the town of old Jaffa. We started the tour from the clock tower and made our way into the old town. THE TOUR WAS TOTALLY FREE!!!

Great history,Went to Egypt under Jakarda tours. It was very informative and interesting trip to embark on. The history behind the pyramids are great. The private tour is budget friendly and very convenient. The sunset at the pyramid restaurant was amazing.

Great place,"A day trip from montegobay, by the time we got there it was pouring. I didn't enjoy the place like I wanted but when the rain finally stopped, we got the chance to see a beautiful sunset.

Phenomenal,"Very friendly people. Phenomenal way of living. Even a three year old can swim in the big water body. It's cheaper to go and in groups. We took a bike ride to the water and a boat ride to the village. A round trip cost about 55gh per person but 20gh if in a group of 10. It's about 2hrs drive from takoradi. There are side attractions on the way. It was a day well spent. Oh, and don't forget to make a donation to the locals. It could be cash or in kind.",March 2019,Nzulezo Stilt Village Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1489848-d2552006-Reviews-Nzulezo_Stilt_Village_Tour-Beyin_Western_Region.html,"Beyin, Ghana",attractions,5.0,3.5
Great experience,Riding on the horse in the ocean was great. It just wasn't lengthy. We were in and out real fast. They took us in groups of about 10 persons per ocean trip. We had the opportunity to ride the horses on the mountain top but that was more like a training. I'd rather we spent more time in the ocean.,August 2018,CHUKKA Ocean Outpost at Sandy Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1444478-d657317-Reviews-CHUKKA_Ocean_Outpost_at_Sandy_Bay-Sandy_Bay_Hanover_Parish_Jamaica.html,Jamaica,attractions,4.0,4.5
