No longer suitable for people with nut allergies,"Apologies if this has been made clear elsewhere but I haven’t seen it yet: Alachi is no longer suitable for those of us with nut allergies.

Yesterday evening I went in to celebrate my grandad’s birthday and was told I can’t eat anything as all the pans are coated in peanut oil. Apparently the health inspector made them aware that this is not alright - no comment. Anyway, I ended up eating at Odd Bottle across the road as they are always extremely friendly and accommodating.

Just thought it was important to mention in case anyone with a nut allergy plans on continuing to visit/order from Alachi.",February 2020,Alachi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186317-d2518590-Reviews-Alachi-Kingston_upon_Hull_East_Riding_of_Yorkshire_England.html,"Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.5

Truly Wonderful,"The Acropolis Museum has to be one of the best history museums and art galleries in the world. Everything is so well restored and taken care of, and the staff are incredibly helpful. If you're in Athens, you absolutely must take some time out to visit here!",September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Overpriced & Underwhelmed,"There's no denying that this place looks gorgeous, but it became clear as soon as we were seated (next to the bins) that this place had little else to offer. The staff were rude and inattentive, barely acknowledging me when I said I had a nut allergy and pretty much just chucking our plates on the table. It was clear that other tourists were being treated extremely well, leaving the rest of us to be ignored - maybe my partner and I didn't look wealthy enough? Honestly, we only went here as it was late at night and we were tired of walking but don't make the same mistake we made and walk a little bit further to find much better places to spend your time and money!",September 2019,Diogenes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1880932-Reviews-Diogenes-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,3.0
Lack of Consideration for Allergies,"I would highly recommend that anyone with a nut allergy avoid Le Pain Quotidien in Bruges. The restaurant and staff are absolutely lovely, and I was warned about there being nuts in the kitchen (like everywhere), but after eating some of my Caesar salad I spent all afternoon very ill.

As I had never been to Bruges before and had arrived by boat, so had no where to return to once the reaction began, it was a bit of a nightmare. I cannot blame the waitress as she did her best, but there absolutely has to be more consideration in the kitchen. Basically, if you have any food allergy you may want to eat elsewhere. Like at the McDonald's where I spent the rest of my afternoon being a burden to the cleaning staff.",November 2017,Le Pain Quotidien,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188671-d1872118-Reviews-Le_Pain_Quotidien-Bruges_West_Flanders_Province.html,"Bruges, Belgium",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Always Fantastic,My family and I often eat at Hessle Tandoori.
