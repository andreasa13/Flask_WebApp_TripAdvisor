All good,"Conveniently located on the highway this proved a great spot to stop on my way back to the CC for lunch. The Dancing Chicken with Lemon was excellent with generous, tender chicken accompanied by a wonderful mix of greens and salad. Beautiful flavours in the delicately lemoned chicken and the balsamic dressing was perfect. Fascinating collection of artificial flowers that normally I'd rather not be used, but these were top class replicas to the point of having to touch the pink flowing gum blossom to check whether fresh or otherwise. They do have some larger tables as well as more intimate ones available and cool water was delivered to the table with the menu.

Mixed review,"The foyer is tasteful and generous in proportions. Our room was just adequate for 2 single ladies and our luggage, but was clean and comfortable. Plastic cups in bathroom with no, tissues, conditioner or moisturiser and the bath flooded the bathroom floor if you fully opened the drain plug after having a bath.

Breakfast was excellent and the room very comfortable. My only negatives that stopped being given 5* was the fact they do not provide facial tissues in the bedroom and don't restock the tea in your room after check-in but charge €4 for an extra teabag. I thought this a bit mean and penny pinching. The other issue if you had mobility problems was you have to negotiate 6 or so stairs to get to the main entrance and lobby from the lift.

Poor service ok food,"I waited across the road in their seaside seating area for 10mins and still no sign of staff. I wanted to use the WC so crossed the road and waited at the counter for someone to acknowledge my presence but before they did I saw the sign to the WC. Walked upstairs to find you needed a code so walked back down to the counter and still no one addressed me. I asked if I may have the code please and a gentlemen still didn't make eye contact but gave me a bit of paper and pointed to the code. I asked if I may have a table upstairs also and he answered 'yes'. After using the facilities I sat at a table upstairs for 20mins and was just about to walk downstairs when a gentleman came up to the storeroom and I asked him if I may place an order. He yelled back downstairs and within 2 minutes another gent came up and took my order. The crepe was fine but they have a picture of one with strawberries, but obviously never available, only banana. I asked for a refill of water but it wasn't attended to. No one came near me again after delivering the crepe so I went downstairs to pay at the counter.

Once the food was delivered no one came near me for over an hour except when I'd asked the waitress for a water refill. Eventually I asked for sweets of a waiter nearby who took my order somehow without making eye contact at all and it took another 25 minutes for the fruit salad and yoghurt to be delivered.

Fine and the only way up if you've already walked Ks.,"The walk to the bottom of the funicular is up many stairs so I was happy to get the funicular up but wish I'd walked back but had already paid for a return ticket. €7.50 seems a bit expensive but I suppose it is 2 way. The ticket lady at the bottom is not so friendly as was the gentleman at the top. Not well signposted at either end and no one communicates when the next one will leave. I wish I'd read the post warning about the taxi drivers at the base as I too was charged €20 for a €10 job and not dropped at my hotel but a block down a hill with him siting ""no parking at hotel.""

The green salad with mushrooms was excellent and the salmon cutlet was very good though the accompanied sautéed eggplant and zucchini was very mushy. Generous servings for both dishes and they happily gave me take away packages for both. It was a litre of still water bought when asking for plain water. This, with a green tea all came to €42.70.

Superb food with a view to match,"I'd walked a good part of the morning around the nearby archeological sites so lunch was a welcome rest. Friendly reception allowed me to take the table of my choice and a menu was produced. I had the penne pasta with mushrooms and thought it perfect with al dente pasta, generous mushrooms and chicken in the cheesiest sauce and beautifully balanced with not too much or too little. I was then going to indulge in the Zonars Special desert but was warned it was really meant for two so settled for the tart which was an exquisite shortcrust pastry, fruit and vanilla cream flan. It wasn't the cheapest meal but well worth every Euro. The view to the Acropolis and Theatre of Dionysus was excellent. Service was outstanding.",November 2019,Dionysos Zonar's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1061815-Reviews-Dionysos_Zonar_s-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Worked well for me,"I did the three tours in the 48 hours given on my ticket and found all three helpful, informative and convenient. The city tour helped orientate me and give me an overview of the various sites I wanted to revisit. The beach or purple route was delightful and showed a very different Athens. I hopped off at Glyfada and had lunch and did some shopping. It rained heavily as I was waiting for my return bus to Athens so I hopped a taxis and it was held up significantly by traffic when we got closer to the city centre. This is hardly the buses fault. The green route showed Piraeus, Lion's Gate and the shipping terminals which was a very different part of the area again. The commentary was clearly audible and worked in every seat of the 6-8 I sat in and was helpful and informative and the bus driver announced each stop as we approached. I felt it was a well worthwhile means of first intro to a fascinating city.",November 2019,City Sightseeing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2021235-Reviews-City_Sightseeing-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
So many significant ruins,Athens is so rich in archeological sites one tends to think 'oh just another pile of stones'. I found it interesting to just walk around and soak up the ancient history in yet another significant site. Such a sophisticated and advanced culture in an ancient world.,November 2019,Temple of Olympian Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242844-Reviews-Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Fascinating,"Thankfully I wasn't shopping for anything in particular as I visited on a Sunday afternoon and the whole area was packed. Walking anywhere was extremely slow & I became a little anxious regarding the opportunity for pick pockets etc. Nothing happened, I'm just not fond of pressing crowds. I did buy an Icecream which was pretty awesome, particularly the pistachio flavour. Glad I got to check it out but won't be rushing back particularly on a Sunday.",November 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Not disappointing in any way,Impressive in real life. To be actually able to walk the Acropolis and circumnavigate the Parthenon is truly awesome. Worth Avery dollar of the entry fee and good to see ongoing work in the restoration and preservation of this ancient history. A good workout while experiencing some fabulous history.,November 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Awesome,To see it in real life and walk the climb to the top and around so many ancient stone ruins was very moving for me. Truly a must do for the ancient history buff and unless you want to research it yourself I recommend a guided tour to get the most out of the experience. Be prepared for crowds and wear stable good walking shoes as quite uneven walkways. Not suitable for wheelchairs and difficult for anyone with mobility issues.,November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent all round,"I had the rocket, mushroom, walnut and Parmesan cheese. It was a very generous serving with just the right amount of balsamic glaze dressing. Service was friendly and fast and a complimentary small jar of Icecream followed. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Very good value at E6.90. Handy to shops and across the road from the beach.",October 2019,Laos kai Kalamaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g562630-d7626181-Reviews-Laos_kai_Kalamaki-Glyfada_Attica.html,"Glyfada, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good transit hotel,"Close to the airport with a shuttle bus half hourly, this hotel is very convenient and well located for a stop between flights. I arrived roughly 1000 and only had to wait for an hour and half for a comfortable and quiet room in which I was able to catch up on some very needed sleep. Most of the staff were friendly but the odd one is off handed and give you the impression you are putting them out if you have a request. Comfortable clean bed and wonderful shower or bath were appreciated.",October 2019,Le Passage Cairo Hotel & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294201-d301746-Reviews-Le_Passage_Cairo_Hotel_Casino-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Cairo, Egypt",hotels,4.0,4.5
Friendly staff welcomed me,Friendly staff welcomed me and served well. I enjoyed the quinoa salad which was fresh and tasty. The chocolate & nut cake with icecream was generous in portion and tasty enough.

1st room appalling but 2nd room better,"I arrived at 0300 so was glad to be shown to any room I could lie down in. Both single beds the bed linen was rumpled and there was hair on the sheet when I folded the top layer back. I don’t believe the linen had been changed. The bath tub had a scum ring, the carpet was dirty particularly around the edges & so on. I was too tired to not lie down and by the time I addressed the situation in the morning I had at least 23 different points that needed addressing. The new room they gave me was considerably better but the cleanliness and housekeeping was still patchy.",October 2019,Barcelo Cairo Pyramids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294202-d1503662-Reviews-Barcelo_Cairo_Pyramids-Giza_Giza_Governorate.html,"Giza, Egypt",hotels,2.0,4.0
Most enjoyable,"This was an optional extra with our river cruise & I can highly recommend this. Our captain was informative and the crew were extremely skilled at navigating around other feluccas, cruise ships and fisherman. The crew were very friendly without being invasive and helpful boarding & disembarking. Loved the whole experience and found it very peaceful and scenic as we skirted Elephantine Island and returned.",October 2019,Aswan Felucca Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294204-d1758983-Reviews-Aswan_Felucca_Tours-Aswan_Aswan_Governorate_Nile_River_Valley.html,"Aswan, Egypt",attractions,5.0,4.5
