Relaxing weekend,We been before to Camber Sands but never overstayed ..weather was beautiful and food lovely ..We loved because you can walk miles to a nice sandy beach and you just heard the waves crushing to the rocks at the same time crying child or boys just laughing or playing .Is a family point but it does get crowded in high season ..cughe for ice creams and burguers .toilets and parking can be hassle but overall we had a nice weekend .

"""Excellent location ""","Hotel was nice . Rooms clean and tidy every day , Breakfast was very good. The bar completely dead. Very good location with transports and places to visit like the TV TOWER. But I found the staff very arrogant and not helpful at all despite they speak perfectly English . I was out all day and my phone battery run out and I need it to made a phone call and I ask the receptionist if I could just charge my phone for few minutes because it was urgent and he replied no,, so then he changed his mind and offered the hotel phone but I said I need to check the number etc. at the end he did it but he wasn't happy . I found this hotel with a bunch of rude kids in reception. Apart from this incident was pleasant to stay . But I wouldn't come back again.",January 2016,H4 Hotel Berlin Alexanderplatz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187323-d1857196-Reviews-H4_Hotel_Berlin_Alexanderplatz-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",hotels,3.0,4.0
