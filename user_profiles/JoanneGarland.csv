Gluten-free fish with no flavor at all.,"We ordered scrod, prepared gluten-free. Our view of the harbor was pleasant. We were each served a piece of fish baked in a HOT porcelain dish. It had no flavor whatsoever. The steamed vegetables were perfect, the fries excellent. As for the fish, it tasted like plain unembellished tofu. This cook could use a dose of culinary imagination.",April 2021,Brax Landing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41601-d384750-Reviews-Brax_Landing-Harwich_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html,"Harwich, Massachusetts",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Breathtaking,"Having driven over the bridge occasionally over the years, we had never stopped to enjoy the gorge. This time we planned a day trip, with some hiking.

We found breathtaking views from the bridge, which we walked several times, then took a 0.4 mile trail south, downhill to the bottom of the gorge, and came back up.

The trail is broad and gentle, easy for anyone who likes to walk (we’re 74 and fit). Along the way there are occasional benches for rest, and places to view the gorge from the safety of a chain link fence above it. The surrounding woods are peaceful.

At the bottom, one can scramble down to the rocky gorge base, wade in the water, and enjoy the sunshine.

Additional trails go off to the north, and in the other side of the bridge one can walk 100 yards to the Nature Center and its Canopy Walk, but we will save that venture for another day.",October 2020,Quechee Gorge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57371-d104261-Reviews-Quechee_Gorge-Quechee_Hartford_Vermont.html,"Quechee, Vermont",attractions,5.0,4.5
A true joy.,"When we planned a day trip to Quechee we sought a lovely restaurant for lunch. Simon Pearce became our clear choice, but it required advance reservations, and the on-line system had no slots available for another week. Then we called the restaurant directly, 24 hours in advance, and found an available table. (Even after we arrived there, the couple ahead of us cancelled their own reservation and opted for take-out, so there is always hope.)

We found the restaurant sunny and beautiful, above the waterfall, in a restored old mill building, in rooms adjacent to a showroom that glittered with glass on display.

Our gluten-free needs were met with ease. We enjoyed hot rolls, outstanding butternut squash bisque, and leg of duck atop collard greens flavored with bacon, pearl onions, and a delicious creamy sauce.

Lunch was a joy, truly lovely.",October 2020,Simon Pearce,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57371-d518028-Reviews-Simon_Pearce-Quechee_Hartford_Vermont.html,"Quechee, Vermont",restaurants,5.0,4.5
What a lovely discovery! And gluten-free as well.,"What a lovely discovery! For lunch we were ushered to a table at sunny front window, in a room with a high ceiling and well-spaced tables. (Outdoor dining was also an option.) We ordered the cod, prepared gluten-free, with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Oh my! The potatoes were outstanding, the fish was done perfectly, and the abundant broccoli arrived bright green and hot. Our meal was colorful, delicious, and plentiful. For dessert my friend ordered crème brûlée, which turned out to be a large serving, accompanied by a huge dollop of whipped cream. She was delighted! The Duck is a perfect place to find a good, hot, tastefully prepared meal (with plenty of vegetables).",September 2020,The Duck,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41854-d1372307-Reviews-The_Duck-Sturbridge_Massachusetts.html,"Sturbridge, Massachusetts",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Gluten-free whole-belly fried clams!!!,"Gluten-free whole-belly fried clams? Abundant! We had heard about this place and tried it while on vacation. Wow! We even returned the next night for GF fried fish and coleslaw. They had outdoor seating available away from the building, and my dining companion could get her glass of wine on the way to it. Two issues were disappointing. I picked up our tray at the window and carried it some distance to the outdoor seating, during which time a breeze cooled our meals more than we would wish. We sat down to eat, only to realize that our tray held no napkins, utensils, or salt and pepper—apparently customers need to ask for such items before leaving the window. Second, the credit card paperwork, which required no signature, had no option to pay a tip, which on a $70 check would be significant. There were tip buckets for cash, but many people don’t carry much cash anymore. Finally, we appreciated the cashier’s suggestion that we could order a small portion of clams or fish, as my friend has a tiny appetite and found the smaller amount worked better for her.

Sweet Hotel,"This hotel was selected by our travel agent and was comfortable, with a great sea view from both our balcony and the breakfast room. Our room air conditioner proved pesky at first, but staff from the front desk stayed with it and got it to work. Traffic noise from out front was eliminated by closing the balcony door. Breakfast was great! We tried to use the rooftop hot tub but found its (European standard) temperature of about 84°F. cold! We had hoped it would be closer to (American standard) 100°F. and were disappointed.

Outstanding Travel Agency!,"A friend and I just returned from an amazing two weeks in Greece, the centerpiece being two days in and near Athens and four nights on a cruise to Greek islands and a port in Turkey. Separately we had arranged our own flights and hotels for the beginning and the end of our vacation, but in between we placed ourselves in the capable hands of Fantasy Travel of Athens. What a great decision! I had harbored concerns in advance about dealing with a travel agent who is so far away, but I trusted the reviews I saw on line and went ahead and booked. Well, right from the beginning all of my questions were answered promptly, the itinerary included exactly what we wanted, and the price was perfect. We were met at the Athens airport by an agent and driver, really nice young men (who chatted with each other in English as a courtesy to us!), were driven straight to our very beautiful hotel on the waterfront, and given our travel vouchers. After breakfast the next morning a taxi driver picked us up and drove us to the meeting place for our (G.O. Tours) tour bus. Ditto on the following day for our all-day trip to Delphi. On the third day a taxi drove us to the port and connected us with a Fantasy Travel rep, who led us through the ship’s embarkation process. On our massive ship we met passengers from all over the world, on a truly fine cruise. Upon disembarkation at the cruise’s end, we were met once again by a Fantasy Travel rep, who accompanied us back to the airport and escorted us to the meeting place for our continued journey on our own. At each step, Fantasy Travel had arranged every detail and we found ourselves in capable, professional hands. I can’t say enough about this fine travel agency. If there are particular things you want to see and do in Greece, whether as a sole traveler, a couple, or a group, get in touch with them on line and have them make your arrangements. They can be trusted to deliver, to take very good care of you, and to escort you through every potentially confusing step from start to finish. We are most satisfied with our experience with Fantasy Travel!!!!!",October 2019,Fantasy Travel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2442390-Reviews-Fantasy_Travel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Dream of a Lifetime,"On a stunning October morning we climbed to this ancient place. The crowds were moderate and consisted mostly of younger people. One has to be in reasonable shape to climb so many steps, most without handrails. At the top the view is magnificent, though footing is uneven and tricky over the rocky surface. A hiking pole is useful, as is someone’s arm to hang onto.

Where’s the Meat?,"We stopped in here for a late lunch, impressed by the Trip Advisor logo at the entrance. Seated outdoors, we ordered lamb chops, which came with rice OR salad. The “chops” turned out to be more like spare ribs, tasty but short on meat. They were almost entirely bone and fat! When a meal costs 13 euro, one should expect more than a trace of meat inside all that fat.

Perfect for a Lovely Splurge After Church,"We have had a difficult time finding a restaurant where we could splurge a bit after church. Most of the really nice places don't open until 4 PM, leaving us with few options beyond chain establishments, Italian ones, or Chinese. We are so pleased to have discovered Slainte.

It was a hot day and we arrived early for our 1 PM reservation, opting to sit outside under large umbrellas on the deck. The famed view eluded us, obscured by rapidly growing sumac. No matter, we were there for a leisurely meal and a long, quiet conversation.

And we enjoyed exactly that, ordering mussels, followed by the lamb shank with roasted root vegetables. Everything was done to perfection. We appreciated the gluten-free menu and the care that our server took to be sure she understood whatever level of dietary strictness we needed. She remained attentive but did not rush us or interrupt our focused visit with each other. We had plenty of time to enjoy ourselves.

The menu at Slainte is not for the budget-minded, but we were there to take our time and splurge. It was so nice to have the opportunity to do so.",June 2018,Slainte,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41614-d4291246-Reviews-Slainte-Holyoke_Massachusetts.html,"Holyoke, Massachusetts",restaurants,5.0,3.5
"Rigorous Climb, but Worth It","While staying in Pompeii for four nights, I wanted to climb Mt. Vesuvius. The local tourist office had several bus departures each day, so I made a reservation for the following morning for €20 and paid an additional €10 on the bus for a ticket to the climbing trail. People of all ages and from all over the world climbed the trail that morning. We were asked to return to the bus in about 90 minutes. At 71, I have to move more slowly than that. I used a pair of trekking poles (which I had bought on line and which collapsed to fit into my carry-on luggage). They were very helpful. The trail is wide and not steep, but it is a relentless climb. Good footwear is essential, as small loose stones make slipping all too easy. Benches are positioned at many switchbacks, and they are most welcome. Two or three souvenir stands on the trail sell bottled beverages, but don't plan on finding a restroom up on the trail. Eventually one passes several places on the left to peer into the crater, and if it is a clear day, one can see the world spread out below to the right. Hikers a day earlier saw only white mist, but I was treated to a magnificent view all the way to the Amalfi Coast. I also picked up a mild sunburn. The return hike required careful stepping, due to small loose stones. There was no way I could do the entire round-trip hike in 90 minutes at my age. I reached the trail bottom three hours late, confident that I could board one of the later buses, which I could. If that had not been possible, I was assured that public buses ran regularly into Pompeii for only a few euro. The hiking trail is appropriate for all ages but is not for anyone who is frail or weak or has heart trouble. Some people brought their lunch and their dogs. I met lovely people from all over the world, and I found the experience to be well worth the effort.",May 2018,Vesuvius vs. Pompeii Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187785-d1652606-Reviews-Vesuvius_vs_Pompeii_Tours-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Fascinating Excavation,"While staying in Pompeii for several days, I took advantage of the bus that runs several times a day from the tourist information offices to Vesuvius and Herculaneum. Reservations are recommended, and the cost is €20. Admission fee to Herculaneum, payable on arrival, is an additional €11. The excavation site lies in a broad pit that is accessed by modern walkways. One can easily tour the entire site in an hour. The buildings are in a better state of preservation than those at Pompeii, because they were encased in mud rather than ash. Much of Herculaneum remains to be excavated, because modern buildings have been erected on the land above. Still, a visit to Herculaneum is worth the time. If you take the tourist bus from Pompeii, it will probably climb Mt. Vesuvius first, to drop off hikers at the base of the trail to the crater. This is a good way to take a look at the trail and decide whether or not to embark on that hike on another day. That was what I did, and it was a good choice.",May 2018,Parco Acheologico di Ercolano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g670330-d195507-Reviews-Parco_Acheologico_di_Ercolano-Ercolano_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Ercolano, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5

What's more, there's a large American flag displayed on the wall behind the counter. How's that for helping Americans feel at home?

Fascinating and Outstanding,"When I was nine years old I read the story of Pompeii and I have wanted to visit it ever since. Now I am a 71-year-old lady. I bought a plane ticket, booked a room, and took off for three full days in Pompeii. First of all, just go up to one of the three entrance gates, get in line, and pay your 15 Euros for a ticket. You will probably be handed a map and a guidebook. From there you will be hard pressed to see the entire place in one day. The footing is tricky and uneven, so good walking shoes are essential. A trekking pole is useful as well. Some people hire a guide, while others rent an audio guide (8 Euros) from a local tourist office. Still more people have downloaded a Rick Steeves audio file and listen to it as they walk. Carry water, and don't expect restrooms anywhere except near the entrance gates. The size and scope of this archaeological site will boggle your mind. Take in what you can, use the map to find the locations that you really want to see, and know that you won't be able to see everything in one visit. Whatever you can see will be worth your while.",May 2018,Pompeii Archaeological Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187786-d195477-Reviews-Pompeii_Archaeological_Park-Pompeii_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Pompeii, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best Location!,"Location is this hotel's primary asset, as it is situated an easy walk from both the FCO terminal and car rental return 2nd floor garage areas. Use the elevated walkway from the departures level, enjoy at least four moving walkways to the corridor's end, take the elevator to ground level, and step out directly in front of the Hilton. No shuttle bus needed.

This hotel is a fine edifice with a beautiful marble lobby and comfortable seating as well as a business center for printing your boarding pass. Staff is courteous, helpful, and caring. Fellow guests included several clusters of international flight attendants, stunning in their varied and colorful styles of uniforms. Just sitting in the lobby and watching them is a treat.

I stayed there on both the first and last nights of my visit to Italy, taking advantage of some special on-line offers of extra miles on my frequent flyer account with an airline.

Having said that, I must add that the rooms were not cheap. My first night cost more than $300, which I learned did not include (""at that price point"") the breakfast buffet. Nor was the WiFi free. I could sign up for a one-day access to the Internet if I wanted to pay for it.

There was another surprise. Planning to check out at 11:30 the next morning, I found someone ringing at my room door at 10:30. Being a woman alone, and not yet dressed, I did not answer and then heard someone use a key card to try to open the door, which I had locked from the inside. I could not see anyone through the peephole, so I asked who was there. A man answered, ""Housekeeping."" I told him I did not need housekeeping, and that I was checking out in an hour. He did not reply, but went away. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN TO A WOMAN TRAVELING ALONE. I later alerted the front desk that this incident had occurred.

On my second visit a week later, the breakfast buffet was included in a $250 room. This buffet was massive and varied and featured everything from the usual fruits, meats, cereals and cheeses, to eggs, sausage, breads, salads, rice, noodles, and Asian food, a true brunch.

This time my room had a desk lamp that did not work and sound effects from the room above, as if guests were continuously rearranging the furniture, sliding heavy luggage over the uncarpeted floor, or perhaps opening and closing drawers or the closet's sliding door. This noise went on until midnight.

Airport noise did not penetrate the windows, however. The rooms were clean and the hot water adequate. Ironing board, iron, hot pot, and a well-stocked mini fridge were present, and my twin bed was deliciously comfortable, with heavenly plump pillows.

Overall, this is a fine hotel in a perfect location. Avoiding the hassle of a shuttle bus more than makes up for other imperfections and helps to justify the higher price. I'm glad I splurged.",May 2018,Hilton Rome Airport Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g656615-d228406-Reviews-Hilton_Rome_Airport_Hotel-Fiumicino_Province_of_Rome_Lazio.html,"Fiumicino, Italy",hotels,4.0,3.5

Surrounded by tropical warmth, she soaks it up and warms herself thoroughly. Butterflies of every color flutter about. (My personal favorites are the large, iridescent blue ones.)

The Finest Wool Yarns!,"It was an early spring afternoon, and suffering from a sudden urge to knit a particular pattern, I knew that I could find the highest quality wool yarns at this place. I hadn't visited in years. Yes, it was tiny, and friendly, and displayed only a few dozen colors, which weren't cheap, but those yarns were exquisite heathers in enough shades that I could easily find the perfect one for the project that I had in mind. They also offered a fine selection of wooden knitting needles and crochet hooks. I find their yarns to be spun quite tight, so I usually need to ""unspin"" them a bit so I can knit a softer garment. That's an easy process, and worth the effort. Most yarn stores and craft shops these days stock acrylics. Good wool worsted is hard to find, but it's what Green Mountain Spinnery is all about.

Great for Gluten-Free Sunday Brunch!,"Finding nice places to enjoy a meal after church has been a challenge, so when a church friend cited Burtons as her all-time favorite, we decided to try it. We were delighted! Burtons is tucked into a modern mall-type retail cluster with good parking in back. When we entered, the greeter asked us right away if we wanted the regular menu or their ""gluten-sensitive"" one. Then at our table the server asked if gluten-free meals were a strict necessity or merely a preference. Now THAT is sensitivity at a level I have never encountered before, ever. Hats off to Burtons! My friend ordered a Reuben with sweet potato fries and I chose tacos with beef tenderloin and an arugula salad. Our meals arrived beautifully presented and colorful. And the flavor...oh my! Both the tacos and the salad were prepared with a perfect balance of flavors and textures, a real treat. My friend's Reuben was so generous that she ended up taking half of it home.

We ordered the trout with vegetables and corn muffins, at a very good price. Our main dish arrived, but without any utensils or napkins. We had to ask for them and at first received plastic, then finally metal. The corn muffins (and biscuits) came later as well. Our fish was tasty and cooked to perfection, and the broccoli superb. The muffins and biscuits were fresh from the oven. The green beans, though flavorful, appeared to have come out of a can. If desserts were available, we were never offered any.

Service was friendly, albeit slow, and our server absentmindedly left our gift card (which carried a leftover balance) on someone else's table, discovering it only after we went looking for her because we had waited far too long for her to return with it.

On balance, however, this informal eatery is a good place to find good local food. Overlook the litter that you may find under your table in the form of empty jelly or coffee creamer containers--they never swept the floor between parties, and children must have been seated there earlier!

Access from the highway is effortless. From I-91, take the exit for Route 2 East, then immediately exit on Routes 5 & 10 South. Denny's will be on your left, on the east side of Routes 5 & 10. Afterward you will be only a stone's throw from Route 2 to get back on I-91 and resume your journey.

Unless, of course, you prefer to stay on Routes 5 & 10 south just a few miles to Main Street in Greenfield, then turn right on Route 2A west and rejoin I-91 at the rotary, where the Mohawk Trail also begins and will take you through the Berkshires to Albany via some of the most beautiful countryside in New England.

"Sunday Brunch is Superb, but Please Add Some Gluten-Free Baked Goods!","This was our first visit to Mill on the River, and we enjoyed Sunday brunch at an outdoor table overlooking the river. Flowers outside on the covered footbridge were stunning.

For brunch, the $19.95 price is a deal. It includes two drinks--for anyone who can handle alcohol that early in the day! I stuck to a virgin Bloody Mary.

The menu offers an excellent and varied brunch fare, from eggs with breakfast meats to fish, chicken, or beef. One orders the entree, then visits the buffet for juices, fruits, and baked desserts.

Fresh melon chunks are abundant, as are smoked salmon with sour cream, small bagel halves, and cream cheese and/or jelly. Then there are the desserts, wonderful-looking baked confections from cakes to cookies.

Our entrees were excellent, filet of sole with rice pilaf and a tiny piece of broccoli for me, ham and fried eggs for my guest.

Since both of us avoid gluten, and no gluten-free notations were made on the menu, we had to use our judgment in ordering. Also, the mouth-watering baked desserts on display included nothing marked gluten-free. We were surprised that a restaurant of this caliber does not provide gluten-free options for its guests.

Mill on the River is such a lovely establishment, and such a wonderful place to enjoy brunch after church, that I strongly urge them to add some gluten-free choices, maybe a carrot cake or some brownies--I would be happy to send them the recipes!",September 2017,Mill on the River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33928-d385737-Reviews-Mill_on_the_River-South_Windsor_Connecticut.html,"South Windsor, Connecticut",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Wonderful for walking,"I come here as often as I can, at least once or twice a week, not to visit the pond itself but to walk the wide and unpaved Bear's Den Road that curves around to the south of it, through Temple Woods. Couples and families stroll through here, many walk their dogs, and some jog. I have always found this area (away from the pond itself) to be peaceful and I have felt safe. I have never encountered a coyote or bear or homeless person away from the pond. Smaller trails branch off the dirt road and go up and down hills, but much of the road itself is level.

Perfect for an Intimate Dining Experience,"Gypsy Apple is so tiny that it would be easy to miss amid the other modest storefront spaces on Bridge Street. But try not to miss it, especially if you want a superb dining experience and a long, intimate conversation with a special friend. You won't be disappointed. Reservations are a must. This is a small place with only about seven tables, white linen tablecloths, and a whirring fan on a hot summer evening. Be seated. You're in for a treat. Our appetizers of salad and grilled sweetbreads with asparagus were served with both originality and elegance. Then came the lamb chops with herbed mashed potatoes and asparagus, everything done to perfection. We shared a dessert of cheesecake. A certain brilliance goes into every dish served at Gypsy Apple. Expect to pay well for this brilliance. It will be worth it. Best of all, Gypsy Apple is the perfect place for a long, intimate conversation, followed by a stroll through the village.

Take a stroll across the bridge in any season, at any time of day, and you will continually be surprised and delighted. Entrance to the bridge is always free, but donations are gratefully received.

Elegant,"The Farm Table is one of those elegant restaurants to visit for a special occasion. If you go all out for soup, appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert, plan on spending generously. In return you will be treated to elegant surroundings, unique flavor combinations, and professional service. We shared appetizers of mussels and bisque, plus I enjoyed fried oysters on a mound of baby greens. We both ordered cod, then shared some beautifully prepared cheesecake. The seafood was cooked to perfection, and we were happy to find nothing smothered in greasy or starchy sauces. My guest also found an ample selection of gluten-free options throughout the menu. The restaurant was built into a historic home that I had visited often years ago, enjoying many Sunday afternoons over tea and cookies in the front room with the previous owners. Its conversion to a restaurant is a delight to behold. One issue I must note, however, is that the on-line menu did not match the menu we received when we were seated. For such upscale and expensive dining, I would expect the on-line menu to be kept current. Aside from that, it was an enjoyable evening and I was happy to leave there feeling nourished and satisfied, but not stuffed.",April 2017,The Farm Table,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41462-d2423548-Reviews-The_Farm_Table-Bernardston_Massachusetts.html,"Bernardston, Massachusetts",restaurants,4.0,4.5

"Nutritious Food, Lots of Noise","Paul & Elizabeth's has for years been the Northampton go-to place for friends who seek a nutritious meal, tastefully served. Individual salads are prepared with fine baby greens, and salad dressings are uniquely flavorful. Our fish was fresh and delicious, and the vegetables still crunchy and not overlooked. Quantities were just right for anyone not wanting to overeat. Wines are available. The dining room, on the second floor of Thorne's Marketplace, is bright and airy and overlooks a busy downtown. At lunchtime on a Monday the place was full, with a ten-minute wait. Noise abounds here, magnified by the decorative metal ceiling. It was difficult to carry on a conversation, but this noise was of cheerful people who were happy to be together. Parking in the adjacent downtown garage is inexpensive and very convenient--use the pedestrian bridge from Level 2-3.

Browse through a two-level bookstore, pick out some fine chocolates, try on lovely blouses, finger some colorful scarves, find that special wedding gift, shop for a fine necklace, and pick up fresh crayons for the kids. And yes, make time for a glass of wine with a lovely meal at Paul & Elizabeth's. You've spent two hours shopping?

Great View of a Magical Town,"When people are new to the Greenfield area, one of the first places I take them is Poet's Seat Tower. Stroll or drive to the tower's base and climb to the second or third level and feast your eyes on the panorama that unfolds below. Greenfield sits in a protected bowl. The Berkshires rise on the west edge of town; the agriculturally rich Pioneer Valley extends to the south; the Connecticut River runs along the east edge of town; and the hills of Vermont begin to the north. Poet's Seat Tower sits atop a ridge that separates Greenfield from the river. Look below on both sides and you can see church spires, tennis courts, hospital, Victorian homes, and the treetops that grace every street. Half an hour up there, enjoying the fresh breeze, will bring you a peaceful sense of why people treasure this town. A visit to the tower is free, though the park closes at dusk each day.

An Elegant Treat,"Having driven past the Deerfield Inn almost daily for thirty years, I seldom considered dining there. This place was for wealthy tourists, no? Then came a special birthday, and a desire to splurge on an elegant lunch for a friend. We were not disappointed! This November day was drizzly and raw. How wonderful to come inside and find cheerful fires blazing in multiple fireplaces. We worked on a large jigsaw puzzle by the warm fire as we waited the few minutes for Champney's to open. Then we were ushered into a bright dining room with another warm fire. Our surroundings were quiet and restful, as most people had gathered near the bar in the next room. Our meal proved to be exquisite, from warm herbed bread and wonderful clam chowder to beautiful salads of baby greens, dressed flavorfully. The fried cod was fresh and prepared with expertise, the slaw sweet and colorful. Desserts were offered by showing us a tray of them rather than a menu. The chocolate layer confection was to die for, rich and heavy and deeply satisfying. This birthday celebration proved to be an elegant treat on a foggy November afternoon.

Our tour guide was filled with knowledge about the castle, its history, how the rooms were once used, why and when it was built, destroyed, rebuilt, and destroyed over the centuries. One can climb the steep circular staircase and spend time on several floors, taking in how it must have felt to sleep on moldy straw and deal with dampness that rotted whatever tapestries might once have hung on the walls.

Great Place for a Fine Lunch,"Meeting a friend of a friend for lunch while in Ireland, on her recommendation I connected with her at Bailey's Hotel. I arrived quite early and took advantage of the extra time by waiting in a comfortable and cozy sitting room across from the hotel's front desk. It was the perfect place to use the hotel's WiFi signal to check e-mail. A fine restroom was also available on a lower level, near the restaurant. The restaurant itself, near the bar downstairs, was dark and comfortable and just right for a long conversation. It did fill rapidly with small groups of people who made plenty of cheerful noise.

Modest but Convenient,"Park Inn by Radisson at Shannon Airport could not be in a more convenient location, just a short walk across the parking lot from the terminal building. The place was modest. My room was clean, the carpet in excellent condition, the closet enormous, the bed supremely comfortable. However, the sink was cracked badly in three directions and lacked any kind of screening mechanism to prevent items from falling down the drain. I would caution anyone to be careful not to drop tweezers, earrings, or toothbrush into the sink--you might never see them again! The flat screen TV was fine, but the hot pot area had seen better days, the tiny and somewhat shabby counter having been repainted with black high gloss paint. There was a cabinet designed to hold a small refrigerator, but the cabinet was empty. The room also lacked a clock. When I pulled the drapes to shut them, they began to come right off their hooks. The view out my window was of windows to other rooms, so I really needed to shut those drapes. When a door slammed anywhere on the corridor, the entire building seemed to tremble. Aircraft noise was minimal, though. The heavenly comfortable bed, and the outstanding location, made up for this hotel's other shortcomings. Staff were friendly and helpful. If you don't expect luxury and you need to catch an early flight, this place will provide you with a good night's sleep within walking distance.",September 2016,Park Inn by Radisson Shannon Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g211884-d652558-Reviews-Park_Inn_by_Radisson_Shannon_Airport-Shannon_County_Clare.html,"Shannon, Ireland",hotels,3.0,4.0
Outstanding,"I booked a room at Corcoran's Lodge for seven nights, and this was the perfect place to stay! It is impeccably maintained, run by a delightful couple who clearly love what they do. Breakfast, served at times that best suited guests rather than the cook, included an artistically arranged fresh fruit plate, yogurt, homemade brown bread, OJ, and a piping hot plate of fried egg, sausage, meaty bacon, warm tomato, and fresh mushrooms! As I set off each morning on my day's adventures, Cathy would stand in the doorway and wave goodbye. Likewise, my hosts appreciated a tap on their kitchen door when I returned each evening. They were always anxious to hear how my day had gone. One evening when I arrived with groceries for a simple supper in my room, Cathy insisted on arranging my salad, cold chicken slices, and avocado on a proper plate and tray, with silverware and a fresh linen napkin! I felt cared for and loved. The household also included a polite and friendly shepherd mix dog named Lottie, who was a joy to know. The location of Corcoran's Lodge can be tricky to find--I drove into Ferns, parked near the church, phoned, and asked plaintively, ""How do I FIND you?"" In no time Zdenek arrived with a warm smile to lead the way! Signage for the Lodge is subtle--a handsome black sign with small gold letters, hanging under deep shade and backlit by afternoon sunlight. After turning left into the shared driveway, one steers to the right (where there's another subtle sign that I never noticed the first six times I drove past it). To find Corcoran's Lodge, my suggestion would be to follow signs for Clone House and then continue to the top of the hill and look carefully on the left. It will be well worth it. Finally I must mention that the bedrooms are upstairs, up the carpeted front staircase. Guests must be physically able to climb stairs. If that is no problem, all is truly outstanding. Corcoran's Lodge is everything that a B&B should be, safe, warm, loving, and filled with genuine Irish hospitality.

Very Nice,"The Courtyard in Ferns might be referred to as the only game in town, the only local restaurant where one can sit down to a very nice meal, either in the pub or up a few steps in the carpeted library. Families gather there, and local clergy stop in for coffee. I ate there three times during my week in Ferns. Abundant parking is available in the church lot across the street. On the menu, I was happy with the warm chicken salad, which featured an abundance of flavorful meat. I also enjoyed the lasagna, which was rich with meat. Staff were friendly and kind. I did find it odd and puzzling, however, to see dirty dishes accumulate outside the kitchen doors rather than beyond them, as if the kitchen truly had no room for them yet and they had to remain visible to arriving patrons who hadn't yet ordered their meals. Looking at dirty dishes of strangers can be unappetizing.

Roland and Steve are committed hosts. Roland graciously accommodated my dietary needs, and one evening when I returned carrying a hot Utica fish fry he offered me a proper dinner plate, cloth napkin, and utensils so I could enjoy it in style. The Inn is located on a state highway near a very active railroad, but modern windows and a white noise machine muffle any intrusive noise. The water supply, designed to function adequately with a full house of guests, was automatically interrupted once in the middle of the night because of how the Inn's private well system functions in a drought. Bottled water is always available, and Roland was most careful about making sure to reset the system in time for morning showers. The food?

It is a very good accommodation to get a solid night's sleep, and breakfast was abundant. I was able to grab coffee, a few hard boiled eggs and some bananas, drink a quick cup of juice, and get right on the road. If I had lingered I could have enjoyed everything from eggs and breakfast meats to fresh waffles, yogurt, pastry, bagels, and cereals. I did find that the check-in clerk did not at first believe that my stay could earn American Airlines AAdvantage miles, though I gave him my frequent flyer number to be sure that it went on record for this visit. Also, parking anywhere near the front and back doors was full. I had to park on the north side and walk all the way around the front of the building, because my room key did not work in the nearest door (near the pool), though I could exit through that door.

"Some Great Things, Some Not so Great","Using their park-sleep-fly option I stayed one night, left my car there for several days and used their free shuttle bus to get to Logan Airport for an 8:30 a.m. flight. Staff could not have been nicer. They were friendly and helpful to the max, and my car was safe. The room was clean and well appointed, with microwave and refrigerator, and the windows muffled any outdoor noise. Tap water in the sink was not very hot, lukewarm at best. Maybe I should have let it run longer? The commode became noisy, loudly taking in water for two or three seconds every minute or so. Finally I shut off the valve to it so I could get some sleep! Still, I could hear the same sound of water in nearby rooms. This hotel offers free breakfast and the aromas waft upstairs, but breakfast does not begin until six, too late for anyone taking an early flight and needing to reach Logan two hours prior to departure. The shuttle bus ran regularly, and pick-up upon return was a breeze. Then I just unlocked my car and drove away, the only problem being salt spray on the windshield, one of the headaches of parking on the coast. Oh, one last point. The WiFi could not be accessed, either from my room or from the lobby, even with help from staff. If there was a view I never saw it, as I arrived after dark and left after dark.

It felt safe to be out walking at night. Staff was most accommodating, though it took a while to find the office! The room was lovely and the bed comfortable, but clearly it had been a while since someone had swept or dusted the floor under the bed. In that way it felt just like home! The room had a thermostat for baseboard forced hot water heat, but turning up the heat did not seem to have any effect at night. I was cold! The room had no extra blanket, and getting to the office to request one would have meant donning a coat and crossing the driveway in the rain. (It never occurred to me to pick up the phone!)

Don't expect to find a TV set or supplies of free shampoo and conditioner. Instead you will find a comfortable high bed that might even come with a canopy and bed curtains. I could spread maps out on a round table in the corner, or meditate in a chair by the window. Outside were a lawn, abundant trees, and the Esopus Creek barely visible far below the back yard. I slept in peaceful stillness, woke with the birds, made a cup of Keurig coffee in the front hall, and sipped it by the open bedroom window. This historic house, exquisitely maintained, comes with wide (creaking) floorboards but modern plumbing and free WiFi. Breakfast, with four or five other sets of guests, was abundant, flavorful, and varied (yeast-raised waffles, fresh cherries, melon and kiwi, homemade granola, and savory seeded bread). By the way, my room also had a whirlpool bath! I could see spending a week here, to unwind from life's stresses and to reconnect with Spirit. Even one night brought me deep peacefulness. No wonder people love this place.",July 2015,The Stone House Bed and Breakfast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g47942-d1466964-Reviews-The_Stone_House_Bed_and_Breakfast-Hurley_Catskill_Region_New_York.html,"Hurley, New York",hotels,5.0,4.5
Wonderful Deep Quiet,"I stayed here on a solo trip to research local family history. A woman alone needs to feel comfortable and safe, and this B&B fit the bill perfectly. Melissa was warm, welcoming and cheerful. I took a long sunset walk down into the village and back, lingering by the fountain and gardens in the center of Ft. Plain. Overnight I knew a deep stillness that I had forgotten existed. Such quiet! In the morning I heard the clip clop of a local horse pulling an Amish buggy. Melissa's breakfast was perfect, with berries, melon, yogurt, and a wonderful western egg medley, all served with care. She stored my food and ice pack overnight, and she accommodated my wish to take early-morning coffee to my room. I will definitely consider returning in the future. This visit was an absolute pleasure.",July 2015,A White Rose Bed and Breakfast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g47743-d6731039-Reviews-A_White_Rose_Bed_and_Breakfast-Fort_Plain_New_York.html,"Fort Plain, New York",hotels,5.0,5.0
"Comfortable, clean, convenient.","I walked in very tired after a long day and was met with cheerfulness and warmth. The room came with free WiFi, refrigerator, microwave, ironing board and iron, more amenities than I expected. Across the street is a large mall with a Whole Foods Market. Breakfast was most adequate and varied, though crowded and with lots of spillage from families and elders alike. This is a very nice place to stay. I was in town to do research at the NY State Library.",July 2015,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Albany Airport - Wolf Road,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29786-d93040-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Suites_Albany_Airport_Wolf_Road-Albany_New_York.html,"Albany, New York",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Modern, clean, and convenient.","After ten days in the Irish countryside, I stayed here the night before my flight home. Parked in the parking garage behind the hotel and had a difficult time figuring out how to reach the lobby without circling all around the building. Turns out that the lobby has a back door, but it is not obvious. Staff at the front desk were most helpful in answering questions and free WiFi was available in the lobby, with private areas to sit comfortably. The room was quiet and so modern that it took some experimenting to figure out how the lights worked! The shower was wonderfully massive. No toiletries, shower cap, or facecloth were provided, but the gel soap from wall dispensers proved quite adequate. Tremendous scooped sink! A large heated towel rack was most welcome. Bed was comfortable but made up with a single covering that appeared to be a warm blanket inside a white sheet duvet. This covering proved way too warm on a night when just a sheet would have been fine. I got very little sleep because of this. Hint: If you are returning a rental car at the airport, ask the front desk in advance for detailed directions to the airport car return area--you are going to need them, as airport signage is abysmal and you will likely be driving in fog during the morning rush hour. You will, however, be able to fill the car's gas tank at a station very close to the hotel, but do it the night before so that you don't have to weave your way back and forth to reverse direction just to reach it when you're hurried in the morning.",September 2014,Premier Inn Dublin Airport hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315871-d575837-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Dublin_Airport_hotel-Swords_County_Dublin.html,"Swords, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.5
