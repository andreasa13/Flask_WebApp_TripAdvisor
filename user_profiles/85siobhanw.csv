Yummmmmmmm,"Beautiful evening at lukers... The zesty taste of salad garnish with the fish cakes is lingering and followed that with the best steak I've had for a while,not every chef can cook a steak with such perfection added to the quality of the food is worth every penny spent.... Beautiful view added to the whole experience... The young staff although very busy did a great job looking after everyone.... Thanks to Sean and his team for looking after us... Highly recommended for a relaxing evening out...",July 2019,Lukers bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1391357-d7004045-Reviews-Lukers_bar-Shannonbridge_County_Offaly.html,"Shannonbridge, Ireland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Love it...,Stayed in this area and can't wait to return here some other time.... Peaceful place with friendly people.... Lot's of cat's loved and looked after by the local people.... Just a beautiful area of Athens.... Only thing I didn't like was the few Roma women begging with their children but then again we see this in many places around Europe.... Plaka is in all a beautiful part of Athens worth the visit and stay....,April 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fabulous....,"From the minute I opened the door to this hotel I was more then happy... Receptionist is always the 1st person you meet,she was super nice... This hotel is beautiful and a hive of activity during the day with meetings and conferences,a superb place to host such an event... The bar area was amazing and the bar man who served us 'Alan' was most professional and friendly....As was 'Dean' the young DM,he is definitely on the way up... I enjoyed the enjoyed the bubbly drink gifted to me for my birthday... I love the coffee dock area tended by 'Anna' she was really sweet and made a very good cappuccino.. I love the fact that the coffee dock is on the 1st level on entrance to the bar and serves all the scones, pastries, with its own seating area,very well thought out... We didn't eat in the bar but the food looked great instead we opted on both nights to eat in their adjoining restaurant Kelly's Steakhouse,one of the nicest places I've eaten in for an age... The food on both nights was fantastic and the desserts still lingering on the hips... Again the staff here are a credit to the place, polite, professional and immaculate to the eye(some been students just finished exam's and working their way through college)... Both the hotel and the restaurant are one of the nicest I've been in for a long time 5* ... Sadly this time did not get to use the spa but will be watching out for offers coming up as I'm definitely returning here for a pampering session... I would highly recommend this hotel for all sorts of things.... Must also mention the house keeping staff who were also freindly and very helpful... We had a triple room and could not fault it one bit... Well done to the team all around for welcoming us and the 5* quality service.. I really can't wait to return... Very much recommended to stay here... Thank you again",January 2019,Midlands Park Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g551563-d289687-Reviews-Midlands_Park_Hotel-Portlaoise_County_Laois.html,"Portlaoise, Ireland",hotels,5.0,4.0
Perfecto...,"Having stayed here over the weekend I could not fault it from start to finish. From Tracy at reception, Angel at the bar and Anna and Iwona in the restaurant, indeed all the staff very polite and friendly but not invasive...The bed was really comfy... Breakfast was fresh with a nice Verity,loved the special brown bread ... Over the weekend I also had food in the evening,the prawn cocktail with freshly cooked prawns was delicious, I also had the lentils which was devine as a vegetarian dish, also had the red curry, very tasty... The overall hotel was super clean... Very central.... Looking forward to returning again next month....",January 2019,The Ellison,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186626-d629319-Reviews-The_Ellison-Castlebar_County_Mayo_Western_Ireland.html,"Castlebar, Ireland",hotels,5.0,4.0
Day time....,"Lots going on here in the day so I can only imagine it at night time.... No hazzle what so ever... A polite no thank you is enough... Beautiful shop's, juice stalls, cafe's and much more... Being on my own was no bother at all and will be going back in the night with a local to get the experience of the lively night.... My only sad side was the poor monkeys, horrible and even worse to see tourists getting photos taken with them it just didn't seam right to me and the poor snakes with their mouths sewn up, unbelievably sad and I'm sure it's destressing for many to tourists to see this... You know what they say 'you can see into the soul of a man on how he treats animals' and these men seamed down right nasty..... Outside of that a place full of life and beautiful people.... And like anywhere in the world just mind your bag and keep it shut tight",September 2018,Medina of Marrakesh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d324126-Reviews-Medina_of_Marrakesh-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.0
Lovely!*,"Visited here on my own and just had a starter ""Tri coloured salad,it was simple yet a vision to the eye when it was presented to me.... As they say we eat first with the eye.... Tasted just as good as it looks.... Also had half bottle of really nice red wine recommend by young man serving 'assi"" not sure if that's how it's spelt he was from Casablanca... May I add that he was so professional in his manner and not at all invasive... I hope all staff are like him... Lovely restaurant and very reasonable priced... Just wish I was hungrier.... Beautiful presentation in a starter is a great sign of more to follow .....",September 2018,Mani A Mano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d12400713-Reviews-Mani_A_Mano-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great craic....,We stopped by here for a bite to eat and drink.... We were not disappointed... We all are something different and no one was disappointed.... Had the Dirty burger was so messy and yummy and the burger itself was Juicy like it should be not some kind of flat patty.... We even stayed longer opting to take a later train... Meet lot's of nice different interesting fun people... The pub itself is awesome....

Wow...,"On a rainy damp December morning I decided to take the chance and hop on this.... To me what I saw took home to me what traveling and the beautiful mother earth is all about... What I saw was eeire mystical fairy tale place... Advice is not to spend to much time on the phone/camera..... If I was here another day I would go again.... Seeing this in the winter is totally magical... The boat was fab, staff very friendly... And they serve coffee ect so that you can warm up... Dress up in layers so that you can spend the time on deck....",December 2017,Rodne Fjord Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190511-d2056172-Reviews-Rodne_Fjord_Cruise-Stavanger_Stavanger_Municipality_Rogaland_Western_Norway.html,"Stavanger, Norway",attractions,5.0,4.5
A pity!!,"Popped in here for a bite to eat on my own and ya what to say.... Waiter was not rude but not freindly either.... I had panner which I must say was really nice in itself but let down by the atmosphere.... Not a note of music in the background,just a still tence cold vib... I ate the delicious food and quickly left... Such a shame really....",December 2017,Maharaja,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190502-d1139411-Reviews-Maharaja-Bergen_Hordaland_Western_Norway.html,"Bergen, Norway",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Nice atmosphere....,"Hmmm this place is very nice and the staff are friendly and all smiling.... I had a supposedly speciality peppered tenderloin steak and it's not that it was awful but for the price it was somewhat of a let down, the sauce was nothing like pepper sauce and was swimming in it... But don't understand why previous review said they were unaware of the corn ect as clearly states on the menu what it is served with... I did enjoy it,the beef was perhaps to fresh for my liking... When I asked the server (very pleasant girl)was the beef local Norwegian she said all beef was... I had the small steak, two glasses of wine and a dessert(which was chocolious) served with a rum over Ice,was just under €90...for me alone...was nice definitely not worth that much... Overall nice place, nice staff and good atmosphere....",December 2017,Big Horn Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190502-d775168-Reviews-Big_Horn_Steakhouse-Bergen_Hordaland_Western_Norway.html,"Bergen, Norway",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Loved it...,"Although the weather wasn't great up I went... The views were awesome and I imagine that at other times of the year even better.... I decided to walk back down and so glad I did...was no bother at all.... Lovely lovely trek back down so much so going again tomorrow for Christmas day, what better way to spend it... I imagine that at different times of year it's more alive in itself, beautiful woodland and more, kid's running free in nature's garden... Might even trek up tomorrow but did enjoy the tram up....",December 2017,Mount Floyen and the Funicular,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190502-d246101-Reviews-Mount_Floyen_and_the_Funicular-Bergen_Hordaland_Western_Norway.html,"Bergen, Norway",attractions,5.0,4.5
Sunset at lukers :-),"Had dinner here yesterday evening and watched the sun go down... I am a very fussy eater and I must say that the food was just fab.... I had the sirloin steak and sweet potato wedges ""sweetalious"" the presentation and the quality is right up my street and well worth the trip out there....

Wowzer.....,A hidden gem in Prague.... We were fascinated with the guy's and their amazing art of cocktail making.... We went in for one and left after five.... Never in all my travels have I had anything like it.... Beautiful atmosphere and the two guy's serving were ace... Friendly and awesome place.....
