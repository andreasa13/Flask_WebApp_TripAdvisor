No Good,"Went there on a recommendation from a friend, who said in the past (eight years ago) was good. It was anything but good! We ordered 1 kg of lamb chops, which were much less than a kilo, closer to 3/4 of a kilo. They were not cooked, so we had to send them back. Second time around they were reasonably cooked. We ordered french fries which were limp and cold. We ordered fried zucchini and eggplant. The zucchini was drenched in oil and tasted horrible. The egg plant was decent but also drenched in oil. The famous “tzatziki” did not have any cucumber and was loaded with garlic and plain yogurt!
We paid €75 for all of the above including a kilo of wine!

Don't do it! Unreliable!,"Booked a whale watching tour for 29 August 2019, during supposedly the peak of whale watching season. Even though it was raining, with high-winds, the boat took off and was forced to come back because of the gale force winds and rough seas. Of course, we were not able to see any whales and the trip was very rough.
While we were at sea all subsequent tours for this company and other companies (for all types of cruises) were canceled for the day. We were told we had a voucher to come back and board free of charge. Unfortunately, because I was leaving the following day to go back to Europe, I spoke both to the staff on board and on the pier regarding my situation. They advised that I write to the company and explain my case. I was assured, that due to the extenuating circumstances about the weather and the fact that I was leaving permanently the following day, I would be issued a refund. I wrote to the company, enclosing copies of my airline tickets, for the following day, and the first response after 18 days was ... to close my ticket without even replying to me!

I sent another email, again with copies of my tickets to show them that I would not be coming back to Australia and that I was a permanent resident in a foreign country and this time, after 14 days, I received a response that they were forwarding my ticket to corporate.

Finally, after 25 days, I get the following response: “Unfortunately your request has been rejected, as per booking condition, we are unable to refund for any return voucher. You can keep your return voucher for the next season.”

So basically, the bottom line is, even though the company canceled all the trips for that day because of the weather conditions ( which were bad to begin with) and we were forced to come back because of those same weather conditions, there is no refund!

Buyer beware! Be very careful! I would not use them again! This was not an issue of not seeing any whales… it was an issue that there was a warning for all boats to remain tied down. A full refund should have been issued!",August 2019,Sydney Whale Watching,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d8540208-Reviews-Sydney_Whale_Watching-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,1.0,4.0
