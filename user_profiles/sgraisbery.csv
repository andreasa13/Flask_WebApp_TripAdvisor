The best of Glassboro,There are not a lot of places I can say I never had a bad meal if I went there many times but I can say that about the Monarch Diner. The owners and managers are very alert to what is going on at the busy times in the diner. The service is top shelve and the food is fresh. If there is one complaint it would be the parking. There are times there is such a rush and I may need to park across the street. Nice problem to have if you are a restaurant.,December 2019,Monarch Diner and Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46462-d16721966-Reviews-Monarch_Diner_and_Restaurant-Glassboro_New_Jersey.html,"Glassboro, New Jersey",restaurants,5.0,4.5
EXPERIENCE MODERN JAPANESE,We had a group of 8 and it was a wonderful time for everyone. Our waiter explained the menu and the choices. He was excellent. We all got the $75.00 per person and ate just about everything the restaurant had to offer. The steak was perfect and I had this drink called Widow of The East and was really good. The atmosphere was good but a little too dark so bring your flashlight.
