Not impressed. Expected more.,Given all the glowing reviews I expected much more. As another reviewer recently mentioned the bathroom was a huge letdown. Looked like whoever cleaned it is just looking to get in and out. As you can see in the picture there is no way this drain should have been installed. It looks horrible and not at all what I would expect to see. There were some spots of the wallpaper coming up in the bathroom as well. The towels were like 80 grit sandpaper. They were well beyond their useful life. They should be used to clean the bathroom shower. A minor nuisance but one side of the bed had zero electrical outlets. None. There was a small clock radio but I couldn’t even unplug it as it went somewhere behind the headboard. I had to plug in my phone and leave it across the room at night. Rest of the place was very clean. Bed was comfy and sheets were clean.,February 2021,SpringHill Suites San Antonio Northwest at The RIM,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60956-d10006331-Reviews-SpringHill_Suites_San_Antonio_Northwest_at_The_RIM-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",hotels,3.0,4.5
Great place. Actually interactive,Took my granddaughter here. Little pricey but the animals are very well cared for. Got to pet and feed all kinds of animals and fish.

Another must see,"Obviously if you are going to Athens you will be coming here.

Get the €30 pass so you can visit multiple places. Go early in the morning just at opening. Go straight to the top as soon as you enter to avoid the crowds and tours.

Hotel has a very small 2-3 people elevators but they need to be that small. So if you travel with 4 people you’ll need both lifts.

9/11/19 Bad bad experience,"Having been here several times, I was looking forward to going back. Food and bartenders were always great.

Arrived there tonight and the bartender was great. We ordered Buffalo chicken dip and what came out was more like a chicken spread. There was no dip to be found. It was like spreadable chicken with a hint of orange. You could not dunk or or even find any liquid.

We asked the bartender if it is normally this dry or did something happen. She went and asked in the kitchen about it as it looked dry to her too. Chef said that’s how it comes out after being put in the oven. Ok fine. It is what it is.

We then ordered a steak medium which came out looking like it was a piece of charcoal from the grille. It was blacker than my lungs. I can only guess to cover up the fact that it was beyond well done he decided to over season it? Not sure. While we were eating our baked potato (which was the only thing not over cooked) the woman seated next to us got a steak tip meal.

I don’t know how she ordered her steak tips but they were also cooked to Hell and back. She cut into a few of them and didn’t eat anymore.

Again we have come here several times and always loved it. The prime rib is fantastic. Will only go back for that. Whoever was cooking tonight needs to be removed forcibly from the kitchen and never allowed to cook again.

Our bartender was excellent and I didn’t want her tips to suffer because of the bad cook. After paying for our meal I went over to her and explained how awful the food was. She offered to make it right but I told her it was not her fault and wanted to tell her to have a talk with the chef before more people got their nights ruined.

All told I spent $60 for a baked potato and some Pepsi. My wife had some Knob Creek and the other half of the worlds most expensive baked potato.

The trip itself was phenomenal. We saw so many things. Everything we asked for and so much more. We’ve been telling everyone we can to go to Alexonthebeach.

Beautiful resort,"Stayed here for a week.

The grounds are amazing. Extremely well cared for. Maybe too well cared for. They usually start cutting grass at around 7am. You will hear it on first or second floor.

The rooms are well appointed, and plenty large enough. The shower is awesome. Everything about the layout and quality is great. My only issue with the buildings is that you can hear anyone outside the door, or in the other room. We had to move rooms at 3am due to a screaming baby in the next room. Apparently the parents just wanted to let the baby cry itself to sleep. We called the office and they were fantastic. Within 15min we were in a new room in another building. They handled it perfectly.

The food is hit or miss. 90% of the items in the World Cafe are good. The pizza was great. The best steak there is at El Patio. It was great. The others are just ok. We found ourselves going back to the two listed above.

The servers in the restaurants are also hit or miss. They are mostly very very friendly. It appears as if they each have a specific function but a lot of time they seem to be disorganized. They forget drinks frequently or don’t even come to the table. I think a manager is needed to provide organization and better service.

The pools are first class. There are so many pools you never feel crowded. It is very well run and taken care of. The water and pool areas are clean. Every pool was sparkling clean at all times.

This next mention is well deserved. We have been to many many places and have NEVER had service like we got from Suzeth in the pool area. She is without a doubt the best waitress/server we have ever had the pleasure of having. She went out of her way to help us, talk to us, and make us feel welcome. We couldn’t wait to see her every day down by the pool and would only sit in her area. Everyone was commenting on how good of a job she did. Suzeth should be commended as she is an excellent ambassador for the resort. She should be one of the faces of Dreams Las Mareas as she is that good. We hope to return in part due to Suzeth.

There are so many aspects of this resort it is hard to review them all. Overall we have had a great time and wouldn’t hesitate to come back.

Will definitely go back if in the area. Had a great time.",March 2017,Seneca Niagara Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g48261-d282631-Reviews-Seneca_Niagara_Casino-Niagara_Falls_New_York.html,"Niagara Falls, New York",attractions,4.0,3.5
"Not terrible, but needs some work","Check in was smooth, staff friendly. Looks like they have done renovations recently, or at least try to keep up with the place on a regular basis. It was little things, like they must have changed shower hardware, and you could see where the old stuff was. Painting over things that needed to be repaired first. Little things like that all over the place.

The bed. This was the firmest mattress I have ever slept on. The only way to describe it would be to say I have slept on softer floors. We also only had half pillows. They were pretty much useless. Still don't understand that.

Overall, it didn't leave an impression on me. I would go back if necessary, but would seek out someplace different next time.",January 2017,"Country Inn & Suites by Radisson, Bel Air/Aberdeen, MD",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g40997-d254766-Reviews-Country_Inn_Suites_by_Radisson_Bel_Air_Aberdeen_MD-Bel_Air_Maryland.html,"Bel Air, Maryland",hotels,3.0,4.5

"Once again, excellent place to stay","Without a doubt, the only place I will stay in Jacksonville. Rooms are spotless, big and well appointed.

Staff is excellent every single time I have been. Friendly, outgoing, and just the best.

Food during the week is a great way to save money. Great cook. Breakfast was excellent as well with plenty of choices.

Will be back again without a doubt.",January 2017,Staybridge Suites Jacksonville - Camp Lejeune Area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g49242-d6468270-Reviews-Staybridge_Suites_Jacksonville_Camp_Lejeune_Area-Jacksonville_North_Carolina.html,"Jacksonville, North Carolina",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent BBQ,Stopped by here after reading other TripAdvisor reviews and was not disappointed. The food was excellent. My chicken was falling off the bone. Wish they had one closer to me to eat there again. A must stop when you are near one.,January 2017,Mission Bbq,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49242-d7107643-Reviews-Mission_Bbq-Jacksonville_North_Carolina.html,"Jacksonville, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Cheap, fast, and good","Was shocked to get two hot dogs, fries and a cake for $5. Food was excellent, shake was great. Would go hear before any McDonalds or Burger King.",January 2017,Cook-Out Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49242-d4067070-Reviews-Cook_Out_Restaurant-Jacksonville_North_Carolina.html,"Jacksonville, North Carolina",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great night stay,"We had a great night stay here while traveling through. The hotel has many old school charms. Staff was excellent. The pictures on the wall are amazing. Many old photographs of the area and people.

The room has many wood accents and doors. Very clean and well kept. Wooden blinds kept that feeling. The hallways have photos from the period as well.

Downstairs there are slots and other machines. Not too many to distract.

Overall a great, comfortable place to stay. Would come back without hesitation.",August 2016,Bullock Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g54578-d246954-Reviews-Bullock_Hotel-Deadwood_South_Dakota.html,"Deadwood, South Dakota",hotels,5.0,4.0
Good breakfast.,"Visited here on an overnight stay in the Bullock Hotel.

Breakfast was quick. Pancakes were huge. Everything was good including the service.

The decor really makes the place. As you sit there you can imagine all the different people who have been in the room over the years.

Will be back if we stay in deadwood.",August 2016,Bully's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54578-d542161-Reviews-Bully_s-Deadwood_South_Dakota.html,"Deadwood, South Dakota",restaurants,4.0,4.5
A must visit,"If you come to Deadwood you have to visit. It's a must see.

Wild Bill and Calamity Jane are buried side by side here. Beyond that there are many older stones. The grounds are well maintained.

The bus tours are constant here, so timing is key. Just go in between the tours to see the stones. Walking around is easy but there are hills. They have a gift shop near the entrance.",August 2016,Mount Moriah Cemetery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g54578-d145948-Reviews-Mount_Moriah_Cemetery-Deadwood_South_Dakota.html,"Deadwood, South Dakota",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best sliders on Earth!,"Visited here based on Tripadvisor reviews. They were dead on accurate.

Walking in you are greeted and sat. Seems to get pretty busy so get there early.

The sliders were literally the best I've ever eaten. Both meals were phenomenal. Not a single problem or issue. Hopefully will be back soon.",August 2016,Godfather's Burger Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32060-d1976135-Reviews-Godfather_s_Burger_Lounge-Belmont_California.html,"Belmont, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Must visit once.,"Stopped here on a cross country trip. Wasn't disappointed. Easy access. Not sure of the fees since we were allowed in free.

Parking was easy in the garage. Very short walk to the site. As you walk along there are a few exhibits to see. The monument is close and awe inspiring. It is a must see for every American. The level of detail and craftsmanship is amazing.",August 2016,Mount Rushmore National Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60908-d143767-Reviews-Mount_Rushmore_National_Memorial-Keystone_South_Dakota.html,"Keystone, South Dakota",attractions,5.0,4.5
