EXCELLENT .. in every detail,"Incredible, we have owned a home in Mesa for almost 10 years and had given up on PHX as a place to find fine food and wine .. then all of a sudden, thanks to Trip Advisor we find Cafe Monarch ,, INCREDIBLE food, wine, service, timing of plates .. the only comment is that after finally finding ""pluma"" in the USA, the chef overcooked it .. may be due to US health laws but in Spain it is ALWAYS served medium rare .. another plus for them was that they were able to serve me Foie Gras and Banyuls for dessert .. something I have never seen except in France .. ouh la la.. we'll be back!! Plate after plate ... superb!! the timing was perfect .. who wants to be rushed? We spent about 4+ hours dining. that's what I call a dinner ..",February 2020,Cafe Monarch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g31350-d1005734-Reviews-Cafe_Monarch-Scottsdale_Arizona.html,"Scottsdale, Arizona",restaurants,5.0,5.0
