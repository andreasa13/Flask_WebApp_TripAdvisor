Australian-style breakfast place,"Honestly, I'm not quite sure what Australian-style breakfast is, but I can say that the juices, coffees, and especially the yogurt and granola bowl were really good. Friendly service, too.",October 2020,Two Hands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d7060226-Reviews-Two_Hands-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Delicious Mexican food in a relaxing setting,"We went here on a whim – definite home run.

The interior is simple, but very welcoming and very nice.

We got a couple of every kind of taco, and they were all just delicious. The steak tacos were great, but the chorizo ones were even better. One of the things that made all the tacos exceptional is the homemade salsas: a spicy arbol salsa for the steak, and a warm, almost fruity guajillo for the chorizo, for example. So good.

The drink menu is also terrific. La Coloroda (prickly pear) and Grapefuit (w/ mezcal) were excellent; the Flor de Piña was extraordinary.

Friendly service. A bit expensive than your usual taqueria, but so so good.",October 2020,Amaranto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60827-d9562024-Reviews-Amaranto-Brooklyn_New_York.html,"Brooklyn, New York",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Tip-top brunch in a homey setting,"We stopped here midday Sunday for brunch. Plenty of outdoor seating, but all taken; we were the sole indoor diners.

We had typical brunch food: an omelette, bacon, toast, potatoes, greek yogurt, fresh juices. The menu is not large, but each of these things was perfectly made.

We also had their house-made Bloody Marys, which were well into ""best of breed"" territory.

Good, friendly service, good food, great value.",October 2020,Vinegar Hill House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60827-d1437886-Reviews-Vinegar_Hill_House-Brooklyn_New_York.html,"Brooklyn, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Very tasty house-made pastas,"We arrived in NYC on the later side, and checked into a nearby hotel. It was too late to get one of their outdoor tables, so we decided to share 3 pasta dishes as takeout:
* Spinach and ricotta gnocchi
* Pappardelle with tomato and thyme
* Fettuccine with braised rabbit

They were all delicious and completely different from each other: pillowy gnocchi, brightly flavored tomato sauce, deeply flavored rabbit ragu.

We even managed to order a bottle of wine as takeout as well.

Definitely a good place, would like to eat in there sometime.",October 2020,Pepolino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d423293-Reviews-Pepolino-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good coffee and terrific baked goods,"We had several different coffees over several biscuits: iced coffee, iced espresso, cappuccino, straight-up drop coffee; they were all very good. The iced quad-shot espresso might have been overdoing it a bit. :-)

The pastries are pretty exceptional. They have both ""scones"" and ""biscuits"", but I can't tell them apart from each other. No matter, because they're all super buttery, super tender, and delicious. Their banana bread is another stand-out: very moist (even the next day) and with an intense banana flavor.

Great place for breakfast, for sure.",August 2020,PK Coffee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57415-d10082329-Reviews-PK_Coffee-Stowe_Vermont.html,"Stowe, Vermont",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Copious amounts of hearty food,"First, the downside: outdoor seating in a parking lot. I guess you do what you have to do.

The upside: good food, reasonably prices, huge portions (nice after a long AM hike). I had fire-roastde duck, which was excellent; and fire-roasted vegetables, which were also excellent. She had fire-roasted salmon, which was (shocker) excellent.

We started with their fire-roasted nachos (seeing a theme here?), which was a gigantic platter of ""we can't stop eating these"" chips plus all the (vegetarian) fixings. Delicious.",August 2020,The Bench,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57415-d7153381-Reviews-The_Bench-Stowe_Vermont.html,"Stowe, Vermont",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Large outdoor seating area in a garden setting,"We really liked the garden setting here, and the food was perfectly good ""pub food"". My burger was excellent, as was her salmon. Delicious french fries.

I tried two of their beers, an IPA and a sour wheat beer. They were both excellent: cool, hazy, well balanced, and very refreshing.",August 2020,Idletyme Brewing Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57415-d8809208-Reviews-Idletyme_Brewing_Company-Stowe_Vermont.html,"Stowe, Vermont",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Tasty pizza with fresh ingredients,"We went here as a ""Plan B"", but were happy to find very tasty pizza.

Beautiful forested park,"Rt 108 through the Notch is an awesome drive, and the state park that's nestled at the top is really beautiful.

We walked up the steep trail to Sterling Pond. The trail is well maintained, but it's wet and can be slippery. And the start is genuinely steep.

The 1.5 mile walk up rewards you with Sterling Pond, a pretty little alpine pond. We went for a quick chilly swim, which felt great on a warm summer morning.

Rock climbing is doable on the other side of 108, but the rock doesn't look like it ever gets really dry. Winter ice climbing there is even better.",August 2020,Smugglers Notch State Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57415-d105551-Reviews-Smugglers_Notch_State_Park-Stowe_Vermont.html,"Stowe, Vermont",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Steep, well maintained ascent to a great view","We were early arrivals to the tiny parking lot at the trailhead. The walk starts gently through a dense marshy meadow, then gradually ascends through forest. About 2/3 of the way to the top it becomes quite steep; the average grade is close to 20% (1500 feet in 1.5 miles). Once at the top you are rewarded with a spectacular panoramic view of the entire valley.

Well worth the 2.5 hours round trip. It was a dog party at the top by the time we left; it seems everyone wanted to take their pup up to the top.",August 2020,Stowe Pinnacle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57415-d13072268-Reviews-Stowe_Pinnacle-Stowe_Vermont.html,"Stowe, Vermont",attractions,5.0,5.0
Comfortable inn in a nice location,"The Hob Knob has been around for quite a long time now. It's not a ""fancy"" place, but it's friendly and comfortable and in a location that's both convenient and quiet. And it's dog-friendly, which matters to us because we've now got a dog.

We splurged on a suite with a porch overlooking the meadow on the other side of Rt 108, and definitely got our money's worth – large bedroom, large bathroom, and a large living dining area. The furnishing are simple and cozy; we felt at home.",August 2020,"Hob Knob Inn, Bar & Lounge",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g57415-d252425-Reviews-Hob_Knob_Inn_Bar_Lounge-Stowe_Vermont.html,"Stowe, Vermont",hotels,4.0,4.0
Cove in the Time of Corona,"We checked the National Seashore website to ensure Herring Cove would be open before we made the drive. It's open to a point – the snack bar seems to be closed and the inside showers are as well (outdoor ones are in operation), and there are no lifeguards. (There might be at Race Point?) That being said, the beach itself is open.

The parking lot was maybe 1/4 full when we arrived at about 10am. When we got onto the beach, there were a fair number of people who were making some effort to keep themselves separated, but honestly it was too close for our comfort. We always walk 10-15 minutes down the beach; at this end, the closest neighbors were 40-50 feet or more. It's also where we're comfortable going nude/topless (me/her). Several people stopped by to ask if we ever got hassled for this (nope, not for the past 5-6 years anyway); a few others joined in, but nobody much cares (if anything, even more of the ""nobody much cares"" than ever).

When we left at about 2pm, the north end of the beach was getting quite a lot more crowded, and it was actually tough to maintain a respectable distance getting back to the car.

On the whole, it's business as usual, but it would maybe be better if the folks by the beach entrance made the effort to spread out a bit more.",July 2020,Herring Cove Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g41778-d105420-Reviews-Herring_Cove_Beach-Provincetown_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html,"Provincetown, Massachusetts",attractions,5.0,4.5
Canteen COVID edition,"Canteen has always had long lines and been jammed with people in its lovely garden, so we were unsure what to expect.

We were happy to see (roughly) the same menu with no loss of quality. If anything, they manage ro execute better; it seems like they've really focused on their mise-en-place, so the food comes out really quickly.

We expected not to be able to sit in that back garden, but no worries. No more long communal table, but a lot of 2- and 4-person tables nicely spaced.

This is one of the really good places in P'town, go give them your support.",July 2020,Canteen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41778-d4311594-Reviews-Canteen-Provincetown_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html,"Provincetown, Massachusetts",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Joe Coffee, COVID edition","Joe Coffee is a place we often visit for breakfast or coffee and snacks. The lines are as long as ever, but people are 6' apart. The coffee and pastries remain excellent. And the patio is still a fine place to sit, although less densely packed than in previous years.

Provincetown during COVID-19,"We love P'town both in and out of season; this year, we wondered if COVID-19 would turn it into a ghost town. No worries, though; it's true that on a warm Saturday, it was not nearly as crowded as most of our other summer visits. That being said, it is less crowded and generally quieter; not so many people, all in summer clothes and masks. Most of the shops are open, but since many are quite small, the number of people allowed in is restricted.

My take is: go visit, enjoy the lighter crowds, support the P'town community and merchants.",July 2020,Commercial Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g41778-d293651-Reviews-Commercial_Street-Provincetown_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html,"Provincetown, Massachusetts",attractions,5.0,4.5
Second review – even better a few years later,"I wrote a review of Dose a few years back shortly after it opened. Now they have a working kitchen, but the same sensibilities. A laid-back hipsterish vibe (in a good way), excellent music, delicious homemade pastries, and exceptional coffee.

Such a beautiful walk literally minutes from the town center,"I spotted a boardwalk while driving into town, so decided to see where it led.

Artisanal coffee roaster in Canmore,"There are two locations, a shiny new hangout on Main St, and a more industrial space with on-premises roasting on Bow Valley. I preferred the Bow Valley location, but to each his own.

What counts here is the coffee: single-source beans from all over the map (including India, yay!), carefully roasted, and turned into drinks by well-trained baristas.

La Baguette (in Revelstoke town),"A few years back, I wrote a review of the La Baguette shop at Revelstoke Mountain; it's a good place, but the main branch in Revy town is much better in every way.

First, it's just a much nicer, roomier space. The tables made of cross-sections of trees and polished concrete are beautiful. There's a cozy area with a fireplace. The menu is much more extensive, and there are breads and pastries to take away.

We've had a few meals there this week, and everything has been uniformly very good: the coffees, sandwiches, breakfasts, and snacks.

Delicious thin-crust wood-fired pizza,"We ordered takeout from RMFC and were not disappointed.

"We were skeptical, but now we're converts","When we see a menu that has all kinds of dishes from all over the map, we're a bit skeptical because it's so easy to do a half-baked job with menus like that. This is not the case at Crazy Weed.

We got delicious Burmese-style fish and shrimp cakes with very authentic tasting broth. She got the pan-roasted char, which was crispy-skinned and delicious. My double-cut pork chop was tender and smoky and wonderful, and the sides it came with were even better. Desserts were terrific as well.

The wine list is extensive and well chosen, too.

Superb French bakery and patisserie in Canmore,"We dropped by here after a day of skiing for a pre-dinner snack, and have now been back 3 more times in 3 days.

The breads are excellent, especially both the plain and country baguettes, which are as good as I've had anywhere. The croissants are flaky, buttery and delicious. And the other viennoiseries, especially the mousse cakes, are incredible.

First-rate Italian food at the Charles Hotel,"I've been a regular at Giulia in Cambridge for many years now, and had not yet gotten around to going to Benedetto, its younger sister restaurant at the Charles Hotel. Silly me, because it's not quite the same thing, and it's very very good.

What's the same: the obsessive focus on super fresh ingredients and outstanding homemade pasta.

What's different: a lovely quiet dining room, more – and more attentive – waitstaff, a very lengthy wine list, and fancier desserts.

Bonus points: even in the swanky Charles Hotel, it's barely more expensive than Giulia.

We had ricotta and pistachio crostini, a crudo (always a great choice at Giulia, and here as well), a vast plate of prosciutto and figs (outstanding), roasted squash agnolotti, and tagliatelle with ragu bolognese. Both pasta dishes were top-shelf. We splurged on two desserts, one with sesame (to be honest, this didn't float our boat) and a chocolate ""budino"" with black pepper crumble and fig gelato, which was amazingly good.

Highly recommended. Don't wait as long as we did to go.",December 2019,Benedetto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60890-d12063620-Reviews-Benedetto-Cambridge_Massachusetts.html,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Southeast Asian ""fusion"" in former Pho House space","We ate here the other night in a group of six people, so got to try quite a few dishes. I really enjoyed it because the flavor profiles are different from most of the other Thai, Vietnamese, etc places around here.

There were a number of standout dishes, especially the various dumplings, the roasted duck salad, and the crispy whole fish. The rendang-style beef cheeks were insanely rich, but not as dry-cooked as you usually find then; delicious anyway.

Friendly service, fills up quickly.

Lots of shops, restaurants, a lovely river front, beautiful streets and squares. This is a nice place.

That being said, as far as we can tell, there's a bit less there than meets the eye. We were there for about 2.5 days, and unlike in many places, this seemed like enough.",September 2019,Ljubljana Old Town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274873-d298666-Reviews-Ljubljana_Old_Town-Ljubljana_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good restaurant on a busy street serving game,"Lots of wild game dishes on the menu here! We had locally caught lake fish and local venison. Slightly prickly service, but well prepared food and good wine choices. We were pretty much the only people here not speaking German. Good place to go if you're near Bled and want good food at more reasonable prices.",September 2019,Gostisce Tulipan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1077238-d1153947-Reviews-Gostisce_Tulipan-Lesce_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,"Lesce, Slovenia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Super cool alchemy museum,"Who even knew there were any serious alchemy museums? This one covers several floors, is filled with interesting exhibits and information, and if you're in Radovljica, you should definitely stop here.",September 2019,Museum of Pharmacy and Alchemy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274879-d17630699-Reviews-Museum_of_Pharmacy_and_Alchemy-Radovljica_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,"Radovljica, Slovenia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Beautiful little town,"The small, walled Radovljika old town is absolutely worth a stop if you're anywhere in the area.

Cozy place in a picturesque town serving decent food,"This is one of those places that we wanted to be better, because it is a nice homey setting in a lovely town and friendly service. (And the gingerbread museum downstairs is good fun as well.) In fact, the food is only pretty good; it's arguably authentic, but the preparations could really have been more skilled. I'd recommend it anyway, it's good and good value for the money.",September 2019,Gostilna Lectar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274879-d740070-Reviews-Gostilna_Lectar-Radovljica_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,"Radovljica, Slovenia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Waterfall that comes straight out of the middle of a rock face,"Once you've parked in the lot at the far end of Lake Bohinj, you can head up to this waterfall. This entails going up, and down, many hundreds of steps. It's worth it, because the waterfall itself is well over 200 feet high and comes out of the middle of an otherwise blank face of rock. We've never seen anything quite like it.",September 2019,Waterfall Savica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274865-d1848881-Reviews-Waterfall_Savica-Bohinjsko_Jezero_Upper_Carniola_Region.html,"Bohinjsko Jezero, Slovenia",attractions,4.0,4.0
Extraordinary mountain park,"Yes, Lake Bled is beautiful, and everyone has heard of Bohinj as well. But this place, Triglav National Park, is extraordinary. There's some good climbing here. And hiking. And the scenery is magnificent.

"It really is lovely, even if it's a touristy hot-spot","This is a beautiful place but I don't know if we'd visit it in the high season.

Terrific restaurant in the Savoia Excelsior,"We were pretty tired from a long day of driving, and decided on a whim to have dinner at the Savoy. Good call! It's not worth reciting the menu because it apparently changes quite often, but everything we had was expertly prepared from top-shelf local ingredients. Everything was exceptional. This is an excellent restaurant, and – like the hotel itself – it is very reasonably priced given just how good it is.",September 2019,Savoy Restaurant by Eataly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187813-d4170108-Reviews-Savoy_Restaurant_by_Eataly-Trieste_Province_of_Trieste_Friuli_Venezia_Giulia.html,"Trieste, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Luxurious hotel in an awesome waterfront location,"This is an old-school luxury hotel in a fantastic building with great views overlooking the harbor. We had a waterfront-facing suite that provided front-row seats for the Bora, which blew in one of the afternoons we were staying.

The room itself was both luxurious and restrained. The service was low-key and perfect. And the price here was remarkably good for the quality.

Highly recommended, worth a splurge.",September 2019,Savoia Excelsior Palace – Starhotels Collezione,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187813-d203235-Reviews-Savoia_Excelsior_Palace_Starhotels_Collezione-Trieste_Province_of_Trieste_Friuli_Venezi.html,"Trieste, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
Outstanding seafood!,"A free glass of prosecco got us prepared for the excellent seafood that followed. We followed the recommendations of the waiter (owner?) and he served us several different courses of freshly caught fish. A dish of tuna prepared in three different ways was particularly good.

There are not really any fancy preparations here; they let the quality of the ingredients speak for themselves. This is someplace to check out if you can manage to get a table.",September 2019,Tutto Bene,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303833-d8659816-Reviews-Tutto_Bene-Rovinj_Istria.html,"Rovinj, Croatia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Croatian/Italian food in a family-run setting,"Konoba Jure is located about 1km outside of the old tow in a quiet residential area. It's in a cozy, semi-underground location.

The food is that awesome Istrian combination of Italian and Croatian food. We started with ravioli with loads of Istria truffles, an enormous Croatian-style fish soup; then onto grilled fish (for her) and tagliata (thinly sliced grilled beef – probably ribeye) for me.

Everything was excellent from start to finish, with friendly service, and a very modest bill at the end. This is the kind of place I'd love to has as a restaurant in my neighborhood.",September 2019,Konoba Jure,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303833-d4607198-Reviews-Konoba_Jure-Rovinj_Istria.html,"Rovinj, Croatia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Such a lovely town!,"I don't know what this town is like during the high season, but in early September it was lovely.

Hearty food for a cool evening,"This was just what we needed for a cool rainy evening – hearty plentiful food from an open grill, and Croatian red wines. She had a grilled trout, I had spit-roasted pork with shatteringly crisp skin. And lots of delicious potatoes. This is not a ""gourmet"" destination, but the food is very tasty and satisfying, especially after a day of hiking.",September 2019,Bistro Vila Velebita,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g670798-d1830024-Reviews-Bistro_Vila_Velebita-Korenica_Lika_Senj_County.html,"Korenica, Croatia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Amazing! Never seen anything like this,"We spent about 4 hours taking a walk of 5-6 miles around several of the lakes here. It's amazing, we've never seen so much beauty crammed into so little space. The perfect weather and lack of crowds were bonus points. It's hard not to take dozens of photos here. Well worth the journey from the coast to see this.",September 2019,Plitvice Lakes National Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303827-d554038-Reviews-Plitvice_Lakes_National_Park-Plitvice_Lakes_National_Park_Central_Croatia.html,"Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia",attractions,5.0,4.5
