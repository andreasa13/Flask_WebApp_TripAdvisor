Can’t believe we were really here!!!,The Acropolis is breathtaking. The fact that something is so old and so well preserved and that we could explore all around it was mind boggling. Our hotel had a view of the Acropolis and the view at night was stunning. Everywhere in the city you only had to look up and be amazed.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
The perrrrrfect foodie tour of Athens with AFT and Georgia,"I can still hear Georgia Kalimeri and her perfectly rolled rrrrrrrs telling us what a perfect group we were and how perrrfect (keep rolling the rs, you get the point) our donuts and coffees and teas and saffron purchases and olives, cheeses and breads and ice creams were that we enjoyed that day. It truly was a perfect way to experience the local Athenian market and see and taste how fresh and delicious their foods are. Georgia’s enthusiasm for her work and her pride in her city and culture were infectious and we felt like we were more than tourists, we were Greeks enjoying the sights, sound and foods of “our” city. She in fact called us “her people.” (“My people, come tp me! You’ll love this; it is perfect!”) This was one of our favorite parts of our holiday in Greece all because of Georgia and her delightful zest for life, people, food and fun. This is a “must”. and Georgia was our very own muse.",October 2019,Athens Food Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d3198860-Reviews-Athens_Food_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Lovely hotel in the heart of the Acropolis area,"We spent three nights at the Hera Hotel this week and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is boutique style and the staff are warm and accommodating and English speaking as a bonus. Our Jr suite had a king size bed and a balcony with a view of the Acropolis, as did the Peacock lounge on the top floor where we enjoyed happy hours drinks and a snack. The breakfast buffet is very nice and the wait staff were especially helpful in teaching us some Greek words. The hotel is centrally located near fine tavernas and attractions.

Beautiful Southern home and formal gardens on the Ashley River,"The azaleas were exploding with color during our visit to Middleton earlier this month. And we couldn't walk near a body of water without seeing an alligator, or two, or three, basking on the sunny banks. They left us alone and we did the same to them. But how cool to see them enjoying such a beautiful place. The house tour is informative and the home itself is beautiful. The highlights of the estate are the many garden and pond areas with beautiful formal gardens as well as meadows and park settings. Absolutely gorgeous afternoon.

Anna is the sweetest person in the world and makes you feel so at home as she piles large scoops of ice cream into cups, cones and shakes.

The home of gorgeous Gullah art and prints,"Being new to the lowcountry, I'd seen Gullah art in various homes and shops and read about Jonathon Green and his famous Gullah art work.

"Outdoor dining right off the beach, what's not to love?!!!","We brought friends here February 7 and it was a gorgeous 65 degree day in Pawleys Island. We sat outdoors in the sun and drank draft beers while we waited for our meals. The crab cake over succotash was delicious, and being from Maryland, I'm kind of a crab cake snob, but this was so tasty. The Cabana burger was big and juicy and perfectly cooked. The bronzed grouper and fried grouper baskets were also good choices. The fish was fresh, the batter was light and crispy and the cole slaw and fries were tasty too.

Another wonderful meal at Cru Cafe!,"Cru Cafe is quickly becoming one of favorite restaurants in Charleston. We were celebrating the birthday of a friend who'd not been to Charleston before who wanted something ""traditionally Southern"" but quirky and fun. Cru was perfect.

We started out the meal with Fried Green Tomatoes, of course! and some fat and fresh white wine truffled Mussels complete with delicious bread for dipping in the sauce. Our entrees included the thai seafood risotto, parmesan potato gnocchi, braised lamb shanks and the red snapper fish of the day and each dish was perfectly prepared and enjoyed. Katie was helpful with picking our sparkling wine and other drink choices and she was attentive to our request for a birthday dessert for my friend...a flourless chocolate torte complete with a candle.

Delicious seafood and our new favorite shrimp and grits in town,"My husband and I dined here last week and had a wonderful meal. Jeff orders shrimp and grits in every restaurant in Charleston determined to find the best....High Cotton is his new favorite. Creamy grits with lots of juice to dip bread in and huge, fresh and flavorful shrimp. We started our meal with baked oysters and they were large and delicious. I had the fish special for that evening. A whole snapper, served bone in, perfectly flaky and fresh served with a wonderful sauce. We shared bowls of broccolini and roasted brussel sprouts...try them even if you're not a fan of brussel sprouts, they were so tasty. We split a coconut cream pie for dessert...with a coconut crust, yum! We already made reservations to go back over New Years.

Le Foodist made us feel very French and very competent in the kitchen....EXCELLENT class!,"Our group of 10 took the Paris metro from the Arc to Le Foodist (which was a fun adventure in itself) and arrived 15 minutes late to our appoiintment. Fred, our chef said ""no problem, you're on Paris time"" so we immediately felt comfortable. After coffee, Fred explained we'd be touring the market area to purchase food that we would come back and prepare for our lunch. Fred is extremely knowledgeable about Paris, French cooking, fresh foods, especially the cheeses, and our tour was so informative and fun. After about 45 minutes we headed back to Le Foodist where he broke us into pairs of two to prepare our meal. Mussels marinieres, gratin dauphinois (to die for potatoes!), coq au vin and poire belle helene (pears in chocolate sauce). Fred showed us how to chop more efficiently, how to make a wine reduction sauce that you could eat with a spoon as a meal, and how to cook chicken by sous vide (boiling it in saran wrap, amaziing!) The entire cooking class was 6 hours, including our amazing lunch that we feasted on with good wines and excellent conversation. I can't recommend this experience enough. It's a wonderful taste, literally, of French cooking and the professional kitchen with it's induction cooktops was clean, orderly and so accessible. We felt like Julia Childs.

Enzo and his staff created a lasting heirloom and treasure from our trip to Positano,"I've never gone on vacation overseas and purchased furniture, I mean, who does that? LOL But when we were looking in Positano for a beautiful ceramic piece to take home as a souvenir of that beautiful place, our travel agent sent us to Emporio della Ceramica and the wonderful Enzo. We scoured every inch of his beautiful two level showroom and kept coming back to the beautiful 42 inch painted lava table tops. We thought, this will be a FOREVER souvenir we will actually use everyday in our new beach home. Enzo spent over an hour with us discussing the ways we could customize it and set about to setting up delivery, etc. He threw in a lovely tile that said ""Villa Herwig"" for our new home. It took 4 months to get the table delivered to SC but we had told Enzo we didn't need it before Christmas so we were fine waiting until later. One of the table legs was broken, which was hard to believe considering how sturdily everything was crated and wrapped. It was a several hundred pound delivery, but Enzo quickly had a new table frame shipped to us. He was always quick to respond to our inquiries and the resulting piece is nothing short of stunning! My husband had ordered a matching water much to my surprise and it too is a masterpiece. Thank you to Enzo and your amazing artisans.

"The mansion is even more stunning than the gardens, which I thought would be impossible.","My husband and I traveled back to Hillwood Museum and Gardens this past glorious weekend in DC and toured the mansion which had not previously done. The guided tour was so interesting and the mansion is filled to bursting with portraits, beautiful porcelain, statues and elegant furnishings. The dining room is stunning and I so wanted to sit at the elaborate table and enjoy a meal in the gorgeous setting. Marjorie Merriwether Post was a fascinating woman and her collection of Russian artifacts going back to the Czars is so impressive. There are two beautiful Faberge eggs among her collection of jeweled porcelains and they do not disappoint. We were told there only 50 produced, and she owned 2 of them. Allow yourself extra time to go through the mansion on your own after your tour to see up close all the extravagant pieces in the glass cases. And again we enjoyed a picnic lunch on the gorgeous terrace overlooking the sloping lawn.

One of our favorite restaurants in Fort Lauderdale,"This is one of our ""go to"" restaurants every time we visit Fort Lauderdale. There's something for everyone. When our kids were little we ate outside on the deck so they could watch and feed the huge tarpon that swim around right next to your tables.

"Beautiful, modern hotel hidden away just a block from the beach","Our first trip to Key West was fabulous due in great part to this gem of a hotel. We stayed in a ground floor two bedroom suite right near the hotel pool. The amenities are lovely. The rooms are beautiful, the beds comfortable, the kitchen and sitting areas are lovely and the hotel is so quiet! We enjoyed happy hour everyday at the pool with sangria, wine and specialty drinks and snacks. The sushi restaurant that is adjoining the hotel is fab!! Such fresh fish and wonderful sushi combinations. We were just two blocks off Duvall Street but felt like we were miles away because it was so nice and secluded on our block. We could walk to the Butterfly museum, the southernmost point and all the great bars and restaurants and then return to our hotel for a swim and cocktails. Such a great place!

Such a disappointment....and expensive,"Four of us came to dine here with high hopes and only one of us really had a decent meal. My homemade pasta dish with truffle sauce was truly delicious and reminded me of the fresh pasta and sauce I tasted in Italy last fall. My friends were not so lucky. Our pate appetizer was too tiny for two to share, as was most of the food offerings. The waitress warned us the portions were ""European"" in size, but we didn't think we'd leave hungry. My friend who ordered short ribs had four literal BITES of meat on top of a smear of potato. The poor guy was so hungry. None of the other entrees were distinguishable except that they were all expensive and very small portions. The setting is pretty and we were in the courtyard on a nice evening.

My husband and I have been coming to Antrim, and bringing dozens of people here, for the past 20 years. This past weekend we hosted a wine dinner for 6 couples in their fabulous wine cellar. It was gorgeous in there....crystal, flowers, good friends, great wine selections by Greg and wonderful service and conversation from our servers Sarah and Alicia...all the makings of a perfect night. The food was disappointing...mostly because there wasn't much of it. I know the trend is less food, more creativity and quality, farm to table etc, etc., but one shouldn't leave a 6 course meal hungry. We were huge Michael Gettier fans while he was at Antrim and we enjoyed Spencer Wolf's menu for the most part but this was a big change from what we've become accustomed. From the miniscule, although tasty hand-passed hors d'oeuvres during cocktails, to the miniature amuse bouche (I know it's just a taste, but this was hardly a nibble and only left you wanting something substantive). I remember getting a beautifully prepared oyster or shrimp on Chef Michael Gettier's watch. My fried shrimp appetizer was tasty but the shrimp were small and the slaw that accompanied it was a teaspoon's worth. The lobster bisque was well done and my filet was perfectly cooked but accompanied only by a smear of potatoes. My husband wasn't excited by his salmon appetizer or his lamb entree...again, tasty food but too creative and not enough for that price. We loved spending time in the pub and on the outdoor deck after dinner with drinks and cigars. The rooms in the mansion are wonderful, love that there's no TV, and the steam showers and fireplaces are lovely touches. The breakfast tray was fine in the morning, the muffins weren't as good as they used to be sadly. The hot breakfast was tasty but nothing special. The bacon and fried potatoes were good (oh how I miss the mixture of sweet and white breakfast potatoes Antrim used to swerve!) The egg and cheese frittatta was pretty bland and not cheesy. Our server kept the hot coffee flowing so that was a plus! Again, there are 100 things I love about Antrim, and I will be definitely be back to spend a night, but I may not be dining here anytime soon and that saddens me.",January 2017,Antrim 1844,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g41399-d77557-Reviews-Antrim_1844-Taneytown_Maryland.html,"Taneytown, Maryland",hotels,4.0,4.5
The gardens are amazing!,"Who knew such a beautiful home and gardens was tucked away in Silver Spring MD? Had our first (of many to come!) visit to Hillwood this weekend on a perfect fall day, sunny and mild. The grounds of Hillwood are so beautiful to walk and wander through. We were advised to bring a picnic and enjoyed eating overlooking the terrace and the greens. There are wonderful little places to sit on Ms. Merriweather's outdoor furniture, or bring a blanket and enjoy the lovely lawns. The Japanese garden with its fountains is so beautiful and relaxing. The rose garden still had plenty of beautiful blooms in mid October and the forest walk is enchanting. Sadly we spent so much time outside that we have to come back to tour the inside of this beautiful place.

So glad to have found this deli on the way to DC,"We used trip advisor and found this very popular deli on our way to visit Hillwood Estate in Silver Spring, MD. What a fabulous carry out lunch we enjoyed! The turkey and brie with cranberry sauce is Thanksgiving day between bread...delicious. The grilled Reuben sandwich was packed with the most tasty and tender corned beef...these are hearty sandwiches! We could have shared one, but I was grateful to have the leftovers for lunch the next day. You can call ahead with an order, but we didn't wait long when we just walked in to order. They also have a nice selection of wines, cold beer and soft drinks to add to your meal, along with desserts and salads. Great place.

One of the highlights of our day touring Montepulciano,"Our tour group of 8 had lunch here before we started wine tasting at the wineries in the piazza. So glad we did. What a delicious meal. I had ravioli with a truffle sauce accompanied by a delicious house white wine. All the pasta dishes were traditional and fresh. A few in our group loved the beef they got. Because we didn't have reservations we couldn't sit on the outside terrace which is high up with gorgeous views, however the inside of the restaurant is lovely with walls lined with lovely bottles of wine.

Beautiful hotel in the heart of Rome,"We stayed 2 nights at the hotel before taking a train to Tuscany. Our first morning off the plane, we walked to a nearby cafe for breakfast and were able to check in to our room by 11 am...very nice. The staff was very helpful with travel and tour arrangements around town and with restaurant reservations, etc. The bed was wonderful and the room nicely appointed although there were lots of light switches to figure out. The rooftop bar at nice has amazing views, delicious food and great drinks. The breakfast came as part of our reservation and was delicous and fresh.

The ceilings alone are jaw dropping and the sculpture and painting collection feature Bernini, whose Apollo and Daphne is exquisite, while other paitings by Titian, Carravagio, Raphael and DaVinci also delight. The self walking tour is very informative and the quality of the recorded material is excellent. Give yourself 2 hours to listen and see everything. The grounds surrounding the Gallery are picturesque and there are several lovely ponds. The Gallery is renovating the gardens attached to the home which should be lovely once finished.

"Worth all the great reviews. Great food, atmosphere and wine","We went to see the Trevi Fountain, of course, but our other mission upon going there was to find this Prosciutteria after reading such great reviews about it here. It was AMAZING. It's a tiny, quirky place walled with wine bottles whose tables and chairs are boxes...so charming. We found a great place in the back for the 4 of us and ordered a large plank of meats, cheeses, grilled veggies....about !0 Euros per person, great deal and delicious red wine and prosecco too. What they put before us was a work of art...and so delicious. We got there around 6:30 which is early for dinner in Italy and why we were able to get a seat I believe.

"Great food, great location, delightful in every way","We dined at La Pergola our first night in Positano. We were ""hangry"" and wanted something simple and Italian, but not pasta, so PIZZA of course. This is probably the best pizza I've had (sorry Tres Sorelle, but you're a close second). Our waiter was friendly and put up with our sad Italian 01 efforts. The prosecco was cold and crisp and the meal was the perfect ""first night"" in this enchanted sea town.

The perfect end to our stay in beautiful Eden Roc and Positano,"We saved dinner at our hotel restaurant for our last night in Positano. It was an EVENT. We were seated at 7pm at the front corner table (best in the house it seemed) overlooking lovely the sea...as the sun set and the lights came on on the beach and hillside the view was stunning over the water. For the next 3 hours we relaxingly feasted on the freshest seafood, vegetables and pasta imaginable. When I asked about the daily fish, a sterling silver tray was brought out featuring the fresh catch in all it's lovely, raw glory and I was able to select the dorado I wanted for my meai. We enjoyed beef carpacio, fresh ravioli with the lightest tomato sauce and amazing cheese, the dorado and a delightful tiramisu. The wine and prosecco were delicious. The service was attentive and polite but not intrusive. The three hours we spent here were so special. I would call this a definite MUST if you're visiting Positano.",September 2016,Adamo ed Eva by Eden Roc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g194863-d3168945-Reviews-Adamo_ed_Eva_by_Eden_Roc-Positano_Amalfi_Coast_Province_of_Salerno_Campania.html,"Positano, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5

After around many winding steps and paths we happily came across this restaurant near the ""locals beach"" and were treated to a table on the vine covered terrace overlooking the sea and beach. It was stunning. We started with caprese salad and and each got pasta. I chose homemade papparedelle pasta with tomatoes and cheese. And my husband got the pasta with puttanesca sauce.

The cooking/touring week of a lifetime in belle Tuscany!,"My husband and I had been planning a trip to Italy for YEARS! We chose September to celebrate his 60th anniversary with a week in Tuscany doing a cooking/sightseeing tour and then a week on the Amalfi Coast. Our week at Villa Schiatti was perfection! Aleen and Grazia and Laura took such excellent care of us all week and chef Mariella taught us to make wonderful Tuscan delicasies...ravioli, octopus stew, Tuscan almond cookies (biscotti) and so much more. The rooms at the Villa are quaint and comfortable with nice hot showers and good mattresses. Lovely breezes blew in at night and there were beautiful sunsets over the olive trees and cypresses. Grazia was so helpful in making almost impossible reservations at the Uffizi and the Accademie. She spent hours on the computer and phone helping us secure the tickets we needed. She also helped us with train tickets and ANY thing else we asked for. We enjoyed talking with her in the evenings...she was learning English and we were learning Italian. Aleen was a wondeful tour guide, sommelier and host in the dining room. He drove us all over Tuscany and was so patient as we asked him to stop the car for photographs in sunflower fields, cypress lined streets and vineyards. He recommended some great wines for us to try during the week (Poliziano!) and he was funny, accommodating and so knowledgeable about everything we toured. He even translated for our cooking lessons with Chef Maria. There were 8 of us on this particular tour and it was the perfect number for dining, touring and socializing with all week. We made new friends and shared so many lovely adventures in Assisi, Montepulciano, Perugia (the Perugina chocolate tour is great!) Siena, and the truffle hunt we went on was so fun and informative. Eating a meal prepared with the truffles the dogs found for us was an added treat at the Boscovino olive oil plant. For our free day we took the train to Florence, thanks to Grazia's help, and came back to the villa that evening for a wonderful gourmet meal. The breakfasts each day were delicious, so much to choose from, and our dinners were excellent...whether we helped cooked them or it was all the chef, the food was fresh, hot and authentically Italian and delicious. Come here and cook and delight in the beauty of the villa and it's grounds and pool and eat ""grandmother's cake""....it's life changing! This was a fabulous trip and we can't say enough wonderful things about the staff that served us all week.

Bang bang shrimp and rare tuna nachos are becoming my favorite things on the menu. There's a great selection of beers on draft, etc. There was a good band and it was a beautiful night to sit outside in the yard.
