Lovely beach and great hospitality,"We stayed for 2 weeks during Xmas time. They have very nice pools - private, villa and a common one; and of course the hotel beach. Hotel staff is very friendly and cordial. To name few individuals for their excellent services : Zed,Saurav,Nisu,Sabin,Jenny,Ripsu,Bow,Pumkin,Ryan and Ruby. Breakfast area is lovely and live mild music was special treat. All in all fantastic place to stay and relax.

We however do have some recommendations for the resort staff.

1- please have shuttle service to the main ride more often than every two hours. It’s just bad and not properly lit during night - 1.5 km road to walk.
2-keep the restaurant prices a bit more attractive for the beach area.

Else, all good and great. And yes, your Xmas dinner program was very well done with all specials. Thank you for that.",December 2019,Santhiya Tree Koh Chang Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580110-d577083-Reviews-Santhiya_Tree_Koh_Chang_Resort-Ko_Chang_Trat_Province.html,"Ko Chang, Thailand",hotels,5.0,4.5
Awesome Indian food at relatively simple restaurant,"This is a hidden gem in Koh Chang. We tried other Indian restaurants but once we had dinner here , we went almost a week daily to the place.

Amazing food where I would not have thought of,Reached Dorint airport hotel in Stuttgart around 22:00 and thought of getting some basic food at hotel's fantastic bar/restaurant. There I found Kashmir restaurant with Indian food. Just 100 meter walk! Fantastic vegetarian food and basmati rice with whole cardamom was a delight.

"Awesome food, great service","Today by chance we walked into the restaurant Zafran . They created two Indian paneer based dishes even they were not on their menu.

Service not best and fast as expected,"flight service was very slow and it tooks the at least 4 passengers sitting in different corners of the plane for stewardess to realize that Flight's entertainment system was not working for a very long time after the doors were closed and flight took off. Also, the meal/drink service was delayed for no apparent reason. In short - did not feel that its a ""First class airlines"" !",December 2018,Qatar Airways,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729134-Reviews-Qatar-Airways,World,flights,3.0,4.0
Lots of choices of freshly prepared quality food and friendly service,"In our recent visit at Sheraton Koh Samui, we visited Coco Spice restaurant for breakfast regularly. It's a nice restaurant with great view. Freshly prepared warm breakfast and lots of variety of vegetarian dishes, with ever smiling faces of team working there made our day.

What struck me tge most was that Mr. Asker Bay, being executive Chef kept closed contact with all guests. Everyday he asked everyone of us whether we are enjoying breakfast, thus showing personal interest. Also, by and of breakfast time, he had his breakfast in the same hall where we had our breakfast. Thus showing ""he eats what he prepares"". Wonderful example of leadership in gastronomy!!

Great place with quality food and quality fresh juices..",December 2018,Coco Spice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g676072-d11046520-Reviews-Coco_Spice-Chaweng_Bophut_Ko_Samui_Surat_Thani_Province.html,"Chaweng, Thailand",restaurants,5.0,5.0

Amazing service + great location = Awesome experience (high recommendation) !!,"This is a great resort with lots of facilities. Multiple swimming pools (including huge infinity pool with a sea view) and on the beach provide great relaxation. Not too far from the Kos city (bus ride from in-front of hotel, 4 bus stations, 2 euro/person ticket). Perhaps all these, one can expect from a resort however, what stunned me is the level of personalised service. I can write an essay with lots of experience I have gather but I will focus on few individuals with whom we interacted the most. This does not mean that others were any less ..

Starting from reception : Alan : very friendly person with articulate conversation. Then we were brought to room with a golf cart and during the short ride, Gerorge explained all the facilities and specialities.

Breakfast: Eva Revani, Angelo, Hermes and others : read any need before we could express :) very friendly services. Big breakfast buffet and especially for a vegetarian person like me, lots of warm and cold choices. Freshly prepared healthy smoothies, and even champagne to delight.

Dinner: Lea, the hostess every day welcomed individually with a cocktail at dinner room. A very friendly person with big smile. My wife and I were always went in to the dinner room with happy face where we again had great choices (including vegetarian) food. Service from Alex and Geralda Torraj was lovely. Since terrace is preferred location for most of the guest for dinner, they managed the guest quick and very cordially. Of course, with big smile...

Beach side pool: Athena and Leola serve beverages, cocktails .. nice and happy person.

Evening bar: every day, there were different shows (Latin Dance, Greek Dance, Belly dance etc.) .. very professional and friendly dancers. They just did not perform and vanish .. they made sure that after every performance, the guest dance with them to make the environment livelier ..they provided basic lessons in these different dance style which made happy event for shaking the legs :) Alex, George were outstanding while serving variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks !

All in all : great people, finest food, many amenities gave us great one week of experience has certainly raised our expectation bar for other resorts in next vacation !!",July 2018,Michelangelo Resort and Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g663504-d1456006-Reviews-Michelangelo_Resort_and_Spa-Psalidi_Kos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Kós, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5

Disappointing in simple words ! Warning : Check your food for glass splinter and living ants before you eat !,"Big disappointment! Being at prime location, we assumed the food and services will be great ! we visited with big family for brunch. All in all - 10 people. In 10 dishes, following faults :
1) Living and moving Ant in Salad - Manager's explanation : we use fresh food so it can happen.
2) Glass splinter in drink - Manager's explanation : It's human, it can happen.
3) In a fruit pancake, no fruit: Manager's explanation : yes, but you got it after you complained.
4) In a egg item, egg was absent.: Manager's explanation : you did not complain about it.
5) Very hardened toast bread : Manager's explanation: none !

It took us a very long argument with the manager to convince her that this is not acceptable. In stead of saying - oh we are sorry and why don't you try our 3 euro ice-cream as our cordial apology, she was convincing that its your good right not to come here or not to recommend us further !! that was something ..

We as family agreed that all this hassle could have been forgotten and forgiven, if the manager would have tried to solve the issue in stead showing the attitude !

At least ""Spree Gold at Ku'damm"" is done for us ! Never again !",June 2018,Spreegold Bikini Berlin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d12332077-Reviews-Spreegold_Bikini_Berlin-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",restaurants,1.0,3.5

Wonderful place with great people,"i would recommend everyone to stay at The Lovina Resort ! People are very friendly, exceptional service, great location. Swimming pools (yes, two of them !) are big. Fitness room has decent equipment. Few supermarkets around here as well for grocery shopping, Surrounding is certainly not for people who want to have a busy, hectic and loud life (for that you should stay in Kuta). I can write more about resort, facilities and surrounding - but the most important experience we had was friendlies, eagerness to help and readiness to go an extra mile for customer satisfaction of the staff : be it a sweeper, room-cleaner, pool boy, receptionist or manager ! Once the pool boy even apologized that it rained on that day - can anyone be more expressive in worrying about happiness of the guests ?!
