"This is an English Pub, but not up to my pare.","The service was extremely slow in my opinion and my water glass was empty for longer periods of time. Secondly the portions were small in my opinion and the grease on just the onion rings was extremely extensive. So much so I could have taken the amount of grease on my hands and used it to oil my automobiles engine. This was to be an English publ and I have been to England and never had any grease on my deep fried food in England. Unfortunately I will not be back.

Because of the Pandemic we took the food back home.,"Because of the Pandemic we took the food back home. The taste was very good and the sandwich we had was their Grilled Grouper topped with coleslaw, 1000 island & Swiss cheese on rye bread. The size of the sandwich and amount of Grouper was generous but it was very expensive at $18.50 . However in my opinion the price of their onion ring appetizer served with petal sauce was very expensive at $7.50 for 6 small onion rings. Way too expensive for the quantity provided. They could have earned a 5 star for the quality but the excessive pricing in my opinion cost them one star plus the small portion of onion rings.",January 2021,Woody's River Roo Pub & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34204-d871706-Reviews-Woody_s_River_Roo_Pub_Grill-Ellenton_Florida.html,"Ellenton, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Great Taste but foul ups damage our first experience.,"We ordered online as we are in a pandemic.

We were 40 minutes from home and did not find out until we got home. The food we received tasted good but it was disappointing not to have any chips with the few salsa they gave us. My Chicken Quesadilla was cheese Quesadilla. My Chicken Relleno Pepper Topped with Ranchero Sauce was excellent, and my Chicken Enchiladas was tasty too.

I had been here previously 20 years ago and it was live music playing throughout and all the rides were open.

The stay was friendly and helpful. But the facility needs some work. I being a risk manager saw areas that needed attention, loose railings, broken steps on the Mayan tower. Not proper attention to the inflatable rafts which caused people to flip into the water.

You sign a very detailed release when you stay at this resort, and overall the area is well maintained and there are areas that could be improved in my opinion. But I am a risk manager and notice things others do not.

You can expect a great time, I just wish they let me know that most places and some water rides would be closed during my stay in advance.",December 2019,The Coral at Atlantis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147417-d675116-Reviews-The_Coral_at_Atlantis-Paradise_Island_New_Providence_Island_Bahamas.html,New Providence Island,hotels,4.0,3.5
A hotel in downtown Greece but with the American Traveler in mind,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a group and stayed there twice during our tour of Greece. The first time we had a room on the front of the hotel and the noise level was high from the travel on the main street in front of the hotel. The hotel was good quality and catered to the American tastes. We had facial tissue, face cloths and on the second stay we had a back room so we would not hear the sounds of the street. Very good service Definitely a 4-star hotel. I had insulin and an ice pack and they made sure it was taking care of plus each room had its own minibar which to put the insulin in to keep cool. They even had a scale in the room so I could weigh the luggage prior to our return to the airport for our trip back home.",May 2019,Athens Zafolia Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228892-Reviews-Athens_Zafolia_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0

This is a Red Roof Inn that needs to be updated and the smell removed.,"This is a Red Roof Inn that needs to be updated and the smell removed. We had to change our room and then next room had to be sprayed so we could stay in it. Smelled like wet dogs had been in the rooms for days. No lotion, facial tissue, However, the staff very courteous and helpful. Shower unit fell off in tub in the morning and we did not have time to get if fixed.

I for one love Texas Roadhouse.,"I for one love Texas Roadhouse, this time I was not excited with the quality of the food as I usually am. The steaks had to be sent back to be cooked to medium rare, rather than raw. The coleslaw was more mayo than cabbage, and the blooming onion was overcooked and crusty. This was a total shock as I have eaten here many times and never did this occur prior. The manager came and made it all ok but still was surprising.",November 2019,Texas Roadhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g39790-d15186128-Reviews-Texas_Roadhouse-Richmond_Kentucky.html,"Richmond, Kentucky",restaurants,3.0,4.0
