"Awesome restaurant, fantastic food and entertainment","We loved this restaurant so much we went back twice. The service is excellent and so is the food. All the serving staff is so helpful, funny and friendly. We enjoyed watching Greek dancing by the waiters, danced with other patrons and couldn’t be more pleased. The owner talked with us and walked around making sure all was well.

I highly recommend this restaurant.",October 2019,Blue Myth Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g659660-d1473431-Reviews-Blue_Myth_Restaurant-Platys_Gialos_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Nice spot, not quiet though, bugs in sink","We stayed two nights and while our view from the room was beautiful we most definitely could have done better. Our room was small, bathroom extremely small. No bar soap provided in the room. You had to shut the door just to use the commode. No coffee in room and we had bugs crawling out of our sink! Front staff friendly ness and helpfulness left much to be desired I was afraid to ask them for anything. Extremely unhelpful. We had asked about transportation to the shopping area and were told a shuttle or taxi for 40 Euros. What they failed to tell us is there is a public bus that goes into the town every 15 minutes for 1,80 Euros right around the corner. Our room was right behind the pool bar area and pool and it was so noisy at night with music until probably past 2:00 am it seemed like. If you want to lay out by pool where you don’t pay for the lounge chair you will have no view of the ocean as the view is blocked by the bar. If you want to stay on lounges you will pay at a minimum 40 Euro (depending on season and how close lounge is to water) to lay there.

We loved Mykonos, but next time we will know better to pick our hotel.

I would not recommend this hotel.",October 2019,Mykonos Palace Beach Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g659660-d234315-Reviews-Mykonos_Palace_Beach_Hotel-Platys_Gialos_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,2.0,4.0
"Amazing ruins, watch your step","We enjoyed visiting these famous ruins. Amazing there is still anything standing. I’m so glad we were not there during summer or it would have been crowded and miserable. Walkways leading to ruins are marble paved cobblestone and and quite slippery if stepped on so we tried to walk in between stones on dirt or gravel. My husband walks with a cane so he really had to watch his step. There is a store to buy drinks before you go in, don’t buy there unless your on your way out. When we asked if she had water she just said no she was out, but she neglected to tell us that we could buy water once inside at vending machines. We spent 20 euros on Gatorade thinking we could bring them in only to find out we couldn’t and had to throw it away. Make sure you have coins you can buy water once you get inside.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Modern boutique hotel, awesome staff!","This newly remodeled hotel is tucked away in a central location in Athens where you are walking distance or hop on an on and off bus to all attractions and shopping. The staff were all very attentive and welcoming. We stayed two nights and while our room was very small (Deluxe) it was clean and the bed was very, very comfortable. There was a leak from the shower in or room thought that we had to let staff know about. We had a partial view of the Acropolis on the hill top, but the ugly run down view of the building adjacent to the hotel detracted from that view. We were able to go on the rooftop of the hotel and grab a Mythos beer and enjoy a better view, which I thought was nice. The roof top is not a restaurant but you can bring food up there. If you have a disability that needs a larger elevator you may want to reach out to the hotel to see if your needs can be accommodated. Elevator was very small (only two people can fit).

The Main Street that the hotel is on is really, really sketchy and I’d avoid going down it to the city center. However, there are other streets that aren’t as bad and quite nice. There is a cafe next door to the restaurant that has baked goods and in the morning you can smell them. The cafe decorates in theme depending on the month. It was a Halloween theme when we were there.",October 2019,Athens Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d12293779-Reviews-Athens_Lodge-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Guiseppe our driver was great!,We used Guiseppe a couple of times and he was great! He stopped on the way to our hotel so we could take pictures and have a Limoncello. Friendly and a very good driver. We would definitely recommend him.,October 2019,Prestige Limo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187782-d10822958-Reviews-Prestige_Limo-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Sorrento, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
