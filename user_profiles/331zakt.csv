Good cheap food,We visited twice and had a fantastic time on both occasions! The waitress was very funny and spoke amazing English. The food was exceptional and very cheap! Best chips in Athens!,July 2018,Prigkipas Streetfood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12196869-Reviews-Prigkipas_Streetfood-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Worth the visit,"If you enjoy your Greek artefacts, sculptors and more then definitely go! It’s a big museum and if you’re checking out the Acropolis first wear comfy shoes! £5 entry to the museum no matter what ticket you get into the Acropolis.",July 2018,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Very busy and expensive,"The sight itself isn’t one you’d miss out when in Athens but that’s if if you can stick the €20 ticket price! We bought the €30 ticket that gets you into more places, it works out cheaper if you do visit them. Go later on at 2-3 pm, the suns still in the sky but it’s much quieter!!",July 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Good walk and views,"Lovely walk up the hill, some of the paths are shaded but that doesn’t help to much with the heat! Take lots of water and maybe a snack, the cafe was very expensive so we headed down and found somewhere on the lower streets. The views are fantastic and you get a real sense of the size of the city! Definitely recommend!",July 2018,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Recommend the visit,"Great to stroll around and lots to see, a lot greener than the acropolis and a lot less busier! Definitely put it on your list of things to see! We spent a few hours in there and had a lovely time.",July 2018,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice quiet place,"A lovely little apartment by the sea, just a 2 minuet walk down to the nearest beach and although small there are a few spots hidden away close by! The guys who own it are very friendly and very helpful, they even gave us a lift into town. Not lots around in terms of restaurants and such but it’s only a 30 bus ride from town and the buses are very cheap. The room was excellent and was cleaned everyday for us, fantastic place to stay would definitely recommend staying if you want a quiet little vacation.",July 2018,Manos Syros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g6212263-d2436637-Reviews-Manos_Syros-Megas_Gialos_Syros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Syros, Greece",hotels,4.0,5.0
Great beach bar,"We came here a few times as our apartment was just up the road, not badly priced and always something to eat. Just across from the beach so great views as you enjoy your food.",July 2018,Fuego,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6212263-d5777027-Reviews-Fuego-Megas_Gialos_Syros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Syros, Greece",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Beautiful clear waters,"An absolutely beautiful beach and although fairly small there is always a spot you can find. The water was so incredibly clear you can see right through, would definitely recommend spending the day there as there is a beach bar just across the road for some food and a shop to grab some snacks.",July 2018,Megas Gialos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g6212263-d11445413-Reviews-Megas_Gialos_Beach-Megas_Gialos_Syros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Syros, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worth the visit,"It’s not a bad little church, we aren’t religious and so we only go for the tourist value but it was fairly nice. It was very hot outside when we went so was nice to cool off a bit inside. If you’re wandering around the city it’s worth popping in.",July 2018,Saint Nicholas Church,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616163-d8020458-Reviews-Saint_Nicholas_Church-Hermoupolis_Syros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Syros, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Wish there was more,"A great sight to see if your in Paros and some great history to it! This being said I wish there was something more to the sight, the pictures are all it really is.",July 2018,Frankish Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g642171-d12828303-Reviews-Frankish_Castle-Parikia_Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0

Fantastic breakfast,"Came her for breakfast on our last day in Paros and what a good choice it was! I had the Aegean Omelette and it was delicious, my girlfriend had the chocolate pancakes and they where to die for! Although it is a bit pricey I would recommend! And if you get there at happy hour they are the cheapest cocktails on the front!",July 2018,Hotel Paros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g642171-d1027141-Reviews-Hotel_Paros-Parikia_Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
