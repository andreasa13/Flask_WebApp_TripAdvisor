Great for Vegetarian Diners,I visited here recently - I'm not a vegetarian however many of my vegetarian friends adore this restaurant. I think for the type of dining this restaurant is clearly above and beyond. Some of the dishes were very good - some I found to be good (but not mind-blowing for this non-vegetarian). Unfortunately due to time issues with the seatings - we were hurried out the door despite having a set menu with matching wines. While I understand the issues with COVID - it was a bit of a dampener on the evening - plus we would have stayed for coffees and dessert wine! Overall though - I'm glad I tried it - I'm definitely a carnivore though!,November 2020,Yellow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d5491295-Reviews-Yellow-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Fantastic Sri Lankan Food,This restaurant has been around a while and always gets really good reviews - have wanted to visit for a while now. A few of the reviews here comment on the poor service - however this wasn't my experience on a busy weekend. Found the service to be efficient and friendly - so they may have new staff - or newer staff who are now more experienced than before. The food itself is fantastic - the set menu is the perfect amount of food - some interesting drink choices - and the sambal platter component of the set menu is something I haven't had before in Sydney. Nice cozy venue - definitely book ahead.,November 2020,Lankan Filling Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d15003116-Reviews-Lankan_Filling_Station-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Bottomless Brunch,"First experience at this restaurant and also the ""bottomless brunch"" concept. The food was great - more modern Mexican style than Tex Mex - which is a great refreshing change. The venue is small and offers outdoor seating as well - which is nice in the warmer weather. The value for the brunch is good - they were very generous with the beverage service - and the food was well paced. You get to try all the tacos on the menu and then you can order more as you need it. It's only a small venue so definitely book ahead. The brunch on Sunday was pretty much fully booked for the morning and afternoon seatings.",November 2020,Sonora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d19649271-Reviews-Sonora-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Such an interesting concept,Peruvian Japanese inspired dining? Definitely don't get that every day. Visited here recently and had the tasting menu with paired wines. Absolutely loved everything we were served and the wine pairing was great (they do offer it but didn't see in on the menu - just ask). The service was efficient and friendly - very informative with the meals/ingredients and the wines. Interesting range of cocktails that you also don't see just anywhere. Nice atmosphere. Definitely recommend for something different. I got more of a Peruvian vibe than a Japanese vibe - but that was fine with me considering I wanted something different.,November 2020,Nikkei Bar & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d19585143-Reviews-Nikkei_Bar_Restaurant-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Special Occasion Option in Dubbo,I had dinner here one night when visiting the area. The venue itself is very nice and had more of an upmarket feel to it. The food is good quality - and the waitstaff were pleasant (and quite hard working given the place was so busy). The only issue we experienced was a very long wait between courses - entree to main took literally just over an hour. Apart from that - good experience. Definitely book ahead as this venue gets completely booked out.,October 2020,Veldt Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255320-d8089153-Reviews-Veldt_Restaurant-Dubbo_New_South_Wales.html,"Dubbo, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Quirky Local Place - Packed and the Place to Be!,This really is the place to be in Bourke - whenever I walked past it was busy - and when I had dinner there on Friday night - people were being turned away due to no tables. The food itself is reasonably priced and the menu has a fair bit of variety. Full bar and drinks. We were likely some of the very few out of towners dining there - so it is nice to see the Bourke local community out and about - given that during summer the heat keeps people indoors. Would give this place top points for atmosphere and life! Apparently VERY popular weekend breakfast venue - perhaps book ahead.,October 2020,Diggers on the Darling,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g528927-d3398272-Reviews-Diggers_on_the_Darling-Bourke_New_South_Wales.html,"Bourke, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Fantastic Stay,I really enjoyed staying at this property. The owners are friendly and each of the rooms are unique. The property itself is nicely maintained and I enjoyed having some drinks in the vast outdoor areas in the afternoon. The property is a short walk from two of the three main dining options in town. The property is secure and safe in terms of parking and during your stay overnight - gates are locked in the evenings until morning. Good amount of parking available for those staying.,October 2020,Bourke Riverside Motel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g528927-d631276-Reviews-Bourke_Riverside_Motel-Bourke_New_South_Wales.html,"Bourke, Australia",hotels,5.0,4.0
An excellent choice for something,An excellent choice for something a bit different. I had the nasi goreng which I haven’t had in years and wasn’t disappointed. Fresh food - good portions at reasonable prices. Delicious.,August 2020,Medan Ciak,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d10836658-Reviews-Medan_Ciak-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good Afternoon Drink Venue,Good wine for an early afternoon drink. Service was efficient and friendly. Insanely huge selection of rum on the menu from all over the world. Good selection of other choices if you aren’t keen on rum too - but recommend giving it a go since rum is their specialty!,August 2020,Brix Distillers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d15136649-Reviews-Brix_Distillers-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great Variety of Fried Chicken,"Quite enjoyed some take away on the COVID19 environment. We ordered the ""Rainbow Platter"" which is a huge amount of food and a great deal of variety amongst the multitude of fried chicken ""flavours"" they offer at this venue. The food was flavoursome and exactly what you expect when ordering Korean fried chicken.",May 2020,Chicken V,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d13171041-Reviews-Chicken_V-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,3.5
High Quality Take Home and Prepare,"I recently picked up a DIY COVID19 dinner from the boys at Claires Kitchen. Everything was fantastic and even though I am not much of a DIY type - this was all very simple to prepare - for the most part you just had to put it on a plate and serve it. The food itself was fantastic and the presentation and packaging for a pick up and take home three course meal was lovely.

For anyone who is a bit unsure of how fine dining or more upmarket food copes in the COVID take home environment - don't let that put you off with this venue. While of course it would have been great to have had the meal in their lovely venue - the food itself was just as good on my dining room table for a family birthday dinner!",May 2020,Claires kitchen at le Salon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d3190882-Reviews-Claires_kitchen_at_le_Salon-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Delicious,What isn't to like about donuts smothered in absolutely any mix of sauces and flavours you could possibly want? The serving sizes are just about right given the sugar content. Even as someone who isn't normally a dessert person - this was very good and would recommend giving it a go.,May 2020,Lukumades,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d20068184-Reviews-Lukumades-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Awesome!,It's great that we now have a Filipino restaurant in the city area and don't have to travel way out of the CBD to get it! (I will travel out to the burbs to get good Filo food). Such a nice little venue. Fantastic service. We went on the all you can eat night - which is essentially 2 x platter sets bought to your table and then you can order those same items again in whatever quantity and combination you want. Great value and a varied number of items available. They have a full menu available on the other nights which also looks really good. Highly recommend this if you want to try an Asian cuisine which isn't as abundant in the Sydney city area.,February 2020,Rey's Place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d13326381-Reviews-Rey_s_Place-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Such A Great Find,There's something really fantastic about this little restaurant tucked away in a street off Bourke. The venue is small and the tables are mostly communal - so get ready for the love thy neighbour type feel. The food was really good and the selection on the menu is varied with some interesting finds. The service was good and our waitperson happily explained the items on the menu that we weren't familiar with. This restaurant recently got some very great reviews on social media - which is another reason I flagged it to try - wasn't disappointed. A fantastic and way better alternative to the Korean restaurants in the CBD.,February 2020,Sáng by Mabasa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d15361085-Reviews-Sang_by_Mabasa-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great Food in Casual Relaxed Venue,Visited here recently as it is close to my work place and I have been wanting to try it for a long time. The service was great. The venue is casual and relaxed. The menu is extensive and for those who haven't had Persian food before - or have limited experience with Persian food - I would say this is a good option due to the many choices on the menu. Everything we had was truly unique and not like anything I had tried before. Reasonably priced as well. They do bargain priced lunch specials if you are fond of kebab meats and rice. Will definitely go back.,February 2020,Din Din Persian Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d12255469-Reviews-Din_Din_Persian_Kitchen-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Summer Rooftop Venue with Very Young Crowd,I have been meaning to visit here for a while and finally got around to it now that summer has truly hit us. The venue itself is nice - it's fairly small and can feel a tad crowded when busy. The service was good. The view from the top is good - although keep in mind you aren't that high up and I don't think this venue has been penned as a city view from the roof establishment anyways. The cocktail menu is inventive and the presentation of the drinks was very unique. The seating next to the DJ speakers which are scattered around the outer walls can get painfully loud (not just loud but truly painfully) and I noticed most of the venue was made up of a VERY young crowd. Not that I have anything against people in their early 20s or that they were doing anything to ruin anyone's experience of the venue! Another good thing about this venue is that there are multiple bars over a number of floors in the building - so easy to switch settings if you like.,February 2020,Slims Rooftop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d16707389-Reviews-Slims_Rooftop-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Mussels and Chips!,"Visited here last week for the very popular $29 mussels and chips night. Okay, I will mention this is ""all you can eat"" now. Essentially all you can eat mussels and french fries $39 without wine (I think) but if you purchase wine it is $29 for the food. Really great experience. The food was great - and also a great wine selection available. The venue is small so bookings are a must. They have different menus on certain nights for promos however the full menu is available every night. I've read a few reviews where people have negatively commented on the service. I would call the service ""relaxed"" which doesn't necessarily mean ""bad"". New staff will learn and I'm sure any hiccups along the way will be taken on board :)",February 2020,Loluk Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d12166283-Reviews-Loluk_Bistro-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great Modern Mexican Alternative,My friends love this place so I visited with them last weekend. This is a great option for people who want Mexican food without the usual Tex-Mex cheese and carbs - however you can gets some of this too if you really want it! This is more of a modern Mexican restaurant - with some great options on the menu that you won't get in the same way you would get the item served in a traditional Mexican restaurant - for example - the tacos are miniature flour tortillas which you wrap the contents and eat in a few bites vs. the huge cheesy traditional taco. Good venue - relaxed. Good wine and drinks options.,January 2020,Chula,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d13313768-Reviews-Chula-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Fantastic Small Bar,I would highly recommend this small bar which is over in Stanley Street - a short walk from Hyde Park/Oxford Street. The bar is tucked away upstairs and is a fun intimate venue with great service and atmosphere. The best part is the cocktails - no menu - the staff can make you any of the traditional cocktails but they have a range of home made liqueurs that you don't find in just any bar. You can choose a flavour - and an alcohol base and they will create you something amazing. I had three different cocktails and all of them were fantastic. Chipotle margaritas? Beetroot negroni? Bubblegum spritz? It's all here.,January 2020,The Long Goodbye,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d12794913-Reviews-The_Long_Goodbye-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Fantastic!,I had been recommended this restaurant and had lunch with a friend here last weekend. I really enjoyed the friendly service and the variety of specials that were available. The three course menu is excellent value. The range of wines was fantastic and the wine recommendations were spot on for what I was wanting. The food was excellent and presentation was perfect. Try to keep this restaurant in mind next time you are looking for a venue outside of the typical CBD or Surry Hills locale.,January 2020,Bistro St Jacques,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d3392897-Reviews-Bistro_St_Jacques-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Chilli Margaritas,"Really enjoyed this venue. Fantastic selection on the menu. Great drinks and selection of margarita flavours. The serves are pretty huge so take your appetite. The service was also really good - the staff are fantastic. Nice atmosphere - relaxed - good for families, friends and casual meals. Nice spot just across from the brewery as well.",January 2020,Cactus Jack's Bar & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255073-d722877-Reviews-Cactus_Jack_s_Bar_Grill-Townsville_Queensland.html,"Townsville, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great Venue for Beer in Summer,So glad I stumbled across this fantastic little brewery just over from the main CBD drag in Townsville. The venue is great - nice and relaxed - great staff - DJ some evenings and an interesting beer selection. Outdoor seating also makes this a really great summer afternoon beverage venue.,December 2019,Tiny Mountain Brewery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255073-d19620019-Reviews-Tiny_Mountain_Brewery-Townsville_Queensland.html,"Townsville, Australia",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great Stay Great Location,Highly recommend this hotel if you want a great location where you can walk pretty much anywhere in the local CBD area. The hotel is comfortable - reasonably priced and the staff are fantastic. The views from the rooftop pool area of Castle Hill are fantastic.,December 2019,Hotel Grand Chancellor Townsville,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255073-d255393-Reviews-Hotel_Grand_Chancellor_Townsville-Townsville_Queensland.html,"Townsville, Australia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Fantastic Stay,Recently booked a room here and loved everything about the experience. The staff are wonderful. The rooms are beautifully designed and contemporary. Bar and cafe onsite and in a fantastic location in Surry Hills.

Fun Half Day Trip,Enjoyed this half day trip which we did independently from Port Vila. You can catch a local bus from town to the falls for around 150vt per person. The entry for adults is a rather pricey 2000vt however told this is due to foreign investors buying the land and setting the entry fee. Try to have correct change. The walk isn’t too challenging for those used to outdoor walking or hiking - however there are three ankle deep water crossings so your shoes will get wet. A number of spots along the trail where you can stop and swim. Restaurant and bar also onsite. The waterfall itself is quite charming right at the top.,September 2019,Mele Cascades,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294144-d657929-Reviews-Mele_Cascades-Port_Vila_Efate.html,"Efate, Vanuatu",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great Stay,Would highly recommend if you want something conveniently located to Port Vila without technically being in it. A short ferry ride - 3 minutes - from the wharf. The resort grounds are pristine. The fares are comfortable. The staff are great. The food is also good compared to other meals we had in town. Happy hours at the bar. Snorkling spot on island. Nice pool. Tours desk. Pretty much everything you need to relax without having to trek too far on a short stay.,September 2019,Iririki Island Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294144-d311955-Reviews-Iririki_Island_Resort_Spa-Port_Vila_Efate.html,"Efate, Vanuatu",hotels,4.0,4.5
Deserves The Current #1 Ranking,"By far the best (and expensive) meal we had while in Port Vila - but worth paying a bit extra in terms of the venue, service and food. Dining out in PV is expensive everywhere and this isn’t too much more than standard depending what you do. Nice atmosphere - good seafood options - best fish I had during my week stay.",September 2019,The Blue Marlin Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294144-d12718769-Reviews-The_Blue_Marlin_Club-Port_Vila_Efate.html,"Efate, Vanuatu",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good Casual Venue,Recommend this venue for a casual and relatively inexpensive (for Port Vila) option. Good beer selection - daily specials - food was good and what would be expected of this venue and price point - and if it appeals you can watch sport - as it is essentially a sports bar with televised events on the various screens. The pizza specials for 1000vt seemed very popular and they also use a proper wood fire oven - so none of these frozen base type things you see served up around the place.,September 2019,The Brewery Bar & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294144-d1580869-Reviews-The_Brewery_Bar_Restaurant-Port_Vila_Efate.html,"Efate, Vanuatu",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Nice Venue - Average Seafood,"Visited here recently and will do a summary of the good and the not so good:

Good service
Great venue
Nice outdoor seating right on the water
Decent menu variety
Good drink selection

Expensive for what it is - although eating out here is expensive across the board
The seafood items were average - I would recommend the beef options as they were much better.",September 2019,The Waterfront Bar and Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294144-d1816855-Reviews-The_Waterfront_Bar_and_Grill-Port_Vila_Efate.html,"Efate, Vanuatu",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Decent Food But Dont Understand The Hype,Been meaning to try this place for a while. It always seems really busy and a few of my friends really rate it. The menu is extensive and the service is super efficient and fast. The food itself is decent but I wouldn’t say it is spectacular.

Enjoyable,A really pleasant restaurant. Good service. Reasonable prices and good variety on the menu. The octopus was great. The tagliatelle special was also delicious. The vibe is more an upmarket special occasion restaurant with upper mid range prices. A good choice along the Kensington St strip.,July 2019,Olio Kensington Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d12094326-Reviews-Olio_Kensington_Street-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Wine Heaven,I actually like this whole block - the hotel - the cafe - the cinema - so figured I would also like Poly. The wine list is amazing with some great choices - something for everyone and some very good quality wines. The atmosphere is great - gets busy - the service is also very good and friendly and the staff are knowledgeable about what they serve. The food menu also looks great but haven't yet eaten here.,June 2019,Poly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d15109985-Reviews-Poly-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Decent - But Not Amazing,I tried this place recently - I have had this particular cuisine before in Sydney but hadn't visited this restaurant before. While I enjoyed the unique nature of the food - definitely different - I thought the food was on the overpriced side for what it was - including the serve sizes. The menu prices reflect a way more upmarket establishment than the very casual eatery that it is. Possibly the prices are due to the novelty. Having said that - it was pretty busy. You can find other restaurants in Sydney serving this cuisine but at cheaper eatery prices with just as good food.,June 2019,Kiroran Silkwood Road Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d4774843-Reviews-Kiroran_Silkwood_Road_Restaurant-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Interesting Menu,I have been wanting to try this place for a while but never tend to eat in this part of the city. My friend really likes it so we visited before seeing a film. It gets really busy - we had to wait in a line for a table even really early at 6.30pm on a weekday. It was packed. The food itself is very good and it's not too expensive. The best thing about this place is the menu - which is definitely a different take on Chinese cuisine. I could have easily chosen several items which I had never seen on a menu before. A good choice if in the area.,June 2019,Chefs Gallery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d2091963-Reviews-Chefs_Gallery-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Pros and Cons,"I stayed here recently at the end of a trip to China. I have stayed at a number of Banyan Tree properties and this was the fourth property I had visited. There are a number of pros and cons in relation to this particular Banyan Tree - especially when compared to the other ones I had stayed in before.

Pros:
The staff are trying really hard - despite the service for Western tourists not being on par with the other Banyan Tree properties
The villas are lovely. Spacious, well kept.
The grounds are kept very well.
The restaurant serves really fantastic food - despite it not having a particularly upmarket feel to it - we almost didn't go but were very glad we did.

Cons:
English was sometimes a challenge - it is clear that this particular Banyan Tree property caters to the Chinese tourist market and this is reflected in the service and overall experience at the property.
The location is somewhat odd - it is in a discount warehouse outlet shop plaza and then backs onto wetlands - which we didn't visit. It is also a bit out of the way - and not near the lovely Westlake area. Although a taxi only takes about fifteen minutes to Westlake.
The little touches you get at Banyan Tree were somewhat missing - again I think this is because it is more geared to Chinese tourists.
It is actually quite expensive - comparable to the villa Banyan Tree accommodation elsewhere but nowhere near the experience of elsewhere.",May 2019,Banyan Tree Hangzhou,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298559-d1507745-Reviews-Banyan_Tree_Hangzhou-Hangzhou_Zhejiang.html,"Hangzhou, China",hotels,4.0,5.0
Another Fantastic Banyan Tree Property,Highly recommend staying here if you want to be slightly away from the hectic area of The Bund. The staff are fantastic and the property is stunning. Great breakfasts. Even the standard rooms here are amazing - so comfortable and beautifully designed. The rooftop bar has an amazing city view and it would be worthwhile coming here for a drink just to see it!,June 2019,Banyan Tree Shanghai On The Bund,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g308272-d3483610-Reviews-Banyan_Tree_Shanghai_On_The_Bund-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",hotels,5.0,5.0
Great!,We wanted to try a more local establishment and this was close to the hotel so gave it a try. Highly recommended. This is a local restaurant and we were somewhat a nicely being western tourists. The staff are helpful and there is a picture menu in English with prices so there isn’t a problem ordering exactly what you want to eat. Cash only venue but local prices - probably a bit more for English speakers but still ridiculously inexpensive. Everything we ordered was fantastic.,June 2019,Fang Ting Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g308272-d4449179-Reviews-Fang_Ting_Restaurant-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great - If You Like Chinese Art,A very impressive building with an even more impressive and huge collection of Chinese art. Conveniently accessed by metro line. Free entry. The artworks seemed endless and I didn’t see everything despite spending a few hours there. Much better than the Shanghai museum in my opinion.,June 2019,China Art Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g308272-d5114484-Reviews-China_Art_Museum-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",attractions,3.0,4.0
Quirky Photo Op,I visited here because I’m a bit of an architectural photography nerd and it wasn’t too far from my hotel. There are a few interesting photo ops of the interior and the central staircases. Were a fair few people with cameras taking some photos within the building. The shops that now take up the space aren’t anything special. I wouldn’t say this is a tourist attraction per se - but rather a quirky and casual stop to see a brutalist concrete monstrosity in the modern day. I enjoyed it.,June 2019,1933 Old Millfun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g308272-d1438183-Reviews-1933_Old_Millfun-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great Choice,Visited here while in Shanghai after reading several great reviews. The menu is unique being from a specific region near the Myanmar border - with many items I had never tried before. We really enjoyed everything we ordered. The service was attentive and efficient. The restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere and is HUGE. They take online bookings which I would recommend doing as it gets pretty busy even on weekends since it is located in the busy Bund area.,June 2019,Lost Heaven on the Bund,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g308272-d2293276-Reviews-Lost_Heaven_on_the_Bund-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Quality Korean Fried Chicken,This place came highly recommended and didn’t disappoint. A number of fried chicken options with a variety of other options for the less inclined.

Great Stay,Really liked this hotel. Great location. Nice rooms and amenities. Efficient and helpful staff. Located nearby a ton of shopping complexes and eat streets. Metro nearby too for efficient and cheap transport all over town.

Interesting Sightseeing Stop,The gate itself is impressive and the grounds are well with the entrance fee. The most interesting quirk were the dozens of girls who bring along traditional outfits to photograph each other with their friends and take selfies. Even the tourists get into it and there’s a costume hire place conveniently located near by. Had a lot of fun here simply people watching.,May 2019,Gyeongbokgung Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294197-d324888-Reviews-Gyeongbokgung_Palace-Seoul.html,"Seoul, South Korea",attractions,4.0,4.5
Wonderful Stay,Stayed here for three nights recently and enjoyed my stay. Chose this particular hotel due to location and wasn’t disappointed. Check in was effortless. As a diamond member I got upgraded to a corner suite - which was beautiful. The executive lounge was wonderful with the various food and wine services throughout the day. Helpful concierge and was impressed by the English language skills of the staff.,May 2019,Hilton Beijing Wangfujing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294212-d1146087-Reviews-Hilton_Beijing_Wangfujing-Beijing.html,"Beijing, China",hotels,5.0,4.5
Food with a Kick,I’m not scared of spicy food and deal with it quite well - but usually as a Westerner I’m served mildly spicy foods when abroad. Not here. These guys mean business. A little local place - not overly frequented by tourists - we were somewhat a novelty while dining. The younger staff were sent over to serve us - limited English but we got by. Menus in English were available. This is the real deal if you are wanting spice.,May 2019,Chuan Ban Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294212-d940306-Reviews-Chuan_Ban_Restaurant-Beijing.html,"Beijing, China",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Amazing!,I haven’t been doing upmarket evening meals while in China - but this place was highly recommended and we gave it a try. This place is worth visiting for the menu alone - there are literally 100s of items to choose from. The food was fantastic - beautifully presented. Service was also very good. Menus in English are available and the staff speak English very well. Great wine list. This is a must.,May 2019,BeiJing Dadong Roast Duck (JinBao Hui),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294212-d1541503-Reviews-BeiJing_Dadong_Roast_Duck_JinBao_Hui-Beijing.html,"Beijing, China",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Huge Temple Complex,Visited here recently as this is a must see for visitors to Beijing. The complex is huge - a fair bit of variety in terms of sights within the gates. The place gets busy so expect crowds. Tickets can be purchased online in advance - as they only allow a set number of visitors per day. The ticket staff at the gates were highly efficient and although it was busy - entry was swift. Foreigners need to take their passports which are scanned to validate the ticket purchased online.,May 2019,Forbidden City-The Palace Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294212-d319086-Reviews-Forbidden_City_The_Palace_Museum-Beijing.html,"Beijing, China",attractions,4.0,4.5
Casual Dining,I’ve read a few reviews ripping on this place but not sure why. Maybe it’s the expectations prior to visiting? This is a low key casual eatery - good prices - the dumplings were decent - I would even say they were really good - keeping in mind the price and the type of eatery this is! Staff were able to deal with us - being English speaking tourists - and I thoroughly enjoyed.,May 2019,Three Sisters Dumplings (East Mutoushi),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298557-d8482134-Reviews-Three_Sisters_Dumplings_East_Mutoushi-Xi_an_Shaanxi.html,"Xi'an, China",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Excellent City Activity,This is a really nice way to see the city at a slight elevation. You can walk various sections of it and exit without having to do a full circuit. You can also cycle around it with a bike for a quicker experience. You can purchase a combination ticket for the wall and museum with the steles if you want to see both.,May 2019,Xi'an City Wall (Chengqiang),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298557-d459901-Reviews-Xi_an_City_Wall_Chengqiang-Xi_an_Shaanxi.html,"Xi'an, China",attractions,4.0,4.5
Big Ticket Item for Xian,As a tourist visiting Xi’an this is likely what you want to see - and possibly also why you are visiting Xi’an in the first place. Enjoyed my visit - which I did by day trip guided tour because the journey out seemed a bit complicated. It’s about 2 hours out of Xi’an. The number of warriors here is impressive and great to see all of the tourism dollars going into care and restoration.,May 2019,The Museum of Qin Terra-cotta Warriors and Horses,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298557-d321017-Reviews-The_Museum_of_Qin_Terra_cotta_Warriors_and_Horses-Xi_an_Shaanxi.html,"Xi'an, China",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great Stay,This is a very reasonably priced Hilton hotel in a great location. As a diamond member I got an upgrade to a room bigger than my actual apartment back home. Staff are friendly and try very hard to accommodate - English skills are quite good with most staff. The executive lounge is also really nice and the staff there are efficient with check in and check out. Breakfast buffet is also very good.,May 2019,Hilton Xi'an,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298557-d2194498-Reviews-Hilton_Xi_an-Xi_an_Shaanxi.html,"Xi'an, China",hotels,5.0,4.5
Fantastic!,If you want some local food with plenty of choice - low prices and fantastic quality - highly recommend you visit. The best food I’ve had in China at the halfway point of a three week trip. They have a Western menu which makes it easy enough for those who don’t speak Mandarin. English amongst the staff is very limited but they try so hard to accommodate and figure it out! Loved this place.,May 2019,RenRen Ju (Ju Huayuan),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298557-d3496064-Reviews-RenRen_Ju_Ju_Huayuan-Xi_an_Shaanxi.html,"Xi'an, China",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Something Different,Tried this restaurant recently for something totally different. Wasn’t disappointed! The staff are fantastic. The food is hearty and delicious. Really enjoyed everything we ordered. Fantastic bar staff and cocktails like nothing I’d seen before. The lamb chump and pork belly are a must. Note the address because it isn’t overly sign posted on the street.,May 2019,Mjølner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d12493034-Reviews-Mjolner-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Pleasant Weekend Lunch,Visited here after reading many positive reviews. A very small and cozy venue with a set menu that frequently changes. The food was interesting with great flavour combinations. The service was also very good. They don’t have tea or coffee on the menu - which I found unusual. Wine menu features mostly Australian wines - if you fancy local or Aussie produce.,May 2019,Arthur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d15279010-Reviews-Arthur-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Best Motel 6 Yet,This would be the best Motel 6 I have stayed in over the years. They can be quite variable between properties - however this one is definitely one of the best. The condition of the rooms and buildings - car parking facilities - front desk - all on the upper end of what you can expect from this price point. Decent location as well to different food options. Staff were also fantastic here. I would recommend this particular property if considering a Motel 6 price point and stay.,July 2017,Badlands Inn & Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g49761-d10445611-Reviews-Badlands_Inn_Suites-Dickinson_North_Dakota.html,"Dickinson, North Dakota",hotels,4.0,3.5
Awesome Fried Chicken,Decided to try this place for something different and wasn’t disappointed! The fried chicken is fantastic - and the burgers are delicious. Good range of sides. Big servings. A great choice for something different other than the usual fried chicken places. Highly recommended.,May 2019,Thirsty Bird,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d11772735-Reviews-Thirsty_Bird-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great Burgers,So many burger places around at the moment - but this one stacks up well. Decent sized servings and quality for the price point - with some good variety on the menu.,May 2019,Burgers Anonymous,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d10507558-Reviews-Burgers_Anonymous-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great Modern Asian Cuisine,I would recommend visiting if you want to try some modern Asian cuisine - quite inventive with a range of flavours and dishes that you don’t see all that often. The Chef Selection - 10 courses - is excellent value and a ton of food - you won’t leave hungry. Pleasant atmosphere. Good friendly and efficient service.,April 2019,Madame Shanghai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d12720496-Reviews-Madame_Shanghai-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great Spanish Food,Visited here on the weekend with friends from out of town who specifically requested tapas. Had always heard good things about Bodega and decided to give it a try. We had the chef menu which gets you a variety of the dishes on the menu. We truly loved everything we were served. The hostess was fantastic and the service was quick - even with a fully booked restaurant. Very impressed.,April 2019,Bodega Tapas Restaurant and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d737783-Reviews-Bodega_Tapas_Restaurant_and_Bar-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
