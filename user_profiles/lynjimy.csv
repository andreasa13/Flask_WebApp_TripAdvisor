Outstanding!,"This was an amazing tour given by Ivo R-it was a pleasure to listen to his description of Dubrovnik and his story with GoT. The in-depth information provided with every backdrop on different parts of the tour were fascinating - even for those within our group with were not au fait with GoT! This is such a beautiful city and every corner turns into another wonderful visual display of the amazing architecture. Ivo made the whole tour come alive-he was just so informative.Ivo confirmed our tour the day before and where he would be, the driver was very friendly and helpful too. Excellent! Would highly recommend toursByLocals if you are wanting a very informative and friendly tour of this beautiful city.",October 2019,Dubrovnik - ToursByLocals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295371-d8078861-Reviews-Dubrovnik_ToursByLocals-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Would not trust them!,"We booked the fun tour for Mykonos and whilst on the cruise they cancelled with no explanation. Apparently the email was incorrect?! The only thing I can recommend is that the did refund the money paid.
It was frustrating to be left without a tour and with no way of organising anything else other than a cruise tour which we did not want.
anyway, would say Mykonos was so easy to get around just walking so would not waste money on a tour that can be cancelled last minute!",October 2019,e-TUK Mykonos Fun Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189430-d17428099-E_TUK_Mykonos_Fun_Tour-Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",activities,1.0,3.0
Amazing!,Definitely get there early to avoid the queues and purchase an advance ticket for entry. The walk up and steps are not as horrendous as I had read previously - yes it was tough in parts but not too bad. they are undertaking a big renovation of the whole area so lots of scaffolding and works taking place but this is an ancient monument so you still get the feel for the place. It was just amazing - so pleased that at last I can say I have been to the Acropolis and walked those areas of such history.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Do not look elsewhere!,From the time of booking with several queries to the end of our tour of Athens we could not find fault with Private Greece Tours - an outstanding company! We were met at Piraeus Port by George in an immaculate limo. George is an amazing guide - so very knowledgeable and informative. the whole tour was so fascinating and enhanced by George's knowledge of history. We made the Acropolis before the crowds - as promised - and were one step ahead of most of the cruise ship tours due to George's indepth knowledge of Athens. We were really fortunate to see the changing of the Guards at the President's Palace - just brilliant. Nikos - Private Greece Tour's owner had recommended purchasing a Combined entry ticket prior to our trip - what a great suggestion - you beat the queues and see so many places for a good price! This tour covered a lot for us - and George still offered more. Usually on a tour you are left hanging around waiting for the 'agreed pick up time' - with George he gives you a telephone to call him and he is there within 5 mins to collect you and go on to the next area. We even had time to see the beaches of Athens. This company has to be number one if you are looking to book a tour in Athens - from a cruise ship or not. They have just been outstanding in their service. I have to say we were slightly anxious as no money had changed hands prior to the tour as to whether it would take place but should not have been concerned - I would recommend everyone to use Private Greece tours to get the best service and guides when in Athens.,October 2019,Private Greece Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1924860-Reviews-Private_Greece_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

Rooms are adequate, very clean, air con, small balcony but some have larger terraces, tv and private bathrooms. The painting around the doors is in keeping with Mojacars hanging baskets, lovely.

Stunning!,"Had a very relaxing holiday in one of the water villas and highly recommend the Oblu Select. The island is small and easy to walk around, although as previously mentioned, not all soft sand in places. All the villas are well screened and private and having a deck with sun beds & steps leading down to the reef for snorkelling was a real plus. Loved watching the sunrise and all sorts of fish - including sharks and sting rays seem to swim around a lot at that time. Loved the variety of fish we could watch without even getting wet but once you start to snorkel it's difficult to stop - like watching a film show with so many different colours and types of fish along the reef - loved it! The current was very strong at our time of year so you had to pick times for snorkelling - lots wore life jackets but we didn't find these comfortable for swimming. The adult pool area was very pleasant and whenever we went we could get a bed with umbrella. Downside here was the pool - great once you are in but the steps are quite steep and the topstep made you feel that you are going to slip in, although never happened to us or anyone else we saw, just made us all cautious. Great place for drinks at sunset too. Went to the rock bar for a sunset and that was very pleasant but a smaller area with more people, same views. Loved how the courtyard is split into 5 different dining areas, gave you the feeling of being in a more select restaurant. The buffet had a good selection at all times and the staff were really friendly and helpful. The Grill was a superb restaurant- loved the steak here and service outstanding - so much so we decided to pay on our last night for another excellent meal. The Simply Veg was very good the second time we visited but hit and miss the first, although the service was very good. We used the dive centre for a swimming with the turtles trip which was very well organised and great fun. Absolutely loved seeing the turtles and other fish. Really helpful, friendly staff at the centre. Did the sunset fishing - mostly enjoyed that but not how long some people took to take pictures so that they had to throw a couple of dead fish back and we arrived back before the sunset! The Serenity package worked well and we were able to get everything we wanted. Sangs bar is very pleasant place to spend an evening after dinner. Things that need looking at would be the jetty from the reception to the island - not a pretty site and quite dirty looking water at times but not sure how you can hide pipes etc. Reception staff did not follow up on a few requests which was frustrating. They just wrote your room number down but not what you had requested so guess it was forgotten. We asked about a dinner which was advertised on the 'next day'' programme and told - there was no charge for it but it was fully booked - asked to go on waiting list then told it was cancelled due to not enough couples and the cost was $300 per couple! Confusing! The boat transfer could do with more air..very stifling and diesel smelling. Anyway these little things did not detract from what was a wonderful holiday we would go back. Loved the island, rooms and all the staff - too many to mention individually. The beds were so comfy - best ever in a hotel! Rooms provided tea/coffee, plenty of water, mini bar refreshed every day, rain jackets, umbrellas, dressing gowns, slippers, toiletries, torch and a beach bag. Water villas looking out to sea - absolute bliss!

Great find!,"Read reviews on trip advisor so decided to try it out with friends. very welcoming, staff really helpful & friendly. Although the restaurant is on the small size it delivers fantastic tasty food. A really impressive menu with choices for everyone. Would say that the size of the starters two could share easily as the main meals are large too. Most come with a salad which was lovely and fresh. Really interesting flavours. Meat cooked to perfection. We were all too full to try a dessert but they had a good choice. Very busy for a week night too which must be a good sign.

Not to be missed!,"Decided to take advantage of the Steak Night deal at Mariposa and it was excellent! Love the quirky rooms here and they are very well equipped with tea & coffee, fridge, safe, plenty of pillows and extra blankets available. We stayed in the Hat Room on the ground floor. Very well heated and quiet. When we arrived we were made very welcome by Tom and family and they looked after us exceptionally well. The food was lovely and the steaks were all cooked to the individuals request. Cozy in the restaurant with log fire too. Would recommend taking advantage of this and the other offers at the Mariposa. It's a great location in the mountains and the activities supplied are very good.

Lovely!,Went here for a late dinner. Jaime the waiter was very attentive and extremely helpful with menu choices. Food is beautifully presented. Two of us had scallops and although they were a tad overlooked they were enjoyable. The plate of salmon was a real hit. The steaks were cooked to perfection and just as requested. Good choice of wines available and very nice desserts. Glad we managed to find this restaurant and although we booked they were not too busy. Have to say chatting with Jaime and the lady waitress made the visit more enjoyable.

Great hotel,"Hotel is spotlessly clean, easy to find and quite a good location. Rooms were very spacious with amenities in the bathrooms and a hairdryer. Air con worked really well, beds were comfy. Staff were very helpful and it was quick to check in/out. Beautiful aroma as you enter the hotel! Parking is great value but it is tight getting around the lower floors if you have a large car, a few pillars in the area too. Great wifi and mineral water supplied free of charge. Could possibly improve with tea/coffee facilities in the room but Spanish hotels in general do not supply this. Safety deposit box in room free of charge.",July 2018,Eurostars Centrum Alicante,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1064230-d483592-Reviews-Eurostars_Centrum_Alicante-Alicante_Costa_Blanca_Province_of_Alicante_Valencian_Countr.html,"Alicante, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.0

Staff are very friendly, helpful and welcoming. The menu has a really varied and great selection to suit most people. The food was very well presented and delicious! I had the scallop starter and steak tartar as a main and it was exquisite. The other diners had different dishes and all said their food was wonderful and very well presented. Would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant if you are in Cartagena.

Excellent,Stayed at this hotel for a second time and we were not disappointed. Although the room we had was smaller the bathroom had been refurbished and it was lovely and quiet. The staff on the front desk are exceptionally helpful and the housekeeping are excellent with their cleanliness always smiling. The car park is a real bonus and very reasonably priced for an overnight stay. Breakfast was plentiful but a little wait for hot food to be replenished which was the only down side.

Great find!,"Four of us went to this restaurant and had the Menu Largo - what an experience. It was like walking back into a very old Spanish home, beautiful rooms with a very pretty courtyard. We sat in one of the smaller rooms which was very pleasant. The food was superb and every course was beautifully displayed. We experienced so many different flavours. We were very well looked after and the only criticism would be that the dishes arrived very quickly so we did ask for a slower service which suited us. Good wine list to choose from as well. We thought for around 30 euros a head this restaurant was excellent value and well worth it.

We had a small balcony at the front of the hotel and you can sit easily watching the world go by. Breakfast typically Spanish with toasted baguette, cold meats cheese, jams, fruit and extremely plentiful.

enjoyable!,"We were fortunate to be on the Preferred Club basis at the hotel and the little extras do enhance the stay. We had a personalised check in with Melissa and Denissa who explained everything. The club members have a separate lounge/bar area (where Cesar and Eric look after you very well), breakfast and lunch in the Seaside Grill and ability to book a cabana on the grass area or beach. The rooms are very spread out and our room was up quite a steep hill which could have more lighting but certainly helped with some exercise after the wonderful food. It would not be suitable for people who have any walking problems. Mention has been made in previous reviews of the shuttles but they never passed our room as it was on a dead end so you had to phone each time or have a long wait at busy times. The suite was spacious, very clean and comfortable with wonderful views and had tea/coffee, Internet etc. The restaurants are very good quality with enough choice for a two week stay. The staff all go out of their way to be extremely helpful, Henry who seemed to pop up everywhere was a great character, Nelly, Kenneth and Carlos at seaside especially helpful. We were lucky to be able to book a cabana so never had a problem with sunbeds, but on the days we used the pool area we always managed to find beds. The pool area could get noisy and the music is quite loud at times but that seemed to suit a lot of guests. The wines and drinks in the all inclusive packages were very good. There were quite a few functions on during our stay and it did cause some waiting times at dinner in the evenings but the staff work hard to make the delays as limited as possible. The spa area is very nice but when we went we found it noisier than the cabana area. The spa treatments are expensive but we had a Swedish massage which was very good. Overall we liked the hotel due to the location, size, rooms well spread and the staff. Everyone makes you feel very special so what's not to like!",March 2017,Secrets Papagayo Costa Rica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635535-d301221-Reviews-Secrets_Papagayo_Costa_Rica-Gulf_of_Papagayo_Province_of_Guanacaste.html,"Gulf of Papagayo, Costa Rica",hotels,4.0,4.5
Excellent day trip to Nicaragua,"We met Carlos from Alex on the Beach at Secrets and he was extremely helpful - he promised us a special experience in Nicaragua and he didn't disappoint. We were a little worried dealing with people on the beach but should not have given it a second thought. We were picked up and taken to the border stopping for breakfast enroute. Everything was taken care of and all we had to do was produce our passports, we were accompanied the whole way from Costa Rica to Nicaragua. Rodolfo the guide for Nicaragua was excellent, very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. We were biked around Rivas by William, shown the market and a local museum, it was great to see and an unexpected bonus. Then on to Granada which is beautiful. Manual who rode us around in his carriage was very informative and a lovely character and looked after Ramon the horse. It was a lovely place to see so pleased we decided to go. Next on to a boat for a trip around some of the 365 islands and a special stop at monkey island to feed Lucy the spider monkey with avocado! She came onto the boat and tucked in sitting so close it was a great photo opportunity, she was certainly pregnant and enjoyed her lunch. Fantastic experience. We were then taken to masaya volcano where you can look down into the crater and see the lava bubbling - such an amazing site - loved it! Rodolfo took us to lunch which was all cooked on a plancha - delicious. We even had time to walk around a market. On the return journey we went to a volcanic lake (sadly cannot remember the name) and it was beautiful to see. Rodolfo took us back to the border and ensured we got through safely, he would not leave us until we were collected in Costa Rica, really going above and beyond helpful! It's a long day but if you have the opportunity it's certainly one visit you should fit in. We cannot recommend the company highly enough, particularly Rodolfo. We felt so lucky to have the very personal touch and grateful to go through the borders so easily.

Two of us had steak and two fish, one was the lubina cooked in salt which was served and filleted at the table. The food was delicious and enjoyed by us all.
The desert was shared as we were all quite full and the mojito icecream with a winner.

Gavin said there are some changes still to be made, and when this is all done it will add to being a great place to go to have a laugh for groups/families/couples looking to do something different in the Espunas. We had lunch at La Mariposa which was good and then off on the quad bikes. Never having been on a bike before Wayne, our guide, was very patient and explained the machine brilliantly.

Food was glorious and plenty of entertainment if that's your thing.if you can, simply just go and experience this fantastic place!",February 2016,Diamonds Star of the East,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616016-d2157558-Reviews-Diamonds_Star_of_the_East-Nungwi_Zanzibar_Island_Zanzibar_Archipelago.html,"Zanzibar Island, Tanzania",hotels,5.0,4.5
Beautiful location but not so personal,"Loved the rooms but too many people. We prefer a smaller location with a more personal feel about it. The gardens were beautiful. Staff very helpful and friendly. It's fine if you just like buffet food, we like to sit and be spoilt whilst on holiday.",February 2016,"Ngorongoro Farm House, Tanganyika Wilderness Camps",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g317085-d584424-Reviews-Ngorongoro_Farm_House_Tanganyika_Wilderness_Camps-Ngorongoro_Conservation_Area_Arusha_R.html,"Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania",hotels,4.0,4.5

Beautiful,"A great way to spend a night or two, you feel you are in an upmarket tent on the safari. The tents are luxurious and really spacious. John and his staff work really hard to make sure your every wish is catered for and everyone is always smiling and happy. Food was very good with a nice selection on a moving buffet style as they bring all the dishes to you. Breakfast was excellent too. Unfortunately we didn't have an opportunity to try the pool but it looked inviting. They provide torches but as it's an eco lodge the rooms tend to be a little dark. Just try it!",February 2016,Sangaiwe Tented Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608450-d7617233-Reviews-Sangaiwe_Tented_Lodge-Tarangire_National_Park_Arusha_Region.html,"Tarangire National Park, Tanzania",hotels,5.0,4.5

spotless hotel!,"Stayed here for two weeks in March and had a wonderful holiday. The hotel has a beautiful reception area very grandeoise, sparkling chandeliers and marble. The staff are all smiling and exceptionally willing to help with any query/request that you may have. We upgraded to a Jacuzzi suite and loved it, beautiful room with wonderful views of the beach, sea, mountains and everywhere really,it was worth the extra and we were very spoiled. The cleaning staff were so friendly and efficient. Alexis, our minibar sticker, was a real character and we had a good laugh every day with him. The beach was Sandy and clean with plenty of sunbeds on offer, the staff ran around supplying drinks and we could never work out how they remembered whose was what. We had no trouble booking the specialty restaurants at all and used these most nights as we are not buffet lovers and like to eat later. Krystal was excellent, food, staff and ambience. The pool area was very busy and noisy and we don't agree with putting towels out at 4am so forget front line but you could always find a bed or two in the shady area. Drinks were branded and a very good selection. The entertainment team really work hard and the nightly shows were quite entertaining, the Americans seem to love it, you could always get a seat here too and let Paula take care of you. Hopefully covered it all. We absolutely loved the hotel and will return to see Hector on reception and everyone else. Enjoy!",March 2015,Hotel Riu Palace Pacifico,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g9723540-d1097502-Reviews-Hotel_Riu_Palace_Pacifico-Flamingos_Nuevo_Vallarta_Pacific_Coast.html,"Flamingos, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
Fantastic!,"We travelled over with boat #1- Jorge, victor, temo, Ramon, Alex and alonso - what a fantastic crew, they couldn't do enough for you! Wonderful show, costumes, dancing and singing brilliant, you just do not know where to look, so much happening. Buffet food after was good variety and plenty of it. Just arriving on land and seeing all the candles and artists at work takes your breath away. The journey home was spectacular - the Queen tribute act that he crew performed was absolutely brilliant - worth the trip just for that and to see Victor's Freddie Mercury transformation - LOVED IT. They worked so hard to make it a special evening. It's a must visit from us although we did hear some negative comments - people relax, it's not a professional show like the Cirque but it's highly entertaining. Even worth a visit to the toilets!!",March 2015,Rhythms of the Night by Vallarta Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150793-d590382-Reviews-Rhythms_of_the_Night_by_Vallarta_Adventures-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",attractions,5.0,4.5
Yelapa & Pizota,"We travelled on this tour with Hugo & Nellie - great guides and really informative about the places. They even managed to get us to dip into the freezing pool at the waterfall! I was not keen on the horse riding aspect but after a lot of encouragement from Nellie managed the ride and really pleased I did it, thanks Nellie! Pizota was pretty and a good place to relax and eat with Hugo 1 providing the drinks and Hugo 2 the bbq. Lovely!. Had a great day and met some really nice people as it was quite a small tour on the speed boat - wonderful day. There is not a pier at pizota so be prepared to get on/off boats - quite a challenge with the waves but a lot of laughs.",March 2015,Vallarta Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150793-d606429-Reviews-Vallarta_Adventures-Puerto_Vallarta.html,"Puerto Vallarta, Mexico",attractions,4.0,4.5

Wonderful,"Had a wonderful meal in the restaurant, the waiter (who spoke English) was just superb - helped us with the menu and recommended some lovely food. It would have been impossible to choose the food without his help as the menu is completely Spanish with words we had never come across before!
