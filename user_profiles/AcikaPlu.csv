Nice archaeological site,"Nice archaeological site. This temple was twice the size of the Parthenon. Simply when you come you admire how it was build and what it looked like when was new.
I recommend buying tickets here for more sites, as the line is smaller.

Magnificent,You look at the Parthenon and wonder about the story behind it. You canâ€™t not go to Athens without stopping at Parthenon.

Very satisfied,"Location is very good. It is close to Koukunaries beach. But Troulos beach is very good but smaller then Koukunaries. It is 30 meters (100feet) from bus station. Stuff are friendly. Breakfast is not good. Every day it is the same: butter, bread, honey, eggs and jam. Rums are clean but do not expect something special. Hotel is about 150 meters from beach. You have WiFi but don't expect yo be fast.",September 2014,Hotel Korali,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189499-d290755-Reviews-Hotel_Korali-Skiathos_Sporades.html,"Skiathos, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
