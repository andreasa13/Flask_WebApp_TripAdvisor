Eat elsewhere !,"I enjoy good sushi/Japanese restaurants and hoped to add Jensai Sushi to my list of go-to places. Unfortunately, this place was a major disappointment. Both the beef and the chicken were overcooked and tough and the sauce used was no better than what I could buy from the low priced offerings at a grocery store. Perhaps excessive heat ruined the flavor. The beef was worse than the chicken because it was a cheap cut of beef poorly trimmed with gristle and excess fat. The tempura was greasy and the dipping sauce was a salty reminder of something from the low priced shelf at a grocery store. As to the rice included, they must consider this a very costly portion of the meal since they must use a small ice cream scoop as rice portion control. As to the sushi included with each plate, they are small and not as good as what I can buy at Winco when I need a quick sushi fix. The price for all this is much too high and not worth it at half the price. Go elsewhere if you crave sushi/Japanese food. I almost forgot about the service. It matched the quality of the food. Service was without concern to get or earn return business. Just give me your order, give me your credit card and take your food. No smile. It wasn't busy when I was there so there is no excuse for this. I should have known what to expect since having few customers is the best indicator of what I would get. Save your money and support other restaurants. If Jensai Sushi goes out of business, this space can support a much better restaurant in this part of town. Give someone else the opportunity to serve your dining needs.",November 2020,Jensai Sushi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32999-d6405366-Reviews-Jensai_Sushi-Sacramento_California.html,"Sacramento, California",restaurants,1.0,4.0
"Friendly vendors, good prices and fun to people watch","I've been there on the weekend and on a weekday when many vendors are closed and the place has a different vibe but still interesting. The weekend with the crowds is more exciting. It is easy to get to via the Mo Chit BTS Station. This is a big market for the local community and everyone barters so get into the swing but don't be greedy. Food also available and worth trying. You are bound to find something you want.

There were many baby hippos playing with the adults, one even standing on the back of mom in the water! Better than a Disney movie. The boat would stop for a long time so we could fully enjoy the adventure. Ours was the last trip of the day so we enjoyed the sunset with the animals with a beautiful yellow/orange/red glow in the sky reflected on the water as we returned in our slow voyage back to the pier.

It is not Vegas (not close) but it has nice appointments with mostly slot action and a type of roulette bingo (don't ask me, but that had the heaviest and emotional play action going). Machines use a card you preload at the cashier cage for 20 rand refundable fee, then insert in machine of choice and play. I am not a gambler so only wanted an 80 rand limit, but I came out a 51 rand net winner ahead and cashed in. Very short waited to and from casino back to the hotel.

Good leg room in Economy Seats,"A very long flight from LA to Dubai with final destination in Jo-burg. Flight on time, no problems with connection or luggage. Flight staff friendly and helpful. The legroom was good, better than expected but seat width fell inches short of my shoulders resulting in several bumps by people passing by my aisle seat during the flight despite my efforts to sit closely to my wife beside me. I am a 44 long suit size 6 foot male but the seat width is designed for someone with narrower shoulders. This issue is common to airlines today unless you pay lots more money for other than economy seats, but as to legroom, Emirates did better. Food is OK, entertainment options very good - movies, audio choices, etc. recent and older. Nice headphones, not ear buds, much more comfortable. Seating in sections provide several bathrooms between sections, much needed for such long flights. My most serious complaint, which is now also common with airlines, is the option to pay extra for each flight segment to reserve a specific seat. If you want to sit next to someone (spouse, child, parent, etc.) you must pay extra to guarantee this otherwise seat assignment for free can only be done 48 hours prior to flight. What a horrible idea airlines use to squeeze out more money from you! I booked this flight 8 months earlier, and refused to let Emirates take advantage of their greed. Fortunately my wife and I got seats together assigned for free, but other passengers were not so lucky and negotiated with others during boarding to switch seats so they could sit together. Some negotiations were successful but in all cases this action delayed boarding because of these conversations blocked aisles and created some embarrassing and stressful conversations. If Emirates and other airlines want to stand apart from the competition, seat selection for any specific class of seats must be free, with first purchased, first served. Stop the greed! Because we sat together for no extra charge, I rate good value for money. If we didn't sit together, I would rate average (average because the rating bar is now much lower than in the past) for value.",August 2018,Emirates,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729069-Reviews-Emirates,World,flights,4.0,4.0
"Interesting variety, friendly vendors, but good negotiating skills needed","If Jo-burg is your first stop in your visit to South Africa, this market is a nice introduction to the variety of crafts products you will find. Paintings and other art items, carved wood and stone products, beaded items, clothing, African masks, etc. No marked prices so ask and negotiate like crazy if you are interested in an item. The vendors are friendly and accept the negotiation dance as part of the market experience here. Be comfortable and reasonable in your part in this dance with the realization that you will likely find an equal or better product in other parts of South Africa at a better price without needing as strong negotiating skills. Everyone trying to make a living and you can enjoy the experience for what it is and maybe find something you want. It is fun just to walk through the place and talk casually with the person in the booth. If you don't like the negotiating part, you would give this place 2 stars. If that doesn't bother you, then the variety of items, many friendly vendors, and the general experience gives it 4 stars. I bought a little something and was happy with my purchase.

Beyond here most folks take the park bus. Check online for more information.

Great pho in Anchorage,"Came from California to visit friend in Anchorage. He never had pho before so it was time to introduce him to this treat. Not knowing what to expect I had some concerns but they disappeared when food arrived. We had shrimp spring rolls, the steak #2 and beef stew #4 pho. All delicious. The peanut dipping sauce very tasty. Service great, attentive and helpful. I've had pho in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and in the lower 48. This place holds it own with very good broth and fresh ingredients. I recommend a visit, you will not be disappointed.

More than a Metro,"This is a must see, repeat, must see, when you are in Moscow. You can pay to have a guided tour, but it is fun and very safe and inexpensive and you can take more time to enjoy and explore and see the city folks various stations live this part of their lives. Look to various web sites that discuss the the metro and arrange your own journey to 3-5 or more of the metro stations. Each station is different. Enjoy the mosaics, or the stained glass, or murals, or the brass statues (my favorite station - see the statues that are rubbed for good luck and notice that no matter how rushed the commuters are many still take time for their good luck rub). Folks prize these stations and keep them clean and secure.",April 2016,Moscow Metro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298484-d300623-Reviews-Moscow_Metro-Moscow_Central_Russia.html,"Moscow, Russia",attractions,5.0,4.5
A Sacramento landmark that tastes great!,"Treat yourself at least once to the legendary Frank Fat's Restaurant. I never had anything less than a great meal here and great service. It is more expensive than where I usually dine, but worth treating myself. I am not a fan of banana cream pie, a star item here, so I have the chocolate cream pie instead and find it very tasty. This is where I had my first honey walnut shrimp oh so many years ago, and it is still the best place to get this wonderful dish.",December 2016,Frank Fat's Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32999-d339794-Reviews-Frank_Fat_s_Restaurant-Sacramento_California.html,"Sacramento, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5
