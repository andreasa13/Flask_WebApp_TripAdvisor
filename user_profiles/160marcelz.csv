Great atmosphere and value for money,"We had a great stay at Archontico hotel. Georgos and his wife are most helpful hosts and the hotel has a lovely atmosphere. The breakfast is good, the terras overlooking the value is great and the family rooms are the best. The pool is a bit cold but and the bathrooms could be upgraded but those were the only improvements we could think of. We had a marvellous stay and we hope to be back!",August 2019,Archontiko Metsovou Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g736014-d953287-Reviews-Archontiko_Metsovou_Boutique_Hotel-Metsovo_Ioannina_Region_Epirus.html,"Metsovo, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Good service that may be improved,"At 08:00 in Aug. there is already a long line so it feels great to skip that. The ticket needs to be picked up first in the city, which is a bit of a hassle.
