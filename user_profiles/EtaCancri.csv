Was very disappointing this time...,"Now we have moved to Cyprus, we decided to come back for a pint after having a great visit in July this year.. No one wanted to serve us this time.. Never mind serving, they didn't even awknoledge us. We were refused to be served cos we sat at the wrong table even though the waiter gave us a sign to sit anywhere we wanted from the other side of the yard not even bothering to come over.. Once they eventually took our order (when we moved tables and tried to order at the bar which they refused to do either), it took them another ten minutes to serve us until I actually asked them to pour us our drinks. Took us probably over 30 minutes to just get our pints... And we were in hurry... Very poor customer service. I felt stupid while sitting there. Will not come back.

P. S. To be fair the beer we ordered was nice so they get ""poor"" overall from me.",September 2017,Aphrodite's Rock Brewing Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190384-d4782416-Reviews-Aphrodite_s_Rock_Brewing_Company-Paphos_Paphos_District.html,"Paphos, Cyprus",attractions,2.0,5.0
