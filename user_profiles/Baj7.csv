Incredible!,"Unbelievable that these structures where built so long ago by hand. An incredible achievement. Washrooms are hard to find, I limited my liquid intake.

Well maintained,"Really enjoyed carriage ride around park. Worth noting that city shuts horse rides down about noon if it gets to hot. We just made ours before it was shut for the day. Carful of street sellers a lot of time they are scams, buy online or directly from drivers. We walked from Hampton Manhattan about 35 min walk. Tried to use Uber back, someone told us to share ride I’ll never do that again as they kept rescheduling ride with different drivers pay the extra $5.",June 2019,Central Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d105127-Reviews-Central_Park-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.5
Still a marvel after all these years,"Building is very well kept up. It’s designed to handle a lot of people, we went in. The evening, it was quieter not really much for line ups so we didn’t pay the extra to to get up there quicker. Staff is very efficient in keeping lines moving.

Great park,"Enjoyed game in the smaller park. Jays spanked Boston so that was a plus for us being Canadians lol. Friendly park and great fans! One thing I got caught on is gate D is not between C and E it’s on the other side of the park which made us a little late. We ate just outside the park at Landsdowne pub food was reasonable and fairly quick. Another issue I had was my daughter had booked us a pick from a limo service as we where pressed for time after the game, he was to pick us at jersey and van ness. That area isn’t available for pick up, it’s blocked for people exiting the game. The driver didn’t seem to know that so wasted some time I didn’t have getting picked up..",June 2019,Fenway Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60745-d105250-Reviews-Fenway_Park-Boston_Massachusetts.html,"Boston, Massachusetts",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice tour,"Good day, didn’t really see a lot of fish. Sailed to spot but powered home. It’s nice warm water. I have had better cat trips for sure but was not the worst, pretty basic cruise. No munchies, swizzle was excellent. Captain was entertaining. I really appreciate a fresh water rinse when I get out of water, some boats do some don’t and this boat doesn’t.

Likely the worst service ever,"Trip started with our carry on weight was over , check in weighed it and said it would be $240 if we wanted to check it or we could take it on plane. Got to boarding a miserable loading attendant made us check bags and said it would be $50 each but she charged us $60 saying they wouldn’t make the flight. All our meds were in the carry on, we didn’t think nor did attendants think to ask if we had them. We had to taxi back to airport when next flight came in. No service, not even a glass of water on a 3hr flight. Knees where on the seat ahead of me. Probably one thing I am getting very aggravated with is the intercom, the attendants are bored with there job and plat out there instructions cutting off or missing words assuming your catching what they are throwing but I didn’t understand very little of it. they do have some good routes unfortunately so we used them but pretty sure it’s going to be a long time before it happens again.",January 2018,Jetstar Airways - Australia & New Zealand,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729146-Reviews-Jetstar-Airways-Australia-New-Zealand,World,flights,2.0,3.0

If you stay go to the room and ensure it works before you take room. My wife also enjoys having a sit down area with a mirror with a wing for doing her hair makeup, no such area.

They tried!,Captain Robert and Tyler trolled us around and put in a good effort however this is my second full day of fishing the Kona area with no results which leaves me thinking it is pretty poor value. I am disappointed there is no bait option especially when the bite is poor you might try changing methods. Dragging hardware around hour after hour wasting fuel and time. This seems to be the method used by most operators in this area and I can't see the value as it basically a $1000 a day for a good chance of no action.
