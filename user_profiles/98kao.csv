Lovely authentic greek food.,The food was delicious and great value with the 3 course mid-week deal at £18.90 each. Staff were lovely too. Cocktails were also delicious. We had a great night.,February 2019,Yiannis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1657430-d3693832-Reviews-Yiannis-Beeston_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Beeston, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Amazing Thai restaurant!,"The food was superb and we can't wait to go back and try more of the dishes - there is so much to choose from on the menu! The staff were lovely and friendly, and we had a really good night. Great value coming to just under £30 for our two mains and side dishes. Highly recommend.",February 2019,Sanchans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1657430-d4244835-Reviews-Sanchans-Beeston_Nottinghamshire_England.html,"Beeston, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Amazing food, service okay","The gyros here were delicious - we loved the pork gyros in the pita wrap which came with salad, tzatziki and potatoes.

The service was okay. On one visit we were told we had to move tables to order the gyros which we found a little confusing, especially as we had eaten the same meal at the same table on a different day.",September 2018,Just Pita,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10080710-Reviews-Just_Pita-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good sight to view,"This is a good sight to view and is free, next to the road so you can just walk up to it. Also nearby to Temple of Olympian Zeus and National Gardens so easy to do these together.

Not much information or things to do actually at the arch, but it was still nice to go and look at as we were in the area anyway for the other attractions.",September 2018,Arch of Hadrian (Pili tou Adrianou),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242820-Reviews-Arch_of_Hadrian_Pili_tou_Adrianou-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Amazing - go in the evening!,"We visited the Acropolis twice, once in the morning (around 9.30) and once in the evening (around 6.30). Would definitely recommend going in the evening - not only were they way less crowds but it was also less hot for the walk up, and we got an amazing view of the sunset at about 7.30 over Athens.

There are two entrances to walk up - one over near the Acropolis museum on the south side of the slope which is a slightly longer walk up (still very manageable though, coming from someone who is not very physically fit) but does take you past the Theatre of Dionysus and other structures. The other entrance is on the west side of the hill and is a shorter walk up but less scenic. In general I was expecting the walk up to be worse, but found it a lot easier than it looked! There is also a lift for those unable to manage the walk, but I believe you must contact them in advance to arrange this.

At the top the Acropolis entrance, the Parthenon and the Temple to Athena Nike were all amazing to see. The Parthenon was under some construction when we visited (Sept 2018) which was a shame as there was some scaffolding and a crane, but it was still a good sight.

Would recommend this as must see if you visit Athens. Visit the Acropolis museum first, as there isn't much information at the actual Acropolis as to the buildings or the history, so it's best to learn this at the museum first before you go up.",September 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Visit BEFORE you go to the Acropolis,"Great museum with loads of information about the history of the Acropolis. Definitely visit this museum BEFORE you see the Acropolis itself, because otherwise when you get up there you won't know what is going on at the top (there is very little information at the top itself).
Museum is filled with artefacts, statues and information about greek life.

Entry is reasonable, and if you are an EU student entry is free so bring your student ID! (Entry for non EU students is reduced I believe)",September 2018,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Delicious authentic food,"We went to this restaurant for lunch and dinner during our trip and both times were very pleased. The food was authentic, with local people dining around us giving us a very authentic greek experience.
For lunch we had the meats and cheese board which came fresh from their delicatessen counter and was absolutely delicious with greek cheeses, meats, bread and olive tapenade. Meals for dinner were also lovely, especially the beef with potatoes and peppers.

Staff and service were great, and we loved the atmosphere in this restaurant. Prices were also very reasonable as we were on a budget. Definitely recommend for an authentic local experience.",September 2018,Ta Karamanlidika tou Fani,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6852056-Reviews-Ta_Karamanlidika_tou_Fani-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice Mezze,"We visited this hotel our first night in Kos as it was opposite our hotel. We ordered the Greek Mezze for 2 people for £25, which included butter beans, tzatziki with pita, hummus with pita, stuffed vine leaves, meatballs, sausage casserole, grilled aubergines and baked feta in pastry. All of the dishes were very nice.

Service was good and friendly.",September 2018,Galinis restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g910630-d8153623-Reviews-Galinis_restaurant-Kefalos_Kos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Kós, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great authentic food,"We visited Stop Inn twice whilst staying in Kefalos and both times were happy to find authentic Greek dishes which we could have with roast potatoes rather than chips which everywhere else seemed to serve! Our favourite dish was the delicious prawn saganaki - definitely recommend. Ekmek dessert was also lovely.

Main meals costing under £10 each, beer and soft drinks £2-3 each, definitely value for money.

Hostess was lovely and service was good although we had to wait a while for our bill. Free drink at the end of the meal was nice too.",September 2018,Stop Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g910630-d4481293-Reviews-Stop_Inn-Kefalos_Kos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Kós, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Budget hotel in a fantastic location.,"The location of this hotel was perfect - down a side street just off the main road full of shops and restaurants, just a few minutes walk to Monastiraki, where there is also a metro station. All of the attractions (Acropolis, Ancient Agora, National Gardens, Syntagma, museums etc) are all within 10-20 minutes walk from the hotel.

Staff were lovely with 24 hour reception, the room was small and very basic (double bed, wardrobe, small ensuite) but clean and functional and for the price we weren't expecting more than basic. Cleaning every day with fresh sheets and towels. Small communal area also.

A few reviews on here mention that the location seems scary or dodgy but it really isn't. At night it may give that impression because there is graffiti everywhere, but this is the case in most of Athens. We were travelling as a young couple and felt perfectly safe walking around the area at night - it's literally right behind the main high street so plenty of people around, lots of lighting etc.

Would definitely recommend this hotel to those travelling on a budget and just looking for somewhere to crash at the end of the day - you really can't beat the location for being able to get around Athens.",September 2018,Hotel Athinaikon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d657464-Reviews-Hotel_Athinaikon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,3.5
Brilliant!,"Really great food and good service. I definitely recommend the bay bugs which were excellent, and the coconut prawn starter was also delicious. Lovely views of the water from the outside tables.",April 2017,House of Siam Thai Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g659070-d3191595-Reviews-House_of_Siam_Thai_Restaurant-Hope_Island_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html,"Hope Island, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Zip Lining was awesome!!,"The zip lining course with 7 zip lines was so incredible! The instructor guides were really friendly and fun and calmed everyone's nerves, then took us round the amazing course! Definitely recommend to all adults and teenagers - great for family or friend groups or for couples",April 2017,Thunderbird Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1424561-d2286851-Reviews-Thunderbird_Park-Tamborine_Mountain_Scenic_Rim_Brisbane_Region_Queensland.html,"Tamborine Mountain, Australia",attractions,5.0,4.0
Great fun!,"I did the Science Lab escape room and had great fun! We were a group of 6 friends so it worked out quite good value at £15 per person. It was challenging but good fun and we finished it with 10 minutes to spare! I'd definitely recommend this for groups of adults or teenagers! Now I want to go back and try the other room!
It's a little hard to find as it's down a back street but google maps got us there ;) Don't think there is any parking so park in a main car park and walk over.",January 2017,Cyantist - Bournemouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186262-d7235127-Reviews-Cyantist_Bournemouth-Bournemouth_Dorset_England.html,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
Always enjoy it,"I always enjoy visiting Camden, even if I don't but anything. Lots of stalls with interesting products at good prices, and loads of lovely food to buy (free samples given out as you walk past - yes please!) Easy to get to via the tube at Camden station.
