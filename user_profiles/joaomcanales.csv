Best in town,"We were looking for another cafe but we stopped by here by mistake. But this was the best mistake on our visit to Istanbul. That doner kebab and the orange juice was fantastic, absolutely fantastic! We were lucky to find this place. Working guys got their mask on, they were keeping the social distance and most importantly they were very nice. We had our second shock when we saw the prices because the prices was really reasonable. This place is very good for a quick lunch.",February 2021,YIldIz Bufe - Since 1967,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d17212896-Reviews-YIldIz_Bufe_Since_1967-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Spice Town!,We came to Istanbul with two luggages but thanks to my girlfriend's addiction authentic flavours we are gonna need another luggage. She bought everything she saw!
