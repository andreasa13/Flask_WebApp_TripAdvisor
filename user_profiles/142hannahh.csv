Fantastic again,"3rd visit and still just as amazing.
Friendly service, delicious food, great atmosphere and a lovely espresso martini.
I'm sure we'll go many more times in the (not too distant) future!",October 2020,Domo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d19213618-Reviews-Domo-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Time flies when you're having fun!,"4 of us went on a rainy afternoon. We had only booked for 2 hours but otherwise would have definitely stayed longer. None of us have ever been to anywhere like this before and to be honest I wouldn't have even considered it if we weren't trying to entertain visitors in such poor weather but we all had a great time!
Huge selection of games and labelled with the difficulty. Great selection of hot drinks, beers and cakes so there was something for everyone.
We will definitely go back either with others or even just the two of us.",August 2020,The Treehouse board game cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d13164336-Reviews-The_Treehouse_board_game_cafe-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Great restaurant!,"We've been twice now. Once back in March when it was chucking it down (we were greeted with a free glass of prosecco each for 'braving the rain') and then again tonight.
Tonight we sat outside due to the lovely sunshine and now I can say the atmosphere is great whether you are inside or outside.
On both occasions the food has been delicious and the service very friendly and efficient.
Would highly recommend.",August 2020,Domo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d19213618-Reviews-Domo-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Useful way to get around,"We usually like to travel independently but it was proving tricky for us to get from Lima to Paracus and back in our time frame so we used Peru Hop. It provides a really good bus service and you can then add on trips and accommodation as you wish (even as late as on the bus if you want). The trips we booked were all excellent (boat tour in Paracus and dune buggies in Huachachina) and the guides were all very nice. A particularly big thank you to one guide though, Claudia. On returning to Lima there was a misunderstanding about where we were staying but she sorted it so quickly and calmly.
I would definitely recommend Peru Hop for anyone for the odd trip whilst in Peru or for longer stints for solo or less confident travellers.",August 2019,Peru Hop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294316-d6224644-Reviews-Peru_Hop-Lima_Lima_Region.html,"Lima, Peru",attractions,4.0,4.5
Love this place,"Been so many times so I'm not sure why I've never reviewed it before. Amazing staff, great food and a nice atmosphere. Every dish I've had from here has always been great and they'll cook it to your spice level if you ask. It can of course get really busy on a Fri/Sat night so then service is slower but I'm quite happy to make an evening out of it. The only thing that has ever bothered me is we were told once by the staff that if you tip via card the management keep it rather than waiting staff which I think is totally unreasonable but I'm hoping this has now changed.",August 2018,7 Spices Balti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d817629-Reviews-7_Spices_Balti-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Traditional pub,If you've got a wine or cocktail drinker with you this isn't the place but the beer selection is really good and kept well. It's also got a nice beer garden and efficient staff.,September 2018,The Wellington,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d6656511-Reviews-The_Wellington-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Not as good as it was,We went here a lot when it first opened as it has a nice outdoor bit for when it's sunny and it was really good value for money but was disappointed with the food this time. My stew must have been bottom of the batch as there were lumps of unblended roux at the bottom and my partners meatballs just tasted of herbs and no meat. They've also put the price up and rarely change the menu. The staff are still good so we'll probably return again for drinks but skip on the food.,September 2018,"Stew & Oyster, Kelham Island",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d12830505-Reviews-Stew_Oyster_Kelham_Island-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Good value for money,The room was a bit tired looking but clean and a reasonable size. We didn't have breakfast or even speak to a member of staff because of the electronic check in but it worked fine. We were only staying two nights but they still came in to make the bed and replenish the coffee tray. Only downside was because it's not double glazed you can hear the seagulls a lot throughout the night. Good value for money.,August 2018,Carlton House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190744-d12828941-Reviews-Carlton_House-Scarborough_Scarborough_District_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Great food,"I've been to this restaurant twice now, both times in a very large group and yet they've still managed to accomodate us. All the food was excellent (oysters, pate, mussels) and the bill was very reasonable considering the quantity of food and wine we had. William (the owner) is very entertaining and all the staff were polite. The only downside was we were only given 4 menus to look at between 15 of us but they did get us a couple more when we asked. Will definitely go back again.",August 2018,Cafe Fish,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190744-d784963-Reviews-Cafe_Fish-Scarborough_Scarborough_District_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Disappointing dinner,"I had drank in the hotel before but never eaten there and was pleasantly surprised by the service at dinner. In the bar you have to wait a very long time even for basic drinks but the restaurant was much better. My starter was nice (baked camembert) but the main was very disappointing. I had the tuna steak that was so overcooked it was like eating tinned tuna, the steak and the mushroom were practically rolled in pepper and the vegetables were really over cooked and soggy.",August 2018,Taste Restaurant and Cafe Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190744-d1161698-Reviews-Taste_Restaurant_and_Cafe_Bar-Scarborough_Scarborough_District_North_Yorkshire_En.html,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Great pub,"Great atmosphere, lively enough but still cosy and always good music on. The staff are all brilliant - friendly and efficient. The beer is always decent and very reasonably priced. Not eaten dinner here yet but the brunch is lovely (especially the bean hash dish).",August 2018,The Closed Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d5498770-Reviews-The_Closed_Shop-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Underwhelming,We got there early which was definitely for the best as the queue wasn't very long and it wasn't TOO hot. €20 per person is quite expensive for a historical site. The scale of the buildings is quite impressive but it starts to lose its charm when you realise that some bits are just plaster cast replicas of the original features which are now in the museum instead.,August 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Nice pub,A nice pub to go to for a few beers either on a sunny day or to shelter from the rain. Good selection of beers always on. Only problem is it can get really busy and then the staff struggle to keep up with the demand but they are always polite and cheerful.,August 2018,The Old Scalby Mills,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190744-d3521786-Reviews-The_Old_Scalby_Mills-Scarborough_Scarborough_District_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Lovely staff,"There's always a good selection of beers on. Relaxed atmosphere with incredibly friendly staff and regulars. There's a lovely view from the terrace out the back. Their Sunday roasts are one of the best in Sheffield - no frills, just a very large portion of homecooked tasty food.",August 2018,Hillsborough Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186364-d245481-Reviews-Hillsborough_Hotel-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
Lovely room,"We had two connected rooms and a private bathroom so it was very spacious, especially considering the price. The room was spotlessly clean. Great location, in a lovely suburb outside of Athens. Within 25mins you can either get into central Athens by using the metro or walk down to the coast. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby. The airport pick up was helpful. The only issues we had were the amount of mosquitos in the garden, although I accept this can't really be helped maybe breakfast shouldn't be served in the garden. The other issue was breakfast, we had prebooked breakfast for all 3 days when we booked the room. We were asked for the first day what time we wanted it and it was delicious and good value for money. We didn't see them for the rest of the day so we assumed it would just be at the same time the next day but breakfast wasn't prepared. It didn't really bother us as we just picked something up from a bakery and we weren't charged for it but a bit of clarity would have been useful. Overall though it was a very pleasant stay and I would happily recommend it.",August 2018,Veggie Garden Athens B&B,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2136990-d3400760-Reviews-Veggie_Garden_Athens_B_B-Elliniko_Attica.html,"Elliniko, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great barman,"Lovely atmospheric bar in a good location for people watching and a decent selection of beers (IPA and APA instead of just generic lager).
The main reason for this review though is that one of the barmen was so friendly and helpful. We had an issue with our apartment (the door handle came off which meant I had to climb through a window to get out) and the landlady didn't speak much English so we asked the bar man if he'd ring her for us. He did and got the issue ""sorted"". When we went back the next day he asked if we were ok now and we told him it would be our last beer as we were flying that night. The bar man ran up the road and came back with a fridge magnet for each of us to remember Tbilisi which was very sweet.",August 2018,Jazz at Konka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294195-d4894348-Reviews-Jazz_at_Konka-Tbilisi.html,"Tbilisi, Georgia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Well organised tour in beautiful landscape,"Well organised tour with an entertaining guide and beautiful scenery. The accommodation was good, comfortable and clean with excellent food. Be aware that the tourist infrastructure in Kazbegi is quite structured so you tend to go to the same spots as everyone else. There's not much chance to get off the beaten track, even with a guide, unless you are into really serious hiking/climbing. To try to avoid the crowds, ask your guide to set off relatively early in the mornings.",August 2018,Highlander Travel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294195-d6834220-Reviews-Highlander_Travel-Tbilisi.html,"Tbilisi, Georgia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Lovely restaurant,Went in first of all just for a beer - great selection. We looked at the menu and decided we would return later as there was a lot of variety from pizza and salads to traditional greek options. The service was excellent with the waiter even making beer suggestions for us and the food was delicious and for a reasonable price. Two starters and two mains was definitely too much for us but in fairness the waiter had tried to warn us!,August 2018,Athena`s Cook,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4834389-Reviews-Athena_s_Cook-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing customer service and experience,"I wanted to book a wine tasting for my parent's whilst they are in Lucca. Although they currently don't have a way to pay for tastings online, they very quickly replied to my email and organised for me to ""order"" wine to the same value and pay on paypal for it. My parents went this afternoon and said it was fantastic, the hosts were ""very interesting"" and ""fab"". The customer service was excellent throughout and my parent's loved it. Thank you!",March 2018,Fattoria al Dotto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187898-d9563811-Reviews-Fattoria_al_Dotto-Lucca_Province_of_Lucca_Tuscany.html,"Lucca, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Best Indian Takeaway!,We have been using Rubeez for over 3 years now. We originally only used it as it was the closest but even since moving it is the only one we regularly order from. We have never had to wait more than 25mins for collection and 40mins for delivery which I think is reasonable. The food is always amazing! The dishes do tend to be on the spicy side which is fine by me but in the past I have had friends request it to be fairly mild and they have always been happy to do this. I have tried quite a few things on the menu but my favourite is definitely the North Indian chilli garlic chicken. Have never sat in the restaurant so can't comment but as a takeaway it is excellent!,August 2014,Rubeez,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d1317651-Reviews-Rubeez-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
