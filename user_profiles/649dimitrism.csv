Really the worst service ever !,"Although kitchen wasn’t bad it was nothing special either, at least for the price asked.
The service was terrible beyond anything I have ever seen in the western world. Poor management and customer experience. They destroyed our night, it was so obvious that in the end they didn’t charge us anything. Really sad....",August 2019,Glyko Lemoni,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189432-d14176990-Reviews-Glyko_Lemoni-Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
History unraveled,"A timeless masterpiece of architecture, in the heart of a vibrant area in Athens. Definitely a must see. Dress lightly in the summer, with comfortable shoes, as there is some walking. Do not forget to visit the Acropolis museum just few hundred meters away. Also keep in mind that there have been reported few pick pocketing incidents, so secure money and valuables in internal/zipper pockets. Don't miss out the numerous cafes in Thission and Plaka which will offer refreshing drinks and rewarding view, after your visit.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
