Lovely castle with extensive views,"Fantastic example of a concentric castle , not for the faint hearted , built by Edward 1 to protect the central part of wales to control the welsh . Booking is required as times are strictly adhered to due to COVID restrictions, this actually is a bonus because it means the castle can be viewed relatively easily without too many other people to spoil the atmosphere, a wonderful guide ,very knowledgeable about the castle ,in the centre courtyard was on hand to answer any queries ,the area is lovely and the town has the dubious attraction of having the steepest road in Britain !",September 2020,Harlech Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551984-d190550-Reviews-Harlech_Castle-Harlech_Snowdonia_National_Park_North_Wales_Wales.html,"Harlech, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Absolutely superb!,"Not to be missed , the vibrant colours and wonderful lighting in the tomb were a wonderful sight to behold , you are only allowed ten minutes but could do with longer to take it all in , fantastic to have had this experience.",November 2019,Tomb of Queen Nefertari,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294205-d12134904-Reviews-Tomb_of_Queen_Nefertari-Luxor_Nile_River_Valley.html,"Luxor, Egypt",attractions,5.0,5.0
Sonesta st George 1,"Superb travelling experience on the sonesta cruise boat , comfortable room with fantastic views of the Nile , air conditioning in all rooms , very comfortable and serviced daily , food was of an extremely high standard with different dishes every day , entertainment most nights but to be honest we went to bed as the trips tired us out , some never to be forgotten sights .There is a pool on top deck and a couple of small shops on board , this boat is elegantly furnished and not overcrowded so the feeling of being in a small group is maintained , all the staff were excellent , nothing was too much trouble, and as we were in a small groups visiting the historical sites was a lovely experience, the main complaint is the amount of rubbish polluting the river which I suppose is part and parcel of modern life but could do with addressing, anyone who uses the horse drawn carts would be upset at the sight of some of the animals but we were told this situation is improving , there is an obvious tourist police presence and security never felt like an issue though running the gauntlet of the souvenir vendors was at times a daunting experience !",November 2019,Nile River Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294205-d15328555-Reviews-Nile_River_Cruise-Luxor_Nile_River_Valley.html,"Luxor, Egypt",attractions,4.0,4.0
Fantastic and not to be missed !,"Wonderful sights and atmosphere, but so very very busy and beware the touts, sellers and poor looking animals ! The pyramids at Sakkara (the stepped pyramidand it’s complex along with the collapsed pyramid of unas ).At dahshur ( the bent and the red pyramid) have an atmosphere which seems more redolent of the ancient times and one gets a feeling of the emptiness of the deserts in which they were built .",November 2019,Pyramids of Giza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294202-d317746-Reviews-Pyramids_of_Giza-Giza_Giza_Governorate.html,"Giza, Egypt",attractions,4.0,4.5
Think about when to visit !,"We visited the museum and had a fabulous full day , we saw the palette of narmer, Tutankhamun treasures , the scribe and other fantastic things as well as visiting the mummy room far far too much to mention , but and it is a big but from now until the new museum opens hopefully in late next year various exhibits are disappearing piece by piece and the museum is a building site with empty cabinets abounding and to be honest the exhibits need to have better and more descriptive labelling this would make the experience an outstanding one as the contents are world class but presented in a disappointing way that somewhat dulls the experience so anyone visiting I would say wait until the new museum opens next year ! A museum of world class exhibits presented appallingly .",November 2019,The Museum of Egyptian Antiquities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294201-d308825-Reviews-The_Museum_of_Egyptian_Antiquities-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Cairo, Egypt",attractions,4.0,4.5
Not as expected,"Called for a meal about 5pm , half the restaurant was closed off , when we asked if we could have a meal we were told they couldn’t accommodate us at all , the staff were actually quite rude and unwelcoming and couldn’t be bothered to check whether they had a table for later , just walked off and proceeded to ignore us , maybe ok but wouldn’t bother even trying this again , not very impressed at all !",September 2019,The Shepherd & Shepherdess Inn Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1982745-d4087278-Reviews-The_Shepherd_Shepherdess_Inn_Restaurant-Beamish_Stanley_County_Durham_England.html,"Beamish, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Surpassed expectations,"Wonderful visit to beamish over two days , trams buses and lots of things to experience , the only downside was not many exhibits were actually doing much , apparently they were short staffed , and no horse drawn vehicles or farm animals were on show or working . For the disabled visitor it would be a challenge as only one vehicle was equipped to transport wheelchair users and you need to do lots of walking .All said a wonderful trip and well worth seeing.",September 2019,Beamish Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1982745-d216478-Reviews-Beamish_Museum-Beamish_Stanley_County_Durham_England.html,"Beamish, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Little known gem of an attraction,"This was the fort that supplied hadrians wall for the Romans’ , reconstructed buildings and friendly willing helpful staff made this a gem of a place to visit , little known to ordinary folk it was a lovely treat to find this , lucky we got to see it as they shut at the end of sept till next season , we’ll worth a visit for anyone interested in the Roman history of the region .",September 2019,"Arbeia, South Shields Roman Fort",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g504186-d566492-Reviews-Arbeia_South_Shields_Roman_Fort-South_Shields_Tyne_and_Wear_England.html,"South Shields, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Well kept house .,"Lovely house built by and lived in by the same family (the Terry chocolate )till bought by the national trust , the house itself was a bit disappointing but the garden and tea room were superb , a lovely peek into a pre and post Second World War life of a wealthy family of the time .",July 2019,Goddards House and Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186346-d2181540-Reviews-Goddards_House_and_Garden-York_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"York, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Henry v,"We were expecting at least a decent performance, sadly it was abysmal , poor projection meant we could in almost every scene not make out the spoken word .The production was disjointed and seemed to consist of unconnected ideas that failed to provide a coherent vision of the play .An extremely poor production (we left at the interval ) we could find nothing positive to say .The drinks and food were very expensive , very very disappointed .I can see why there were very few people attending and lots of empty seats .",July 2019,Shakespeare's Rose Theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186346-d14770909-Reviews-Shakespeare_s_Rose_Theatre-York_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"York, United Kingdom",attractions,1.0,4.5
Superb atmospheric experience!,"We visited and watched “Tamburlaine “ , a very atmospheric and “bloody”performance , the theatre itself is a wonderful place but not so much the cafe/bar in the foyer absolutely heaving all the time , the seating isn’t as comfy so made for a bit of moving about , not just myself I noticed either ! My first visit and well worth it !",November 2018,Swan Theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186399-d219208-Reviews-Swan_Theatre-Stratford_upon_Avon_Warwickshire_England.html,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Superb Setting - but !,"Absolutely superb setting and grounds as befitting an old Cistercian abbey , staff and service were excellent but the sheer volume of people attending for weddings etc meant that when we arrived at 5.45 pm we couldn’t order a meal in the restaurant and only had 15mins. for ordering at the bar for food to be eaten in our room , which to be honest was excellent but they only brought one knife and fork so the food was cold when my partner got his ! The room at first glance was luxurious, but it was heated with electric fan heaters , the chairs for watching tv when you sat in them the springs had gone so you sat on the floor , the four poster bed corners were plastic drainpipe covered with a sleeve of fabric , the bed was comfortable and very clean . A large room , well appointed but tatty furnishings and no heating only the electric fan heater ! Due to the fireworks going off and the three police cars and van arriving to deal with a problem it rather spoiled a wonderful place . Breakfast was excellent with a fantastic choice and lovely staff. Expensive but worth it , try to stay in the week as weekends seem noisy and rushed with weddings etc !",November 2018,Coombe Abbey Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186403-d192814-Reviews-Coombe_Abbey_Hotel-Coventry_West_Midlands_England.html,"Coventry, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5

Booked through viator a trip advisor booking system !,"Absolutely superb trip to Delos , we took the half day trip , and our tour guide Angela went out of her way to assist us as somehow we booked for 2019 online instead of 2018 , she quickly arranged our pickup and we enjoyed the trip immensely, a micro explanation of the site and its history , just not long enough !",October 2018,"DELOS, the island of god Apollo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189430-d16641864-DELOS_the_island_of_god_Apollo-Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
Fantastic archeological site!,"Absolutely stunning trip to Delos , we went with an organised tour guide who was excellent there were only 9 of us on our tour , this gave us an educated micro explanation as to the history and importance of the site , the only problem was there wasn’t enough time to look around properly and explore fully this fantastic archeological site , definitely worth another visit !",October 2018,Archaeological Site of Delos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g202339-d4297568-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Delos-Delos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Delos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Remarkable experience !,"We were enjoying a lovely meal here , my partner had a rabbit stifado when in amongst the meat and sauce was a one euro coin ! Not quite sure who was tipping here ! a pleasant meal , the waiters just laughed as did we at the time but maybe others may not have been so happy !

Lovely - but!,"A lovely hotel and very modern and clean looking in the reception and dining area , with friendly helpful staff .But when we got to our room it was a different matter although clean the bed we booked were twin beds , they were old and extremely hard and uncomfortable , low and rickety . The bathroom yet again was clean but smelled strongly of stale water ,the shower was over the bath which was rusty around the plug and stained , the shower bracket was hanging off the wall and awkward to position , a good bed and a decent bathroom should be a priority not an afterthought ! Well positioned for the old town and little Venice with trips to Delos available in the harbour , a 15 minute downhill walk to get there but be advised it is uphill to get back and the roads are narrow so be careful , we caught the local beach buses which dropped us off outside the hotel on our way back .",October 2018,Vienoula's Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g662620-d618819-Reviews-Vienoula_s_Garden-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.5
Well worth the trek !,"Ancient Thera is at the top of a mountain and well worth a visit for anyone enjoying archeology . Just a word of warning it is worth the 10euro fare for a mini bus up and down the winding road then to access the site it is a tiring uphill climb to the summit , the stunning views alone are superb and the bus allows two hours visit which is ample time to inspect the remains of the ancient Hellenistic city .",October 2018,Ancient Thera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g658914-d243145-Reviews-Ancient_Thera-Kamari_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Fantastic museum.,"Superb visit to this museum , well worth a visit , not just artefacts from the acropolis but all Greek and roman too , thousands of artefacts from the rich and fertile history that abounds here .The courtyard cafe was an excellent place to have a drink and snack about halfway , the shop though left a lot to be desired , very poor choice of stock a ,memento might have been nice.Certainly a very good choice for our first day in Greece.",October 2018,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Wonderful visit !,"Lovely visit and well worth the hike to the top , not for people with walking problems as the ground is uneven in parts , by 9.30 am it was absolutely heaving and the selfie sticks were out in force , a tip is to buy your tickets beforehand as the queues were up to half an hour to get in , beware of getting caught in amongst the large groups as these block anyone from getting past them in some narrow parts !
All in we visited a fantastic place with some of the best history in the world but the amount of people made the experience a bit stressful at times !

Not a satisfied customer!,"My partner and I went for a meal , usually very good , I ordered a barbecue meal with ribs chicken and meatballs expecting it to be a smoky barbecue sauce , I couldn’t eat it because there was so much chilli it swamped every other flavour and it definitely didn’t taste like a barbecue sauce ! The other complaint was that there were no vegetables , only chips with my meal,and upon asking we were told they didn’t do them ! they could do me a side salad which consisted of lettuce two bits of tomato and two bits of cucumber in a very small dish drizzled with dressing , my partner had a lamb shank which came with a spoon of mash , yet again no veg of any description ,extremely disappointed as this is usually a good place for a meal !The waitress asked was everything ok and when I said about the meal she just smiled and said , yes the meatballs are a bit warm ! she saw my meal was virtually untouched and just walked away , we were ignored from this point on , my partner paid the bill and we came away , we will not be using this restaurant again !",August 2018,The Ferryboat Bar and Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g19080764-d2286815-Reviews-The_Ferryboat_Bar_and_Kitchen-West_Butterwick_Lincolnshire_England.html,"West Butterwick, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.5
