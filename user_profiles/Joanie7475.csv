Fun day out!!,"Really enjoyed the day - the hire was easy, seamless and the guys there were so helpful. Would highly recommend and would use again. Really good way to see the new forest.",September 2020,Cyclexperience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190805-d6131997-Reviews-Cyclexperience-Brockenhurst_New_Forest_National_Park_Hampshire_Hampshire_England.html,"Brockenhurst, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
Disorganised and weird atmosphere,"We went here as a group dinner after a conference, seating was not great - all squashed up and no room to move. It clearly was not suitable for a party of 8 or more. There was no atmosphere and starters were brought out the same time as mains so it was all abit cramped on the table and didn’t have a relaxed chatty atmosphere as you felt rushed.",January 2020,Yoleni's Greek Gastronomy Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d11851409-Reviews-Yoleni_s_Greek_Gastronomy_Center-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Looks beautiful but website needs updating,We tried to see the Acropolis on the last day of a work conference as we finished early but when we arrived it was closed. Their website had said 8-8pm but when we got there at 6 it was closed - hugely disappointing! We couldn’t walk round as it was gated all around and everywhere was pitch black.,January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Beautiful views,"Came here as part of work conference. The view of the Acropolis from the hotel restaurant was beautiful but my room was a big disappointment. Not only did I face some air conditioning unit but the only day when I could have a lie in, I was rudely awaken at 8am by the sound of pneumatic drilling which vibrated the back of my wall - not what you needed as a wake up call after a late night!!
The room had no thermostat and I was constantly cold or if I put on the fan I couldn’t sleep due to the noise. Food was buffet style - probably due to the fact we were such a large group but it got a bit boring after having it for lunch and dinner.",January 2020,St. George Lycabettus Lifestyle Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d198990-Reviews-St_George_Lycabettus_Lifestyle_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
Amazing sushi,"Had the most amazing sushi here and the chef is so sweet, takes pride in his food. He is always looking to see if we enjoyed the food and has a beaming smile when he sees enjoy the food.

Amazing fun !!,"We booked as a group of four for a birthday celebration and did the Wild West escape room. The puzzles were well thought out and flowed really well. David our games master was amazing - funny, helpful and really made us feel immersed in the world. David always kept us informed all the way of the times etc and was always on hand if ever we needed anything. Thoroughly enjoyed the event and will definetly be coming back to do another one.",April 2019,Escape Hunt Reading,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186363-d15518950-Reviews-Escape_Hunt_Reading-Reading_Berkshire_England.html,"Reading, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
Amazing hote,Beautiful hote in a perfect location right in the heart of Disney Springs. The hotel was clean and the staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast with Disney characters were a lovely touch! Would recommend and come back again.,October 2018,Hilton Orlando Lake Buena Vista,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34515-d217366-Reviews-Hilton_Orlando_Lake_Buena_Vista-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.0
Location was great and great staff,Stayed here for one night before we travelled to France. The room was very clean and the staff were so friendly and helpful. A lovely hotel and we would stay here again if ever we had an early start. Very convenient and loved being able to park the car there as we met up with friends and took only one car. Car was safe and we were impressed with the amount of parking spaces. We couldn’t give it 5* as there was limited choice at breakfast but still really good for a hotel being a stone throw away.,August 2018,Holiday Inn Express Folkestone Channel Tunnel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190749-d1059174-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Folkestone_Channel_Tunnel-Folkestone_Kent_England.html,"Folkestone, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
