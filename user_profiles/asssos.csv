Excellent resort,"My wife and I just returned from an amazing weekend spent at Columbia Beach Resort. Amazing surroundings, a hotel that blends perfectly with the environment. Every part of our sparkling clean. Very professional and smiling staff. Excellent breakfast with a large variety of food. Our junior suite overlooking the pool was simply amazing. I’m trying very hard to find something to criticize but can’t. We will definitely return.",February 2020,Columbia Beach Resort Pissouri,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616081-d571583-Reviews-Columbia_Beach_Resort_Pissouri-Pissouri_Limassol.html,"Pissouri, Cyprus",hotels,5.0,4.5
Disappointed,The restaurant was below bar during our stay in the hotel over the weekend. The cuisine was overwhelmed by last moment bookings. A hotel restaurant in a small village with only perhaps a couple of other restaurants that most probably close at 7pm due to covid measures should have take extra measures to accommodate all hotel guest for diner on time. The food was okay but I’m sure they can do better.,December 2020,Byzantino Restaurant at Casale Panayiotis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2266785-d8298987-Reviews-Byzantino_Restaurant_at_Casale_Panayiotis-Kalopanagiotis_Nicosia_District.html,"Kalopanagiotis, Cyprus",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Very good with flaws,"Loved the idea of turning several village houses into a small and cosy hotel. That means you may have to walk a bit or even climb some stairs to get into your room but for me this was no problem. Very good and clean facilities. Nice and cosy room with a small fireplace. Just love that!! Pet friendly! Another plus of this hotel. Unimpressive breakfast, come on you can do better than that. Even promote Cyprus breakfast to match the village image of the hotel. Spa facilities were nice clean and somewhat expensive. Not to mention that you better book in advance, even before you arrive to the hotel. The only major disappointment was the hotel restaurant. It looks that last night the cuisine was
overwhelmed with last minute bookings and it took them 1.5 hours to serve our main dish. Marios the head of the restaurant apologized to us for the delay and even filled out our glasses of wine complimentary of the restaurant which was a nice gesture but they still need to find a way to solve this problem as from what I understand the hotel is fully booked every weekend!! They can simply drop the a la cart menu and offer buffet if they can’t handle the pressure. Lastly but not least, both my wife and I were quite happy with the staff. Very polite and helpful. Would definitely recommend this place for a short peaceful stay despite the few shortcomings.",December 2020,Casale Panayiotis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2266785-d2238050-Reviews-Casale_Panayiotis-Kalopanagiotis_Nicosia_District.html,"Kalopanagiotis, Cyprus",hotels,4.0,4.5

Fantastic.,"This is the first time ever I write a review before leaving the establishment. But I feel they deserve it. Take the staff. Excellent. Very professional, very polite and smiling all the time. Plus they speak Greek! Sorry but I’m my country I want to speak my language. Facilities. Excellent and clean. Location. Excellent, overlooking a nice beach. Room. The sea view is amazing. Greeted with a champagne and a plate with fruits. Something that I have seen only in five star hotels i visited. Breakfast one of the best and they serve fresh juices!! All these at a fraction of the cost five star hotels charge us in Cyprus.

Good restaurant in the heart,"Good restaurant in the heart of Protaras. My pork chop was good although slightly dry. My wife’s kalamari was not cooked well so she returned it back. To their credit, they apologized and offered to replace it with another plate but as we already had a salad as a starter, she was full and politely refused. The kalamari was taken off the bill and offered to us a complimentary desert which again refused as this time I was full as well . I give them high marks with the way they handled the kalamari case and as these things do happen would definitely give them a second chance next time we are in Protaras.",September 2020,Vangelis Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g667803-d2625219-Reviews-Vangelis_Tavern-Protaras_Paralimni_Famagusta_District.html,"Protaras, Cyprus",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Review of their royal suite,"My wife and I were celebrating our 29th wedding anniversary last weekend so we decided to book the royal suite for 3 nights. Despite a few mishaps, we had an excellent time.

Location of the hotel is just perfect. It sits just a few meters away from one of the best beaches in Cyprus. The royal suite virtually a few steps away from the golden sand! Truly amazing.

The room itself is very nicely decorated and is set apart from the rest of the hotel. This is simply 5 star accommodation annexed to a four star hotel. A few delays in cleaning our room were dealt with in a very professional way by the General Manager of the hotel. My advise to them as a seasoned traveler is to specially train a couple of persons to look after the suite. A five star accommodation requires well trained staff for it.

Breakfast was very good with great variety of foods, dairy products and fruits. I’m rather disappointed with the lack of fresh juices and of the machine made coffees, another reminder that this is after all a four star hotel.

Large swimming pool for tourists and people who can’t really appreciate the crystal clear blue sea just a few steps away.

Hotel is clean and you can see disinfectants in key positions due to the Covid pandemic. Unfortunately, a great deal of people were not wearing any masks inside the elevator. Hotel should take steps to change this. You only need 1 Covid case to shut it down ‍️

Small parking place is a minus for the hotel although it doesn’t really affect overseas tourists.

Would I recommend the royal suite? For a normal luxurious stay with stunning views absolutely yes. For a special celebration that requires five star service I wouldn’t. Unless they decide to go this extra mile to offer it!",September 2020,Sunprime Protaras Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190385-d14190699-Reviews-Sunprime_Protaras_Beach-Paralimni_Famagusta_District.html,"Paralimni, Cyprus",hotels,4.0,4.5

Good value,"Very good hotel that was recently renovated. Clean spaces everywhere in the hotel including the room. COVID-19 conscious hotel, staff asking you to wear gloves in breakfast which earned good marks from me. Very good breakfast, great variety that you don’t usually find on a four star hotel. Very fast WiFi. My only negative remark is that WiFi is open. In an era where everything is done on smartphones including a lot of banking, open unsecured WiFi is a red flag! Is shows gross disrespect on your clients.

Never again,"One or two years ago I wrote a good review about this place. This year they burned my chicken souvlaki and the baycon in my wife’s hamburger. To be fair to them, the waiter asked me if I wanted to return my plate but I declined because I was hungry and didn’t want to wait for another 15 minutes for a new plate. When I asked for the bill, the waiter asked me how was our food. I told him burned. He told me he would inform the chef. No one came to apologize. This is the least I expected. I paid and left.

Disappointed,The quality of the coffees and sweets was very good. Even the prices are ok for Cyprus. Decor excellent. But the average rating has to do with the staff. They have to be polite at all times and not show their frustration to the customer if a misunderstanding takes place.

Having said that, This is still a very good hotel. All areas including our room was clean and bright. We chose the sea view room overlooking the beach area which is one of the nicest in Cyprus. Having stayed in the room only for sleep this was probably a waste.

Breakfast was very good, great variety of foods and fresh juices.

Some of the staff was excellent (mainly the Asian ones) and some of them looked quite bored. Unacceptable in any hotel! If they have their period they better stay at home.

Excellent restaurant,This was an unplanned visit to the restaurant so no previous reservation was made. Possibly that was the reason that it took them about an hour after we arrived to serve us. Under normal circumstances that would be a very big minus. But the food was excellent and prices better than average! The selection of food is very big and possibly unsustainable so in order to keep the freshness and excellence of their plates they may have to cut a big part of their menu! Definitely we will be returning to this restaurant not just for their excellent food but also to check that the delay in serving us was a one off,October 2019,East Asian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190383-d14421792-Reviews-East_Asian_Restaurant-Nicosia_Nicosia_District.html,"Nicosia, Cyprus",restaurants,5.0,4.5

It suit my purpose perfectly,I was in Copenhagen for 3 days on a short business trip and this hotel suit my purpose perfectly. Quick check in although I did not use the computers to do that. Clean room and all other facilities. Bed comfortable. Room is small but what the heck I used it only to get a good night sleep. Hotel very close to Copenhagen central station. Breakfast was extra €16 per day but then everything is so expensive in Copenhagen. Also drinking water I had to buy. Overall perfectly satisfied with my staying.,October 2019,"Wakeup Copenhagen, Bernstorffsgade",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189541-d15185910-Reviews-Wakeup_Copenhagen_Bernstorffsgade-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",hotels,5.0,4.0
