Well it was ok I suppose...,"From the outside, the museum had a lot of promise. Various fighter planes, helicopters and artillery paved the way to the internal exhibitions. Very cool.

Once inside though the museum was pretty bland. I say bland but we in Britain are spoilt by the Imperial War attractions and the Royal Armouries...context may be key here?

Overall, if you are passing by then take a look at the external exhibits but if you want to go in, don’t expect to be blown away...no pun intended.",March 2019,War Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d498309-Reviews-War_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Surreal views,What a stunning location. We walked from the Olympic stadium over to the Funicular and it was absolutely worth the steps. No where else in Athens will you get these views.,March 2019,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Hidden Gem...albeit on a morbid scale,"The walk from our apartment in Plaka to the cemetery was a little bit uninspiring but on arrival at the cemetery, you are blown away.

This is something wholly different to anything else in Athens. The monuments in the cemetery are fascinating. Albeit those buried in there are unknown to the likes of myself, you can pave through the grounds and take in a small part of there lives through pictures, memorial words and the design of the mausoleums.

Worth the walk.",March 2019,First Cemetery of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d8426708-Reviews-First_Cemetery_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautifully compliments the mountain site,"We visited the museum following our visit to the Acropolis area and Parthenon monument. I think we did it the right way round. But, I can see the benefits of going to the museum first...leave that one with you.

On the first floor you have an upward slope towards some really impressive marble sculptures. Do not fail to look beneath your feet as you ascend...the archaeological dig is visible and it’s a nice surprise which I fear many people miss.

Enjoy the excellent pieces and make your way to the top floor where you can watch a really informative film about the Parthenon. Interestingly, the top floor contains the exact number of columns and dimensions of the Parthenon with the frescos and sculptures from the original structure in the corresponding places.

Hope this helps.",March 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
You know it’s good...,"...as it’s the reason you came to Athens.

Nothing more to say other than carefully consider which side you enter from. The south slope involves a bit of hike up towards the entrance to the Parthenon. The alternative entrance is very steady.

Hit this up!,"This is Athens version of the Roman Forum....although not quite as impressive. However, do not let this put you off.

Pick a nice day of weather and immerse yourself in the vast grounds of the Agora.

Plenty to see and the majority is open to the public. Walk amongst the ruins and get your imagination running wild with what was and has been on this site.

Some great restaurants adjacent to the area as well.",March 2019,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Go on a Thursday.,"We visited the Benaki museum on a Thursday having settled in Plaka in the early afternoon.

The tourist information office informed us that the museum was free on a Thursday and open until midnight. Absolute result.

We wondered over around 6 o’clock. Quick tip....en-route, take in the changing of the guard at the Parliament House. Interesting to say the least.

Anyway, the museum set in a wonderful building. Unclear on who Benaki is but I guess at a collector of some sort.

The exhibits start off slow with a lot of pottery and trinkets from antiquity. First floor was a tad dull.

You move up to the second and third floor and it is much more invigorating. You have a collection of ceremonial clothing from surrounding empires, war remnants and information on the Greek nation in its current state.

Nice trip but go when it’s free.",March 2019,Benaki Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198714-Reviews-Benaki_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
This is why you come to Rome....,"I have visited The Forum a few times now. As a kid, it inspired an interest in history and as an adult it let me truly realise the might and grandeur of the Roman Empire.

For me, this should be number one on your list of things to do in the city.

The conservation effort is outstanding.

The various arches depicting famous battle scenes, the temples, the courthouse and the palatial remnants are a sight to behold.

Go here and be inspired...no matter what age you are.",June 2018,Roman Forum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d2154770-Reviews-Roman_Forum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Do you really need to read a review on this?,"I enjoy a long and honest review of places I’ve been to but this doesn’t need it.

My only advice, book in advance and don’t risk being unable to get in or having to be rushed around at the end of the day.

A true wonder of the world and an architect/engineering masterpiece.",June 2018,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Stag do (proven) idea....start your day here,"A mere 16 of us visited Amsterdam for a stag do back in April.

The city has many delights but a day of alcohol and fun needs a strong start to get people into the mood.

We chose to start our day at Glow Golf.

The venue is a little bit further out from the train station than you anticipate. However, let that deter you from a visit as it is well worth it.

You enter the building and stumble across the bar. Drinks aren’t cheap but you accept the price when you consider you are in a capital city and popular tourist destination.

You pay for your golf game and wander downstairs. You are met by a psychedelic setup which is pretty impressive. I had never done across anything like this before.

Each mini-golf hole has a different theme, an intriguing challenge and most importantly perhaps gets people enjoying themselves.

We finished our round of golf, not particularly happy with our scores, but in high spirits ready for a long day.

Highly recommend.",April 2018,Glow MiniGolf Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d3703587-Reviews-Glow_MiniGolf_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.0
An attraction but not for the paranormal enthusiast,"Everyone in the paranormal community knows about Winchester Mystery House. It is a place of intrigue which derived from the superstitious nature of Mrs Winchester - the heir to the arms manufacturer throne when Mr Winchester passed on - and the haunted spirits which died at the hands of the infamous rifle.

I was disappointed by the museum, being a paranormal nerd. It was much more commercial than anticipated and you definitely won’t be experiencing anything spooky on your visit. If you are going for that reason, then don’t bother.

However, the house itself was an absolute masterpiece. Quirky and enormous, it thrills any visitor - regardless of the original purpose of your visit.

We also visited on the day the Winchester film was released, a nice little touch.",February 2018,Winchester Mystery House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33020-d144412-Reviews-Winchester_Mystery_House-San_Jose_California.html,"San Jose, California",attractions,4.0,4.0
Interesting but not a showstopper,"Well, I liked it but I am not gushing about what was on display.

Don’t get me wrong, some excellent pieces from the Holy Roman And Austro-Hungarian empires (e.g. crown, orb and staff) but nothing to get too excited about.

Yes the gold items and ceremonial robes were impressive but when you compare the content and cost to other museums in Vienna, it really isn’t value for money.

Make your own mind up but for me, go other places first.",January 2019,Kaiserliche Schatzkammer Wien,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190454-d246451-Reviews-Kaiserliche_Schatzkammer_Wien-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",attractions,3.0,4.5
"Fun, informative and a little bit cheesy","A museum for the proletariat like me. I love my sophisticated visits but at heart I do enjoy a good interactive museum. If you are cut from the same cloth as me, get yourself here.

€20 is a tad steep on reflection but not a bad price for an hour of educational entertainment.

I won’t give much away on this one but the ending is a little strange to say the least. But, go in open minded, with a sense of fun and just enjoy a different experience.

No picture unfortunately....was enjoying it too much clearly.",January 2019,Time Travel Vienna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190454-d3316866-Reviews-Time_Travel_Vienna-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",attractions,4.0,4.5
My review doesn’t do it justice....I don’t have a thesaurus to hand.,"What a place!

You are first struck by the majestic nature of the building itself, but also it’s twin (the arts museum) which sits adjacent. An architectural site to behold.

You enter the museum and it is equally as impressive. The vastness of this area, along with the decor, immediately tickles your taste buds for the exhibits.

You start off on the bottom floor and take a counter clockwise journey through the timeline of earth and the evolution of our planet through to the day we as humans managed to stand up right and begin fashioning civilisation.

On completion of floor one, you are halfway through the visit and honestly can’t wait to get upstairs and take in further wonderments.

The second floor contains the best preserved and variant collection of animal taxidermy I have ever seen. Put it this way, it puts London’s natural history museum to shame - and that’s from a proud Englishman.

If in Vienna, you must go here. Non-negotiable. Adults and children alike will leave awestruck.

Pay the €12 and take your time to wander round this excellent museum.",January 2019,Natural History Museum (Naturhistorisches Museum),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190454-d191373-Reviews-Natural_History_Museum_Naturhistorisches_Museum-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",attractions,5.0,4.5
Don’t expect too much,"In all honesty, it was a let down. This is a monument rather than a visitor attraction.

As you walk in you are received by a promising exhibition on the restoration of the castle. Interesting read and you get a summary on the history of the site. Great.

You then proceed upstairs and quickly realise that this is not an impressive attraction. No further detail on the history of the building, it’s occupants or any events which took place there. For a site that has been occupied since the 10th century, you expect more.

The museum has no set route and we managed to get lost a number of times. At one point, we stumbled upon an exhibition which felt like a tourism pitch for St Petersburg. Confusing, given the limited information on the castle and Slovak people themselves. Very odd.

On to the treasury....nothing. Bare and a collection of plates.

Perhaps the castle lost much of its charm and treasures under the iron curtain but I would have just expected a little bit more from an attraction scoring 4 out of 5 on trip advisor.",January 2019,Bratislava Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274924-d276280-Reviews-Bratislava_Castle-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",attractions,2.0,4.0
