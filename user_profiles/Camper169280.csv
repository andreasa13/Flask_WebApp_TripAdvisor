Michelin Magic,"Seriously divine. Faultless. Superb food, superb service, superb ambience. Words escape me. It is that good. Inventive , creative and interesting menu.
My husband and I both loved it and they also made something that was acceptable to our ten year old son. A wonderful evening . So glad we went.

A must see!,"Wonderful to walk to the Acropolis in winter .
We have been here is summer and it is super hot and super crowded . It is an amazing experience in winter . A sunny winter day with the magnificence of the Parthenon against the blue sky. Our ten year old son enjoyed the history and the hiking !",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Hotel !,"This place is in our view the best place to stay in Athens . Perfectly positioned in historic Plaka. A short walk to the Acropolis . A wonderful view of the Acropolis from the rooftop breakfast . I have stayed many times and this place never disappoints. Swim in the outdoor pool in summer or the indoor pool in winter . The Aegeo Spa is so fantastic and relaxing : body wrap , massage and facial . Divine !",January 2020,Electra Palace Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228901-Reviews-Electra_Palace_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Disappointing Dionysos,"Great view , acceptable food and poor service.
This was recommended by our hotel .
Wish we had not gone .
While the night view of the Acropolis was truly beautiful and dramatic the service from our main waiter was surly.
This was a place that appeared to fawn over important locals and perhaps wished to dissuade tourists .
When we enquired about a children‚Äôs menu our waiter told us in a rude tone ‚Äú this is the menu‚Äù .
Such a sharp contrast from HYTRA where we had been the night before . HYTRA ( Michelin Star) went out of their way to accomodate our 10 year old son. Don‚Äôt go to Dionysos with a child . When it came time to leave we waited forever for the bill and eventually just went to the counter to pay.
This is a place that relies on a great view, does not want children and produces good enough (but not great food ). In the final analysis the service really let‚Äôs the place down . Wish we had gone elsewhere. I really wanted to like it. I couldn‚Äôt. I love Greece and I love Athens but Dionysos was truly disappointing.",January 2020,Dionysos Zonar's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1061815-Reviews-Dionysos_Zonar_s-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Swedish Classic,"Great menu, great food, great service !
A classic and fun place in Stockholm . Our waiter Alexander was delightful . The atmosphere eclectic . The food satisfied the foodie in us and was acceptable to our son who is not so flexible .

Michelin Star Degustation and Cocktail pairing,"We thoroughly enjoyed the creative and inventive menu along with the great matching cocktails.
It was also great that they were flexible enough to prepare something more simple ( a burger ) for our 10 year old son! A view of the acropolis , great food, great cocktails, great service. A winner !",January 2020,Hytra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3709153-Reviews-Hytra-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great for families,"We stayed here in July with our 10 year old son.
If you are travelling with kids this is the place to be in Denarau. We had an amazing dinner with a fire floor show and beautiful singing and guitar . Our dining table and chairs were in the water in the pool. The 3 of us had a wonderful time at this very special dinner experience. Our son did not complain about not having a screen.

Paradise on earth,"This resort is 10/10. From the time we were welcomed on the beach and throughout our stay we could not fault anything . The beach, the snorkeling , the food , the bures, and the staff are all truly divine. It‚Äôs wonderful that there are only 8 bures. It is not a mass produced holiday . There is a very warm and kind atmosphere. Our stay was cut short because our ten year old son had a health issue and all the staff were so so helpful to us. Sheung and Phillip and all the staff at Coconut beach you are truly beautiful people and it was a privilege to stay with you. We hope to come back and stay with you again and this time stay longer!",July 2019,Coconut Beach Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1185722-d8085460-Reviews-Coconut_Beach_Resort-Tavewa_Island_Yasawa_Islands.html,"Tavewa Island, Fiji",hotels,5.0,5.0
