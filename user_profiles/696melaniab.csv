Helt OK men inte bättre,"This time we decided to travel comfortably and booked Plus tickets. To be quite honest, for this type of flight... not worth it. One may sit in the front of the plane, but there is no extra legroom or better sits. It is true that you don't pay for the food, but it is not that great that it is worth the difference!
Everything works, but it is a little bit like some Scandinavian design: functional but plain!",February 2020,SAS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729142-Reviews-SAS,World,flights,3.0,3.5
Long lunch concept? Long wait it was!!,"Looking for a brunch on a Sunday we came to Hasselbackens ""long lunch"" concept. It sounded nice, like a long lunch back home in Spain! Well... not quite: the concept itself feels wrong. We were recommended to choose 1 or 2 courses each. We decided to start with one each... luckily we had a great conversation, as we waited a good 45 minutes to get the children waffles and our food. Then the amount of food we were served was just ridiculous, and unfortunately, quite tasteless! We ordered Hasselbacken potatoes with fish roe (a Swedish delicate that in this case tasted just butter). Two small potatoes served in a desert place does not feel right, neither for the price you pay, nor the concept ""long lunch""
Service was great and our waiter Alex was very pleasant and helpful, but it is very expensive and the quality does not meet the price.",March 2020,Scandic Hasselbacken,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189852-d1043384-Reviews-Scandic_Hasselbacken-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",restaurants,2.0,3.0
"Good location, average food","We ended up at this place for a late lunch our first day in Athens. We chose it because it was close to the hotel and it was away from the little traffic of the main street. It is a nice location overlooking some old monument, adding extra charm to the place. Obviously the great location brings enough people so they don't need to work on the service or the food. Food was average, but we order a salad that had at best 10 drops of olive oil. The products were fresh, but no dressing, salt nor taste. We were there in February and it was chilly. Every time we asked for something we felt we were bothering the waiters. Food was average, but service was poor. The location is still really nice, so maybe worth taking a coffee break instead of a meal.",February 2020,Diogenes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1880932-Reviews-Diogenes-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,3.0
"Great hotel, fantastic location and fantastic personnel!","When we left, my 7 year-old insisted on leaving a note on her and her sisters beds, for the staff to see it:”I ️Ava Hotel”. That summarizes my review. We were always met with a warm smile and very friendly, helpful personnel. Again, even my 10 and 7 year old daughters reflected often in how kind the staff were. We stayed for 1 week and loved our comfortable room with a great view over Acropolis to one side and Hadrian Arch and the Temple of Zeus to the other side. It was a great center point to explore Athens, comfortable, spacious rooms and quiet as it is in a small side street.
Breakfast was very decent, with a variety of international and local options.
The 4 of us stayed in a suite and it was comfortable, clean and spacious.
We booked initially for 3 nights but decided to stay in the same hotel for the rest of the week!
The best was definitely the charm of a small hotel with a perfect location and great staff both in the front desk and at breakfast. Very helpful, friendly, warm and helpful.
The perfect place to explore Athens and feel at home.",February 2020,AVA Hotel Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d529729-Reviews-AVA_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Cozy restaurant by the Acropolis,"You can’t get a meal closer to the Acropolis. We had a pleasant dinner while enjoying the evening view. Food is reasonably good (not fantastic, but as good or a bit better than other places we tried in the area). Desserts are homemade and the staff is really friendly. Prices are very reasonable, much better than the places down the street.",February 2020,Cave of Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3135266-Reviews-Cave_of_Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
An unique neighborhood in Athens,"I took an early “ish” morning walk with my daughter and it was a really nice surprise. Narrow streets, steep stairways, nice views of Athens... I can imagine it is not as nice to be up here during the hot, busy months in the summer, but we were mostly alone. Do not expect everything to be impecable! It is what it is: not washed and cleaned up to look nice for tourists. An old part of Athens with only a few houses in a fairly good shape. I personally enjoyed walking up and down the uneven stairs, walking sideways as my shoulders are broader than some passages. If you are in Plaka and Acropolis, it is worth taking an extra round here.",February 2020,Anafiotika,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d524609-Reviews-Anafiotika-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Everyone should see this once in a lifetime,"After many years I could finally make it to Athens and visit the Acropolis. It is absolutely breathtaking to be surrounded by so much history. All the mythological stories, the origin of theatre, medicine, philosophy, democracy!!
We visited in a sunny day in February and I am happy we did. Not too many people and not too hot. Greece is also with visiting in winter!",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Great food, cozy place, great service!","It would have felt a bit awkward to walk up the stairs if I wouldn’t have known where we were heading to. There are just discrete signs in the street a few meters off the most touristic streets in the area.
It was great to eat some really good food after a couple of nights feeling fooled at touristic restaurants claiming to be real Greek.
The restaurant was cozy, staff really great, polite and accommodating and food was amazingly good.
We are a family of 4 (kids are 7 and 10) and we all found our favorite dish. I had a risotto that was absolutely great but my favourite was the liver with spinach and orange sauce!!
The house wine was absolutely fine as well and we all enjoyed our dinner!
The price was also reasonable and this time worth it. We had starters and deserts and ended up paying as much as we had paid in the half-good touristic places the previous nights!
Can absolutely recommend it!",February 2020,Mani Mani,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d695929-Reviews-Mani_Mani-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Unusual place and unusual food,"We ended up here because of the bright decoration and unusual paintings. The place is certainly cool. Food was OK, not great but certainly better than in other places in Athens.
Avoid the upper floor as it is way too warm when the heating is on in winter time.
Service is not great and even though there were no many tables outside, it was quite slow, so make sure to order a drink, relax and enjoy the decor.",February 2020,Gypsy Jungle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d19350942-Reviews-Gypsy_Jungle-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Worth paying the entrance?,"We wanted to visit the stadium and went there to discover that there is a 5 € entrance fee to go and see from a closer perspective something that you see from the street.

Complete rip off! We got,"Complete rip off!
We got it recommended by the hotel: a place where both locals and tourists go. The location is beautiful and the restaurant looks fine.
We order some meat for the kids and it was totally fine. We wanted to taste the grilled octopus and a pasta with lobster.
The octopus was so dry it hardly could be cut!!! And the pasta... well, we got a couple of small bites and they were kind enough to place half a head of a lobster so it could be called tagliatelle with lobster. The taste was artificial and terrible, with no sign of lobster taste even there!! If you pay 35 € I certainly expect something better.

Nice atmosphere but not so great food,"We travelled there with children and stayed at the hotel. We had dinner there but food was unfortunately nothing special. Mostly greasy and not so well prepared, which you would expect for those prices.
The restaurant is really cool and staff very helpful and pleasant, but I would just say that food is mediocre.",June 2019,Bredaryds Wardshus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g4162241-d4105311-Reviews-Bredaryds_Wardshus-Bredaryd_Jonkoping_County.html,"Bredaryd, Sweden",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Too much focus on guns and shooting,"We were two families with 4 girls between 7 and 11 and the park was not the greatest for us. The park is really well done and it would even be pleasant to walk around if it wouldn't be for the smoke of the blank bullets and crackers. They kept asking if the guns people were carrying (including the visitors) were fake, which I hopefully said yes to every time. The youngest panicked when our train was ""assaulted"" and she thought we would all be shut. Even though the park is well done, for me it is too much focus on shutting and guns and therefore not really the way I would like to spend a day with my kids.",June 2019,High Chaparral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2541670-d3547127-Reviews-High_Chaparral-Kulltorp_Jonkoping_County.html,"Kulltorp, Sweden",attractions,3.0,4.0
An exotic place in the middle of the city,"When you enter the door you really feel like you are somewhere else. There is very much of a restaurant resort in Thailand. We went there for lunch with two small children and they loved it (so did we). The food selection is good and so was the food. Staff are nice and service minded and the exotic touches are entertaining while waiting for the food. Even a visit to the toilets can be very interesting, across bridges and jungle-like paths.",March 2019,Koh Phangan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189852-d776839-Reviews-Koh_Phangan-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great place to visit for adults and children,"The Vasa keeps updating itself and it is always a great experience to visit. This time we had a family visit and even though we missed the family guided visit, we had two super engaged children, really curious and interested to explore the different parts of the Museum.
Can really recommend a visit!

Quite expensive and prices do not correspond with quality,"I went there with my two daughters and we were placed in a corner behind the entrance door, which felt like it was the next best thing instead of asking us to leave...
Food was served quite fast but in metal trays that reminded me to serving trays you see in American movies' jails. Not really what I would expect when you pay over 200 SEK for a main course...
My food (fish) was not even good. I order cod and I could not even say what kind of fish it was, as it was so over-cooked it was hard and dry (a couple of pieces could be saved). I found quite a few fish-bones.
I mentioned it to the staff when I was asked about the food, but unfortunately they seemed to be quite uninterested and did not get any response. They kept away from us until we started to make a clear move that we were leaving.
I used to come here years ago and food and atmosphere were great. I wanted to show it to my daughters, but unfortunately the experience was not the same.
They are plenty of restaurants serving similar food in town and I would certainly recommend to try another one.",March 2019,Shanti Classic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189852-d786677-Reviews-Shanti_Classic-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Fantastic Family adventure,"I booked a one-hour trip with my two daughters (6 and 8 years old). It was the first time we did an excursion together since they started their riding lessons.
Everybody was really helpful and it felt safe. Unfortunately we took only a short excursion and the landscape is not great, but the horses were great and the staff kind, helpful and interested in their job.
Not only the horses seem healthy and well taken care of, but there are also plenty of other animals to look at and feed, and the place is really well taken care of and easy to access from Playa de Alcudia.
It is really worth a visit, even if you are travelling with small children and want to do something different.

Coolest place in town,"This is definitely one of my favourite places in Stockholm. Not only is the location amazing, close to the Old Town, right by the water and offering wonderful views of the city, but they also offer fantastic exhibitions and photography courses at all levels.

"Charming hotel, great service and personnel","The hotel is in a great location. I had a couple of days working in London and this was very close to where I had to be. I booked a single room with view to the street and I got a room in the corner of the building that was so small there was hardly room for the suitcase. The window had a frosted glass so you could not see outside. Not really the standard I was expecting. I was moved into another room of a normal size, but still not a street view as I had booked. I contacted the staff once again and I was told that I was ""upgraded"" to a double room with a street view. So, make sure of what you book when you book.

It is also quite unique that there is a great green area around the tower with several sculptures representing the ""rose of winds"" and the ""dolmens"".

You have to understand or try to imagine the importance of this place in ancient times, and the connection of the city with the sea.
