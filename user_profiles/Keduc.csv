"Wonderful stay, great room, great food","We stayed in the Tower room, right at the top of the castle for one night. Room was wonderfully themed and comfortable in all aspects. Only book this room if you want to climb around 6 flights of stairs though!
The restaurant meal was delicious. Friendly waiting staff too.

"Over-priced room, but great view, great staff and food","We stayed for one night in a castle view room at ¬£180 B and B.
The room had a great view but was tired. It smelt when we first entered and we had to air it for a while. Fixtures and fittings were tired, Eg. Fraying carpet and no grout in bathroom floor tiles. The shower had previous occupants hair in it. Would have expected more for ¬£180.
However, restaurant staff and food were both top notch. Dinner and breakfast were delicious. The waiter Macually was happy, pleasant and couldn‚Äôt help enough.

Another great visit üòÅ,"Our second stay here, this time in the King James Suite. We had an offer to include afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast (we paid a little extra to stop in the suite).
Afternoon tea was delicious and plentiful. Staff were helpful.
Dinner was superb and our raised dining area fantastic. Food was faultless as were the staff.
Breakfast the next day provided everything we wanted to eat. All table service re Covid, but we wanted for nothing.

Bathroom was large, modern and clean. We had everything we needed in the room and were comfortable in it. The continental breakfast was more than adequate and the room never packed full, which was good. Good fresh fruit options, lots of berries.

Superb customer service from Julio,"We are gold members and asked if we could check in a little early.

Julio was more than helpful and friendly and accommodating. We have stayed at so many Hilton hotels and he is a credit to this hotel.

Junior suite was great and we had a very comfortable stay. Cleanliness was excellent, bed was great, large and comfy.

Excellent and convenient,"We booked this trip online prior to our cruise stopping at Athens for the day, as we did not want a crowded coach tour trip losing time moving around as a large group. We also wanted to make our own choices about what to see. Also as there were 4 of us, it also made good economics based on the excursion costs from the cruise line.
What a great decision it was.
Visali was our driver, and although not a tour guide (we don‚Äôt think?), was friendly helpful and told us lots about the area, the sights and some history.
He met us at the cruise terminal holding a board with our names and we walked a couple of minutes to our large, comfortable minibus (just for us 4!). We had previously told the company where we wanted to go but I understand you can more or less set your own itinerary and timings if you want. We had also pre booked online tickets for the Acropolis which saved us a little bit of time when we got there, but the queues at the ticket offices were not as scary as the online information suggested (we visited around 4pm).
Visali took us where we wanted to go and gave us a spare mobile phone to use, to ring him when we had finished at an attraction and wanted to move on. He provided chilled bottled water too.
It was a brilliant day and I would not hesitate to recommend this company or Visali.",October 2019,Private Greece Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1924860-Reviews-Private_Greece_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0

"Slippy, with the risk of being trampled by donkeys","We decided it was a nice day to amble down the many steps, but what a mistake!
It was a difficult long walk avoiding ‚Äòherds‚Äô of donkeys, (either being sent down the steps unsupervised (to get back to the bottom to pick up more tourists) or walking up in groups of around 5/10 donkeys in a convoy) and the surface was very slippery. Completely unsuitable for anyone unfit or without trainers. The donkeys would walk where they liked, forcing everyone to hug the wall to avoid being trampled on!

Great location overall, opposite the bay. Lots of free parking.

The breakfast was up there with the best. We were first in the room and everything was perfect, gleaming and so clean.

Would stop by again but so many other Hard Rock Cafes to visit first!",December 2018,Hard Rock Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34345-d447634-Reviews-Hard_Rock_Cafe-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida.html,"Key West, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Fantastic beach, good service","We spent several hours here one afternoon. Crystal clear water and beautiful tropical sand.
Sun beds and umbrellas available as was a bar, restaurant and drinks service. A great beach club to visit.",December 2018,Copacabana Beach Bar & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147263-d2629675-Reviews-Copacabana_Beach_Bar_Grill-Bridgetown_Saint_Michael_Parish_Barbados.html,Barbados,restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Fun, scenic and rum!","We paid around $120 each for a trip around the island on this double decker train. The bottom carriages are enclosed, the top open air. The journey was around 2 hours through scenic countryside with sea views. The weather was beautiful and we needed the breeze we got.
When we first boarded and the train set off, it was rickety with much movement, we actually thought it would be an endurance test, however the more rum we had (included), the less the movement bothered us
We only had around 15 people in our carriage so plenty of room.
We would not do the trip again, but would definitely recommend to first time visitors.",December 2018,St. Kitts Scenic Railway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147374-d577699-Reviews-St_Kitts_Scenic_Railway-St_Kitts_St_Kitts_and_Nevis.html,St. Kitts,attractions,4.0,4.0
Fantastic day out,"A very worthwhile visit. We were given a talk with/about parrots, saw turtles, Sea lions, tortoises, fed sting ray.......
We had a guided tour of the park and visited the underwater viewing area where we saw lots of different types of fish.
There is a gift shop, cafe and it‚Äôs a 2 minute walk to the beach. Well worth a visit.",December 2018,Coral World Ocean Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g12012628-d313611-Reviews-Coral_World_Ocean_Park-Smith_Bay_East_End_St_Thomas_U_S_Virgin_Islands.html,St. Thomas,attractions,5.0,4.5
Location is great if you have no hire car,"Stayed for one night following a cruise. Hotel is huge and busy.
We arrived very early (check in wasn‚Äôt until 4pm), but managed to get our room earlier. Special thanks to Cynthia on the front desk for being so helpful.
Rooms are a bit tired but clean and adequate. There is not an in room safe.
The location is superb and lots of shopping, restaurants and bars are all within walking distance. For this reason alone we would stay again without hesitation.",December 2018,Embassy Suites by Hilton Fort Lauderdale 17th Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34227-d84451-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_by_Hilton_Fort_Lauderdale_17th_Street-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Flori.html,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.0
Very average,"We booked a couple of nights here mid cruises. We had one of the suites which had a patio over looking the pool. The first suite we were given had no sun whatsoever on the patio (it was the sun we were looking for, hence booking this room), but front desk staff moved us. When we first asked (by phone) we were told there was no other room available, but when we visited the front desk, there was one available. Pleased to say this one got sun from around noon (The Key West Suite).
Room was tired and furniture/carpets were worn and stained.
There was a large group of teenagers/young adults partying at the pool each day from early morning to evening. Not the hotel‚Äôs fault but it was non stop shouting and screeching.
The pool gets very little sun btw (Dec) so I wouldn‚Äôt book this hotel unless you want shade.
We wouldn‚Äôt stay again.",December 2018,Hilton Fort Lauderdale Marina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34227-d84471-Reviews-Hilton_Fort_Lauderdale_Marina-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",hotels,3.0,3.5
Great value for money. A cheap option for Gatwick parking,"We stayed here for one night before flying out and for half a day upon our return with 20 days parking. The cost was ¬£160 for all. I priced up an airport hotel with parking and for exactly the same deal and we would have paid over ¬£500 for an on site four star.
Little foxes is a cheap and cheerful option, very close to the airport with onsite parking (you leave your car key with the staff). The rooms are old and could do with updating, but the competitive price and parking costs are the attractions.
Rooms are clean, staff are helpful. Would definitely return based on cost alone.",December 2018,Gatwick Little Foxes Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187051-d615460-Reviews-Gatwick_Little_Foxes_Hotel-Crawley_West_Sussex_England.html,"Crawley, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
