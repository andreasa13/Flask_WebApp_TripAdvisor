Amazing Greece trip,"My experience with the greeking tour company was amazing! I was reluctant at first, as I’ve never booked a customized tour before, but I was blown away by their helpfulness, hospitality and attention to detail. The staff at the office were by my side always helping me with anything I ever wanted – while being polite and friendly too!

The guides were excellent too. They knew what they were taking about and it showed. I learned so many interesting facts and local tales that I think I have conversation starters at hand for the rest of my life!

Of course the places I visited were exquisite. We booked a custom 14 day trip visiting Athens, Delphi, Santorini and Crete! The landscapes, the beaches, the calmness -ahhhh take me back! I feel like I made the most out of every second on the country without having to sweat the small staff as everything was taken care of by Greeking. I cannot recommend them enough!!! All in all, it was a dream come true :)",August 2020,Greeking.me,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d9718747-Reviews-Greeking_me-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
