Third stay at City Circus,"Great hostel, with comfortable beds & clean bathrooms. Helpful friendly staff at reception, & the restaurant which provides an excellent & wholesome breakfast to fill up till mid-afternoon. The hostel has a kitchen for guests, a large common room, & a roof terrace for sunny days & warm evenings.There are some organised evening events in Zampano, the restaurant on the ground floor, & a daily walking tour which I've been told is good. A glass of house wine in the evening is a nice treat after a long day, & there's also cold drinks & snacks available to buy at reception.
It's easy to get there being a few minutes walk from Thiseio station, ten minutes walk from Monastiraki, & about a 20 minute walk from the airport bus at Sytagma Square.
The area has become more lively on the past three years as more shops, cafes, restaurants & bars have opened. I expect the area will become a little brighter & a tad noisier in future.
If you're skipping breakfast, try the bakery opposite for picnic items, & Coffee Island on the way to Thiseio station.
Looking forward to my next visit to City Circus, & hoping the restaurant's veggie dinner menu is expanded (please?).",March 2019,City Circus Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d3226035-Reviews-City_Circus_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
"So good, I've booked another stay...","This is the first time I've stayed in a private hostel, & was very impressed! I've booked to stay here again, which is the best recommendation can make.
I stayed in a comfortable clean shared room. The hostel also has a well equpped clean kitchen for guests, & friendly & helpful staff. There is a mini shop in the reception area selling snacks & drinks, including some unusual Greek microbrewery beers.
There is a restaurant below the hostel, where guests take breakfast in the morning. I enjoyed the Greek yoghurt & fresh fruit salad. There's also different breads & preserves.
The rooftop terrace has a view over the city rooftops, across to The Parthenon.
It's not in the nicest area, but very easy to get to the city centre, nearby rail station & The Parthenon.
There's a nice bakery opposite, which sells inexpensive pastries & lovely cake. It's also about 5 minutes walk from one of the Coffee Island coffee shops, that are considerably cheaper than anything similar in The UK.",January 2017,City Circus Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d3226035-Reviews-City_Circus_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0

"Great little coffee shops, also great tea!","I visited several Coffee Islands during my trip to Athens.
The coffee is very good, & very reasonably priced, at the equivalent of £1.60 for a flat white. This is £1 cheaper than a similar coffee in the UK.
There is also an excellent choice of tea, also very low priced.
I didn't try any, but there's also a wide range of cold drinks & snacks.

Please fix the heating & remind guests of room etiquette!,"Room maintenance issues included, my stay was not good due to the poor behaviour of another guest.
The room I was allocated was very untidy due to one person's luggage taking up a lot of space. Someone who arrived shortly after me, left immediately to request another room, as the last remaining bed was blocked by clutter & luggage. The owner of the luggage chose to spend several hours noisily packing during the night. She then has everyone woken up when the reception staff notified her of her taxi's arrival at 5am, followed by further packing & door slamming.
There were insufficient hooks to hang towels & jackets, as these were all taken. Perhaps these could be allocated with the beds, so that everyone can use one?
I felt sorry for the cleaner as the room was such a mess. The bathroom bin was overflowing with loo paper, as smeone had stuffed a large bag in the small bin, then dumped paper on top. There was discarded food left on top of the lockers, & packets on the stool. Perhaps a notice in several different languages reminding guests of room etiquete & hygeine might be damage limitation.
The staff are usually nice, & I like the location, but al of my stays here have been uncomfortably hot & noisy. My cleanliness rating is not due to lack of cleaning, but the other resident's abuse of common space.",January 2017,YHA London Central,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1066363-Reviews-YHA_London_Central-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
"NICE staff & room, BAD bathroom...","Lovely staff at this YHA, as usual.
There were good kitchen facilities, & the choice of food & drink in the cafe was also good.
Unfortunately, several things about my stay were disappointing.
I booked here, thinking it would be quieter & cheaper than the one near St. Pancras. However, there was an idiot singing loudly outside the hostel, until the early hours, & nearby building work started early in the morning. Aside from this, the bed was comfortable, & the room clean, with a good sized locker.
The bathroom was a let down as the shower was placed in such a position that it soaked the entire bathroom floor, whenever used. As there were four people in the room, the floor was constantly wet, so the bathroom unpleasant & unhygeinic to use. The corner shelf was useless, as it was at an angle, having detached from the wall fixing. This only became apparent when my washkit fell onto the wet floor.
I'd suggest anyone booking here asks for a room at the rear of the building.",June 2016,YHA London Central,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d1066363-Reviews-YHA_London_Central-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
"Good beer, good staff, & good pizza!","Great place to go for pizza & beer!
Much better than the usual run of the mill chain restaurants, as well as being a lot cheaper!
We went to see a band in the rather tiny basement, which was an added bonus, but it's worth traveling there from central London for the food & drink.

Lovely hotel in a pleasant & accessible Berlin district.,"This is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. All the staff are helpful, friendly, & speak English.
The room was bright, with a large walk-in wardrobe. It was quiet, despite overlooking the street. The beds and sofa were comfortable, & had a nice assortment of treats for our arrival.
Afternoon tea was very pleasant, with an excellent choice of loose & herbal teas. Breakfast was excellent.
Charlottenburg is close to the university, & the old Western Berlin CBD. It is within walking distance of nearby rail stations and bus stops, so the rest of the city is easily accessible. The hotel is in a residential area, but has some nice small shops, and plenty of good bars and restaurants nearby.

Good location for seeing Naples.,"The hotel is located through a gated courtyard, in a narrow Naples street, just off Via Toledo, so getting there was quite an experience. The area is a bit rundown, and one of the locals advised us to watch our belongings, though we didn't feel too unsafe, aside from crossing the roads.
It is well located, being in proximity to two rail stations on two different metro lines, as well as bus routes, so very easy to get to other parts of the city, museums, restaurant, shops etc. The funicular to Vomero is a short walk away.
We had a twin room with a small balcony overlooking the street, so could watch the crazy Neapolitan drivers. It was clean, & acceptable for the price range, though the bed was a little hard.
The hotel staff at the reception desk were really lovely and helpful. The only negative aspect was the woman preparing breakfast, who wouldn't let me have a coffee 15 minutes early, on the day we departed.

"Lovely host & great place to stay, I'd go there again...","The Blue Dolphin B&B is on the edge of Alghero, but being such a small town, is within easy walking distance of the old historic town, beach and twice weekly market which is great for local produce as well as bric a brac.
The accomodation itself is in two, two bedroomed apartments each with a balcony, with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
The views from the balcony overlook some olive groves which are pleasant.
The kitchen has basic facilities for making drinks and a microwave and fridge etc. There are lots of maps on the wall and guides available to browse through.
It's spotlessly clean as Roberto comes in to do this each day, and advise visitors on things to do in Alghero as well as other places to visit nearby.
The walk into town is nice if you like window shopping as the shops are spread out along the streets rather than situated in a shopping centre as with most places in the UK.
There are supermarkets nearby, one only a minute's walk away, and an excellent takaway pizzeria and some bars close, too.
I went out of the main tourist season, in December, and wore sandals for a few days as it was so warm and sunny, though other days were wet.
