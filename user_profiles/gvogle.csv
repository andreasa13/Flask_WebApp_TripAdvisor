Luxury safari trip,"We had a wonderful time at Elewana. All of the staff are so friendly and quick to respond to any request. Our guide Alex was great at pointing out all the animals, including finding a family with lion cubs we watched for over an hour. He enjoys his work and is completely respectful of the animals so although we were often very close to them they were always comfortable to carry on their life so we were able to enjoy watching their normal behavior. Simon and Jeremiah in the camp are the friendliest people that are so welcoming and eager to ensure we enjoyed our stay. Loved everything about our time here",January 2021,Elewana Sand River Masai Mara,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294209-d5062854-Reviews-Elewana_Sand_River_Masai_Mara-Maasai_Mara_National_Reserve_Rift_Valley_Province.html,"Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya",hotels,5.0,5.0
Crowded and expensive,"Used to love downtown Nashville, now Broadway feels like Bourbon st, crowds of drunks, extremely loud over priced bars.

Concert here was tops,"Lucky enough to get tickets for Josh Turner here, had done the tour a couple days earlier for the second time.

"Brunch, because Biscuit Love wait is crazy","Service is exceedingly slow, food is mediocre. Husband had the American breakfast and I had the hangover bowl.

Great location,"Nice sized rooms, great location in West End. Our room did not have a fridge which was the only thing we missed. Air conditioning works great, everything was very clean. Large common courtyard that had a great view and seating. The only issue was some guests can get a little noisy in the courtyard but while we were there the noisy ones all went to bed by 10:30 so not too bad. Free breakfast is nice, plenty of food but nothing special. Convenient walking to anything in West End, and half moon bay is right in front of you steps from the door.

Best food I had in Roatan,"Homemade tortellini with puttanesca sauce was so good, I wanted to lick my plate. Shared the chocolate salami for dessert, which was also delicious.

"Nicest staff ever, wonderful dives","My daughter (19) got her open water certification here and did another couple of fun dives. I went along on many of the dives to snorkel . I can’t imagine a nicer group of people to dive/snorkel with. Small groups, several times just my daughter, her instructor, and me and the boat captain. Alan, the boat captain snorkeled a couple of times with me and pointed out a lot of things I’d have missed. Paul the instructor was so kind and patient. Rino is fun to talk to about the island and the nudis he finds. If you want a small group dive with super nice people you can’t go wrong with Jackson’s",June 2019,Jackson's Dive Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g292019-d11716203-Reviews-Jackson_s_Dive_Center-Roatan_Bay_Islands.html,"Roatan, Honduras",attractions,5.0,5.0

"Good food, very nice staff","Went on the recommendation of our food tour guide. I don’t like seafood very much, but my daughter wanted octopus. Went with our servers suggestions and had salad, grilled octopus and fish salad. Honestly didn’t expect to like the fish salad although our sever insisted I order it when I said I didn’t really care for fish. He was right, so glad I listened. The vinaigrette on the fish was delicious, would order that again.

"Convenient location, noisy at night","The rooms are nice, very clean. Location is very close to the port and everything in Naxos town. Walk to the portera.

Wonderful day exploring the island,Nicolas is full of information about everything Naxos. The Byzantine churches we saw with him would never have been possible on our own and his knowledge of the history is interesting and makes it a fascinating tour. The shops in the small villages we visited were lovely.

Wonderful evening food tour of Naxos town,"I contacted Eleni and asked if she could do an evening food tour of Naxos town when we got off the ferry. She promptly responded with some questions about what we would like to do and the suggested a tour that sounded perfect and was exactly what I was looking for. Eleni was waiting at the hotel when we arrived as the ferry was a little later than scheduled. We first went to a wonderful cheese shop that is a must see in Naxos, we explored the Venetian castle, visited a more modern cheese shop and talked about the difference from the first one. Went for a lovely full dinner and then ended with a wine tasting at another must stop shop in Naxos. Eleni is sweet wonderful guide that feels like a friend not a guide by the end of the tour.

I’m so glad we left it up to him, everything was delicious. So good that when returned to Athens from the islands a few days later we ate our last meal in Athens here.

"Beautiful place, food is not so great","The first time we tried to go, the hostess rudely informed us they were completely booked that night and every night that week. Interestingly when we walked in with a Romanian guide who spoke the language we were able to get a reservation for the next night. It is a beautiful place, has traditional music and dancing for entertainment but the food was the least impressive we ate in our visit to Romania. Service was acceptable, waiter wasn't overly attentive but he wasn't rude and our food came faster than I expected based on other reviews.

We started with the meat appetizer, both of use chose the pork loin and dumplings (excellent) and I finished with the Hungarian dessert wine tasting. Only like the first one if those, but they were paired and presented nicely. Total bill was about $100.
