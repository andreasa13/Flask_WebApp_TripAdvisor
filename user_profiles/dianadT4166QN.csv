The ambiance is great,"We went here twice bcoz the food is amazing!! Reminded me back home to PH. The Lamb, Pork with leeks and Meatballs are delicious. And the homemade wine is also good, plus with live music! Totally recommend!",November 2019,Klimataria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d951245-Reviews-Klimataria-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Just a little bit pricey,"We had drinks and compare to nearby cafes and restaurants, they are expensive. We opted to try it anyway bcoz maybe they have something special about it, but sadly no.",November 2019,Cafe Amoroso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6697852-Reviews-Cafe_Amoroso-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,3.5
The Medieval Feeling,"Our Hotel has rooftop garden, and from there you can already see the beauty of Acropolis. Climbing there on foot is doable, the Main entrance is always queing,so we used the east side. There are moments that you can take pictures without photobombers, but overall it was still crowded despite the season. We would recommend for you to go very early and enjoy the beauty and peacefulness of the view!",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Unbelievably amazing!,"The last restaurant we went to and they bagged our 10/10.The Staffs are accomodating, suggested what drink to pair on our food. The food is ridiculously delicious, I had Pork Belly to die-for, and my boyfriend had Smoked Tuna!! The intimate-chill atmosphere paired with red wine is the best pre-birthday feeling ever. Please continue what you are doing because its really incredible. Thank you soooo much!
PS. We actually wanted to go here during our first night but kinda taken-back coz there's nobody, but pls don't be deceived.",November 2019,"Thes ""Greek Creative Cuisine""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d17837015-Reviews-Thes_Greek_Creative_Cuisine-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
