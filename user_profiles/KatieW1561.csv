Fantastic visit,We had a fantastic visit here. We paid for a tour through Trip Advisor and would defiantly recommend it if your knowledge like ours is limited. Not suitable for buggies as expected but we took our little girl in a baby backpack.,October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Lovely Museum,Great Museum and loved the ruins underneath the museum. Some staff were a little less child friendly however we put it down to the current circumstances. The restaurant was lovely and the staff and food amazing.,October 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
