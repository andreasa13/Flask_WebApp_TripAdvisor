Nice and enjoyable experience,"We visit this place every time we visit Athens ... directly from airport. Customer service office can keep your luggage safe during your visit. You can find quite good deals on many designer brands. Be aware that there are additional discounts either through a visitor card or relevant emails that you may receive (if you are a McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Athens subscriber).
Highly recommended to spend some time there (5-6 hours).
Enjoy :)",October 2019,McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562627-d2209583-Reviews-McArthurGlen_Designer_Outlet_Athens-Spata_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Spata, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
A Must place to visit when visiting Athens.,"The Acropolis of Athens is one of the most famous ancient archaeological sites in the world. Located on a limestone hill high above Athens, Greece.. It is currently under renovation to preserve this historic site but that cannot prevent you from visiting. You will not be disturb by the renovation.
It is a cultural UNESCO World Heritage site and home to several temples, the most famous of which is the Parthenon.
the Acropolis is located on the Attica plateau of Greece and includes four hills:
Likavitos Hill
Hill of the Nymphs
The Pynx Hill
Philapappos Hill

Good wine and finger food,"Very good choices of wine and nice finger food.
Just be aware that if you are looking for a place to have a “normal” dinner (I mean in quantity and choice) this is not the place. You go here for enjoying good wine accompanied with good choice of finger/tapas food.",October 2019,Vino Cultura,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190383-d2531063-Reviews-Vino_Cultura-Nicosia_Nicosia_District.html,"Nicosia, Cyprus",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Tasteful Pizza.. they know they are good and due to that you can realize an attitude,"The pizza is five star, the preparation was within the expected time. Nothing special about the place. The only drawback is the attitude of some of the waiters. They know they offer good food, they know it is a popular place and you can realize that they have an attitude. I was expecting a much friendly approach. food for thought Pizzeria Italiana - La Sardegna da Gino.
Other than that if you are looking for a traditional Italian pizza this is the place.",September 2019,Pizzeria Italiana La Sardegna Da Gino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190384-d1778666-Reviews-Pizzeria_Italiana_La_Sardegna_Da_Gino-Paphos_Paphos_District.html,"Paphos, Cyprus",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Spotless location, tasteful food, friendly staff","Not just a restaurant but a place to be. Food is wonderful and drinks are special. A must place to visit when you are in Paphos area. Be aware though that during the sunrise the place is getting really busy. No reservations can be made so get there on time if you do not want to wait. Nevertheless, waiting time is not that long. In case you are on a waiting queue you can enjoy one of their mouthful drinks while enjoying the amazing view.
We will definitely visit this place whenever we are n Paphos area.",September 2019,Oniro By the Sea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g776028-d2696132-Reviews-Oniro_By_the_Sea-Peyia_Paphos_District.html,"Peyia, Cyprus",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Let’s make a start with our dearest George Stavrou, the hotel’s F&B Manager who is not only a top professional but also a remarkable person. He went above and beyond to accommodate ALL our needs and requirements. He took care of every single tiny detail and the result was characterized by all our guest as SPECTACULAR !! Chef Pantelis along with his great team impressed everyone with a great variety of delicious gastronomical creations .
Mr. Andreas Mailazimis, the restaurant’s Maitre with his attention to detail ensured that the overall dining experience and buffet service were of the highest quality .
The waiters’ team (Simos, Korina Tasos, Ioannis, Nikos, Panayiotis and Giorgos) were more than helpful, pleasant and diligent. Anna from PR was exceptional, as she tirelessly stood by our side accommodating every single wish.

THANK YOU AZIA FOR AN UNFORGETTABLE STAY,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights this time and we have to admit that there is such an obvious progress in all aspects of the hotel's amenities, hospitality , services and staff response compared to last year .

We were very pleased and satisfied with the hotel's hospitality, especially with the staff which was extremely helpful , caring and prompt ; doing everything possible to accommodate our needs and requests.

Good location. Average overall hotel.,"The reason for giving 4 stars is due to the hotel’s location. It is located in the heart of Athens where all major attractions/shopping are within a walking distance. This is a big plus if you consider the regular strikes regarding transportation. Other than that there is nothing special about the hotel. Descent breakfast, clean rooms but not very spacious for a family of 3. The negative about the rooms is that they are not soundproof… You can clearly hear the conversations of the people from the adjacent rooms. If your are a light sleeper like me then you will definitely have a problem during your sleep. After reporting this issue the reception staff was very helpful and found a better room for us. Nevertheless, although the room was much better as far as the external noise is concern there was still a bit noisy. Another negative regarding the second room is that it was very hot and we couldn’t set the aircondition on cold air. As the staff explained the hot or cold air is centrally controlled for the entire hotel (it has to be either cold or hot!!!).
Anyway, don’t be discourage from my negative comments. I just wanted to point them out so you will be aware of what to expect. In my next visit to Athens I might choose to stay in this hotel again due to its perfect location.",March 2017,Electra Hotel Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228883-Reviews-Electra_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Excellent Hotel at a nice location,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. The rooms were clean, comfortable with nice beds and modern design. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast can satisfy all needs (healthy, British breakfast, etc.). Hotel location is very convenient since it is located within less than 5 minutes walk from the Kings Cross, St Pancras Underground and Train Station.
The only drawback is the hold amount that they reserve from your credit card for every night of your stay (I.e. For 6 nights they will hold GBP300). You will experience this unpleasant surprise only at the check-in time. This is something that it is not mentioned during your booking so be aware. In fact this is the only reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5 for this Hotel.",February 2017,Pullman London St Pancras Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d192068-Reviews-Pullman_London_St_Pancras_Hotel-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Excellent Service. Very professional and the same time very friendly. Highly recommended!,"We used Athens Taxi John's Yellow Cab not only for our transfer from and to the El. Venizelos airport but for our daily needs, as well. Our driver (G.G) was always prompt and professional. His driving was excellent and he always provided us with many hints and tips regarding Athens (what to visit, where to eat, etc.).
I definitely recommend Athens Taxi John's Yellow Cab for your driving needs. As far as my family and myself is concern we will certainly use this service in the future.
