Nice walk in the old city,"Plaka is the old part of Athens and is really picturesque.. From what our driver told us, it is really crowded with tourists in the Summer, however this was not the case when we visited, due to Corona virus of course. Small shops with interesting things for gifts. Ate ""mezedes"" (kind of Greek tapas) and drank ouzo at a very nice, very old place (sorry cant remember its name).",July 2020,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Spectacular,"A dont miss but visit early in the morning otherwise be prepared to get really hot! Spectacular panoramic view of the city and on a clear day you can even see the island of Egina! Parthenon, the main temple, is a marvel.",July 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great service. Highly recommended!,"We had arranged our visit from 2019.  Although we did have our reservations due to the current situation I am happy to say that everything went very well.  We arranged pick up from the airport with Private Greece Tours and a tour of the city.  Nikos Loukas, the owner, kept briefing us about the situation in Greece as our visit drew near which was really helpful.  Our driver, Dominick, wearing a mask and rubber gloves, picked us up on time.  He offered to give us masks, dettol and gloves but we were well organized!  Dominick gave us a wonderful tour of Athens.  He was very attentive, full of information and fun!  He dropped us off at Piraeus to take our ferry.  Great tour, very safe.  We highly recommend P.G.T. Tour Group!",July 2020,Private Greece Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1924860-Reviews-Private_Greece_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
