Acropolis - A Must see!,"Rain or Shine, it is safe & easy enough to climb! Preferably wear rubber sole strapped shoes, but we saw some in flip flops, and heels (but why)! Our ascent started at the South East entrance, it’s the better alternative for those that have concerns. We thought the paved incline to the entrance was more challenging, but after that it levels out. There is still more slopes, and steps, but stops along the way if needed. We descended down the path to the main entrance, and up or down is fine, but is more challenging, because of the gravel & dirt slopes. All that out of the way; it’s awe inspiring to visit!",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Impressive Archeological Museum,"There are many museums to choice from, but we decided to focus on the Acropolis Museum, and we are glad that we did. For one the architecture of the building is magnificent. It’s very well designed above an impressive out door excavation sight. Extraordinary views of the Acropolis, and chalk full of history and information. It’s definitely worth a couple hours out of a busy touring day :)",September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fab & Free tour of Athens,"Our first free walking tour was fabulous; we conveniently met at Hadrians Arch & it turned out to be a beautiful day in September. As more and more people arrived. I was wondering how in the world could this possibly turn out as a good experience. Well, the company had all under control, checked everyone in, and then split us into 3 groups with their own guide. Our guide was the ever entertaining Ariadnne (Princess), and delighted us with history, stories and entertainment for 2 1/2 hours. We toured around to all the high points in Athens, and also received advice for great places to eat & hangout. We really do highly recommend this tour ;)",September 2019,Athens Free Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d5257070-Reviews-Athens_Free_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Evening Tales,"We can’t say enough good about our Dark Ages tour in Rome. Our guide was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Our walk through the streets of Rome, passing points of interest would have gone unoticed during the day. So, we would definitely do it again!",August 2019,Rome by Night Walking Tour - Legends & Criminal Stories,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187791-d11449772-Rome_by_Night_Walking_Tour_Legends_Criminal_Stories-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",activities,5.0,4.5
Great times at Casa Rabbati,"My husband and I actually had a stay of two weeks in the lovely Michelangelo room. Just outside of our door was a glass covered ground well, that added to the beautiful Renaissance vibe. The room was plenty big for two, and had a futon seat for lounging, and the boiler added, was nice to have, to make tea & coffee. It was very convenient to have a small fridge for leftovers as well. Our lovely hostess, Marcella was a delight. She was always looking out for us, and did her best to make us comfortable. Everything was great, but the bed was extra firm and took some getting used too. The property is wonderful, just be prepared for neighboring noises if you are a light sleeper. The location can’t be beat; we walked everywhere, and even to the train station for a few day trips. Florence is amazing, people are friendly, and the food was awesome.",January 2019,Casa Rabatti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187895-d1452176-Reviews-Casa_Rabatti-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.5
Ski Adventure,"This ski run was great, but incredibly challenging compared to other designated blues.

"Great Stay, and Fabulous Location","We really loved our five night stay, and felt very welcomed checking in. Daria was a huge help with directions, and greeted us every evening with a genuine smile. The lobby, and breakfast room was styled with lovely alpine touches, and the superior continental breakfasts included choices for coffees, fruits, pastries and so much more. Our chosen room was very spacious, and had a small sofa, and a table with chairs for us to really settle in. The bed was very comfortably soft but not squishy, and the slippers were a nice touch. The town and Mountain views out the windows, and small balcony were prettiest standing, but allowed in plenty of light; day & night. The staff was so friendly, and accommodating, and the day host was super helpful at check out with directions. We would definately choose this hotel again, location was very central to everything, and bus stop are in front & a stones throw behind.",January 2019,Villa Alpina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g194745-d238077-Reviews-Villa_Alpina-Cortina_d_Ampezzo_Province_of_Belluno_Veneto.html,"Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Comfy, Convenient and Clean","Easy check in process, and friendly staff. We were happy with the cleanliness of our room, as well as the comfort of the bed. It was really nice to have a chair to relax, and lots of room to spread out",July 2018,Courtyard by Marriott Panama Metromall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294480-d2151432-Reviews-Courtyard_by_Marriott_Panama_Metromall-Panama_City_Panama_Province.html,"Panama City, Panama",hotels,4.0,4.0
