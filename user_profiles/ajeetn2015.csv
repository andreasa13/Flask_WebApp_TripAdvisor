Good franchisee restaurant,It is on the first floor with a narrow access from roadside shop. The ambience is ordinary. The food was reasonably priced and tasty. The place is recommended for Bengali cousine.,January 2020,Bhojohori Manna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d8469501-Reviews-Bhojohori_Manna-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Journey into india's colonial past,The garden is beautiful and well maintained. The lakes and waterbodies are pleasing to the eye.

Beautiful Temple,"It is a beautiful and popular tourist site. Crowded , on the banks of the river.

A Wasted Masterpiece,"The marble palace lies in a corner which is desolate with narrow approach roads and vehicle inaccessible bylanes. Photography is not allowed which prevents popularisation. It is managed by unfriendly staff who give you an impression of being unwelcome. The upkeep is also poor which does not leave a good impression on ones mind. But inspite of these none too informidable drawbacks, the museum is packed with artefacts par excellence. There is wooden work, the highlight amongst which is a one piece statue of Victoria. There is marble, china, glass and brass in three roomfulls. The walls are adorned with reputed painters' works and india's own raja raviverma also finds a place.
It is urgently necessary for the ASI to take this over and convert it into a well maintained museum of international attraction and repute.",January 2020,Marble Palace Kolkata,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304558-d325051-Reviews-Marble_Palace_Kolkata-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",attractions,4.0,4.0
Church or sun temple,"This is a highly recommend site in Cusco. It is a church Santo Domingo which proudly proclaims to have built itself after demolishing the most pious inca site that was a sun temple. The Christian component has beautiful paintings of Mary and Domingo which are pleasing to the eye.
The inca component, which is what is actually promoted on the tourist circuit, is negligible. One will see nothing here that one may not see on a tour of Machu Picchu and the sacred valley, which are purely Inka sites.
So go if one likes the same monotonous church paintings seen the world over. If you want the Quechua/Inka circuit, qorikancha is not the place to go.",October 2019,Qorikancha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294314-d316238-Reviews-Qorikancha-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html,"Cusco, Peru",attractions,2.0,4.5
Avoidable,"We saw this as it was close by. It has a 10 sol entrance, which is a complete waste of money. It is promoted together with Cusco cathdral as it has no value on its own. Avoid even if you have time on hand.",October 2019,San Blas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294314-d311932-Reviews-San_Blas-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html,"Cusco, Peru",attractions,2.0,4.5
Good meeting and socislising place,"Plaza de armaz is the most important landmark in Cusco. The central park has the statue of inka king presiding over the square. Here one gets a beautiful view of the surrounding hills on which Cusco is situated. Lord Jesus Christ looks down on you from one corner.
Cusco cathedral adorns one side and to its left is the church of triumph and natural history museum. Here one will see hotels, shops and hawkers galore.

Poor companion,"The ticket of 70 sols comes combined with that of sacsayhuaman. This decidedly is a joint promotion for poor tourist attractions which are avoidable. Apparently it is inca site for water temple.
There is a water spout. Does not make an enjoyable visit.",October 2019,Tambomachay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294314-d2318800-Reviews-Tambomachay-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html,"Cusco, Peru",attractions,2.0,4.0
A beautiful place,"One can understand this place only with a guide. Otherwise it is just stones and slides. Mayukmarca is the eye of the puma that is cusko. It gives a good photo.op of the city. Volcanic rocks hav created slides for children to enjoy. 'Echo point' was a good shouting match. Snake on the stone is the god of underworld. Burial ground, chairs of inka and khoya, toad god of the Quechua and the tunnel for water flow all have to be shown by an expert. In all a very good experience.",October 2019,Sacsayhuaman,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294314-d311726-Reviews-Sacsayhuaman-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html,"Cusco, Peru",attractions,4.0,4.5
Not upto the mark,"The facility provided a two room enclosure for 3 adults. It was spacious with a balcony which opened to the outside and gave adequate light and ventilation. The appliances were substandard. The TV cable would disengage spontaneously and required repeated plugging in. The fridge had low cooling. The toilet seat was loose. The electrical heater for food was also not good enough. These are just suggestions for the owner to improve upon.
On the plus side, the hotel is located close to bus, port, airport, malls for comfortable living.",May 2019,Pasiphae Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189417-d1765569-Reviews-Pasiphae_Hotel-Heraklion_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,3.0,3.5
Knossos sidekick,"The ticket is sold along with Knossos palace by paying just 1 euro extra. It is recommended to visit the place after seeing the palace. The museum is on 2 floors.

Minoan Citadel,"It's a euro 1.70 bus ride from Herakleion bus stop to the Knossos palace from bus station A by bus 2. The entry is euro 15. The site is beautifully explained on billboards with accurate directions for seeing. The ruins are of a palace with storage/garbage pits in beginning. The courtyard, walkway are nicely delineated.

Comfortable ride,"The ferry ride was at 9pm from Piraeus Athens, run by ANEK services. The ferry set out in time. The sea was compassionate , hence the ride was smooth and nothing untoward felt inside cabin. No motion sickness. The boat arrived in time at Herakleion at 6.30am. The disembarkation was uncomplicated and one could just walk out of the port. There is a complimentary coffee and juice from the company at the exit gate, something that most passengers are unaware and hence remains unutilized. There is also an ticket upgradation to cabin, available after the boat sails, whenever available.",May 2019,Crete Boats,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635861-d14015499-Reviews-Crete_Boats-Agia_Pelagia_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Comfortable stay,"The place is managed by 2 pleasant ladies, Georgia and S--. We were in an apartment overlooking metaxurghio circle and metro station. The sculpture of the fallen aviator was a pleasant companion. The room was spacious and comfortable. There was a fridge and toaster, but no microwave for heating. The bed for the third occupant was a children's bed, unfit for a six footer. Room service was deficient as the housekeeper made only one appearance in a 5 day stay.there are good restaurants, supermarket and money changers in vicinity.

Trip to the remote past,"The monument is huge. The entry door itself is imposing. As soon as one enters, one gets a mind numbing view of the Parthenon. It spreads east.west. only the external pillars remain, the internal temple of Athena is completely destroyed.

On top of Athens,"Mt lycabettus deserves a visit. Get down at evangelismos metro station and walk. Right from the station one's walk is slow uphill. It is best to take the most trodden path rather than the funicular, as the treasures reveal slowly. The view from the top is stupendous.
