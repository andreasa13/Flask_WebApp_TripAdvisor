Beautiful Palace,It was a lovely day out taking the tube from Center of the city. Beautiful place and good audio explanation. Try to book your ticket before you get there so you know your entry time for the Palace. Don't carry big backpack or otherwise be prepared to queue to hand it in for safe keeping.,July 2019,Schönbrunn Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190454-d194165-Reviews-Schonbrunn_Palace-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",attractions,4.0,4.5
Good all round,"Good all round including the bill! We were lucky to have the table booked 30 minutes before hand on a Wednesday evening; Lovely food; service is ok, nothing extraordinary though.

Friendly and knowledgeable,"By reaching the railway station, we found no official information to explain how we can tour the palaces located in the mountain! Bruno approached us explained ALL options till I asked what he can offer, no hard sale!! The three of use decided to have his service and that is the best decision! He is knowledgeable about the region, passionate about his work, courteous and keen to help! Having spent the day with him, he dropped us in a local resturant at our request, parked the car, walked us to the resturant, explained all the details about the food, how to get the train station to return to Lisbon etc. etc. Nothing was too much trouble! He gave us a very pleasant day!

A good hotel,"This is a good hotel with good facilities and friendly staff. Breakfast is good. The location is convenient for tube and taxi ride to Plaka etc. the Center only costs €5.

Disaster Service,"On arrival of this West Yellowstone Self Catering Studios and Cabins, within the first encounter with the owner, Sessel Sagorin, we were threatened by him and told he will not provide the services he has charged and agreed. Police was involved and we lost all the money we paid! Having re-arranged our tour with the help of local police, local newspaper editor and many others, we found out he is known to the area for his temper, rudeness and fraud. Unfortunately it seems nobody could stop him from trading!!

Without going into great details, all we can advice people is NOT to use this company at all!!

It puts shame on this great country, world class travel destination and its friendly people!",July 2015,Bundu Bashers Private Day Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d2294983-Reviews-Bundu_Bashers_Private_Day_Tours-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,1.0,2.0
