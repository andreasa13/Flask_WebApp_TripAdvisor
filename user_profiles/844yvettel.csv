A southern Rhodian treasure,"• THIS PLACE •

Mea Terra, Rhodes. Everyday I get more and more impressed by the southern part of Rhodes as we explore this fairly unknown part of the island for two weeks.

This area is like a relaxed jazz tune. No crowds, down to earth people and - filoxenia.

You find Mea Terra off the beaten Rhodian track, where you can submerge yourself in, what feels like, an eternal blue sea where the sky mirror itself in the crystal clear Mediterranean Sea.

The design of this unique beach restaurant is a natural concept, referring back to “terra”, earth, with wood, rotting lamps, and a white colourscheme. The senses comes fully alive and it is above all a very relaxed place, where you find your inner calm, joy and focus in a stunning setting!

There is a sense of openness and freedom as you walk down the stairs from the parking lot ( free of charge ) and the sea opens up and the lounge music fills the air.

Founders focus on good quality food. The service is excellent and we will for sure come back, hopefully bringing friends with us.

I was there with my kids, aged 11 & 14 and we all loved it. It is also highly attractive for couples and groups of friends. Sun-beds with parasol are 6 euros and it comes with complimentary water.

• FILOXENIA • is Greek and means hospitality. You can feel it at Mea Terra.",July 2019,Mea Terra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1568712-d16856461-Reviews-Mea_Terra-Lachania_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Perfect place at Elli Beach.,"We spent ten days in June, by Baia Seaside. We came around 11 in the morning, rented sunbeds+parasol =5 euros per person for a whole day. The sunbeds directly next to the sea is 10 euros.

I had my frappé, 2,90 euros, by my sunbed. Perfect. The staff is very friendly and works efficiently.

We always had lunch by the restaurant. You can however eat by the sunbeds too. We liked the break though, from all that sunbathing ;-)

Everything we ate was very tasty and the food arrived reasonably fast. I had fresh white wine every day and it was very good.

The view is beautiful. The location directly by the sea is perfect.

We lived at Hibiscus hotel, which is very close by.

The beach has small pebbles, becomes deep quickly and is therefore not a place I recommend for families with toddlers.

I was there with my kids , aged 11 and 14, and they loved it. Didn’t want to go anywhere else.

I would definitely go there if in Rhodes town.",June 2019,Baia Seaside Rhodes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635613-d8272027-Reviews-Baia_Seaside_Rhodes-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
An urban oasis,"A neat and discrete restaurant that draws your attention because it looks so peaceful and gorgeous.

White rotting lamps, cute white lightning, green and soft white table cloths, soft green chairs and a very calm and kind atmosphere. That’s the setting.

The prices are very reasonable and the menu is extensive. All your Greek favourites are there and they are presented in a fresh way. We had Greek salad with a mixed plate of dips with grilled pita bread. White wine. All impeccable! We will come back!",June 2019,Proavlio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635613-d12810438-Reviews-Proavlio-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing Acropolis,"I visited the Acropolis in April, on a rainy and windy day, but that didn’t matter. It was majestic and impressive. It’s totally incomprehensible to realize the age of Acropolis and the development of an early European civilization there. I ponder on democracy, theatre, literature, rhetorics and philosophy.

Count on spending 1-2 hours up there.

I was especially fascinated by the amphithéâtre.

Must come back!",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Greek, delicious breakfast.","I spent 3 nights at the hotel and could enjoy the view of Acropolis from the roof top bar, a comfortable bed, and a very delicious Greek breakfast. There was the thick and creamy yoghurt with tasty honey, oranges to make juice, spinach pie, macaroni pie, some sweet, Greek cakes, olives, feta cheese and much more!

The staff at the hotel is very friendly and accommodating.

There is a market close by, where I bought herbs for cooking and making tea. I also bought walnuts, olive oil and honey there.

The Monastiraki metro is not too far away, on walking distance. Good when you want to go to the airport. The Monastiraki square, however, is not a cosy place......

Walk further to the old town and Acropolis. Heard the Acropolis museum is astounding! That will be next time.

It is true that Athens is worn down and looks “tired” with all graffiti. I feel for the Greeks, post and present economical crisis.

Anyhow, Greece is one of my favourite places on earth!",April 2019,Fresh Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d455633-Reviews-Fresh_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Ambiance, delicious food and excellent service.","Agora is a must if you are in Athens. The food is so tasty and there is a mix of flavours and textures, both typically Greek and more international. Just simply book a table and go there!",April 2019,Agora Restaurant-Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d695881-Reviews-Agora_Restaurant_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Wonderful setting, great potential, mediocre food.",The staff was super nice and the whole concept is wonderful. I think you need to take the feedback about the empanadas a bit more seriously. Feedback is only there to make you EVEN BETTER . They are a bit “ doughy “. Elaborate a bit more on the recipe and they will reach the stars! The Kivik lemonade with strawberries and mint was extraordinary ! So was the rose lemonade ! The Sweet potato fries were perfect for an “ after beach” snack. We will come back! Have a successful summer !!!,May 2018,Lindas Fingermat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g676531-d10731209-Reviews-Lindas_Fingermat-Skanor_Skane_County.html,"Skanor, Sweden",restaurants,3.0,4.0
