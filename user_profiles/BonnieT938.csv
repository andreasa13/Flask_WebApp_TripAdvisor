Amazing!,I had to pinch myself to think that I was lucky enough to spend the morning touring the Acropolis. A dream come true!

Beautifully designed museum,"We toured the Acropolis one morning and the Acropolis Museum the following afternoon. We had a guide for the Acropolis and he was so good, we wished we had also hired him to guide us through the museum. With that said the museum is beautiful and visitor friendly.",March 2020,Skip the Line: Athens New Acropolis Museum Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12835132-Skip_the_Line_Athens_New_Acropolis_Museum_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
"Athens tour guide, Angelos Kokkaliaris","My husband, sisters-in-law and I (all over 70) had the best morning with Angelos Kokkaliaris at the Acropolis last week! We only wished that we had also signed up for him to guide us through the Acropolis Museum, which we enjoyed on our own, but we would have enjoyed much more with Angelosâ€™s guidance and knowledge. After our tour Angelos guided us to a wonderful close by Greek restaurant. In the day of Coronavirus we bumped elbows and said our goodbyes. Wish he could have joined us for lunch!",March 2020,Guide me in Greece Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d11785389-Reviews-Guide_me_in_Greece_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Percy,We had an overnight at the Hilton Newark airport hotel and we wanted to mention Percy who was our delightful shuttle driver! We wished our drive could have been longer!

A wonderful overview of Helsinki,My group of 5 friends joined 2 others on a beautiful day in Helsinki. Jari guided us throughout the city and gave us great information on both Helsinki and Finland. We couldn't have asked for more and we felt it was a great introduction to seeing this lovely city.,July 2019,HELtours - Helsinki Bike Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189934-d6721630-Reviews-HELtours_Helsinki_Bike_Tours-Helsinki_Uusimaa.html,"Helsinki, Finland",attractions,5.0,5.0
