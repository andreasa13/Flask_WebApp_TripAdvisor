like a stationary food truck but the food is delicious,"Chesk√†s was recommended for people with IBS like me. It offers pizza with a sweet potato crust which is low FODMAP. We went expecting a real restaurant but this is more a grouping of three little food stands: pizza, sushi and tacos. A couple of these stands have a counter with a few chairs. Cheskas has one small table and two chairs. The pizzas were great.",November 2019,Cheska's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d16653845-Reviews-Cheska_s-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Every piece is a masterpiece... and no crowd!,"At the northern end of Manhattan, there is the beautiful Tryon park. Walk through this, gazing across the river to the cliffs of New Jersey and you reach The Cloisters. The collection gathers archetypical pieces from ruined monasteries and churches. Each can be seen up close, much better than in original settings. As an extra perk, this museum has no crowds, which is particularly enjoyable compared to the rest of the Met. I have visited dozens of European monasteries and yet I found this fascinating.",November 2019,The Met Cloisters,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d106609-Reviews-The_Met_Cloisters-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Beautiful natural site, lovely monastery",The road into the gorge from the north is a scary drive with hairpin turns but the road is paved. We used the south road to exit the gorge and ths was much easier going. The parking near the Ancient Gortys is tiny (less than ten cars) but we managed to fins a spot and there were a few free when we left as well. The Prodomou monastery was closed when we got there but the Folisofou monastery is well worth the trip. It is lovely and covered with flowers and friendly cats. It provides water.,September 2019,Lousios Gorge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g970271-d4875837-Reviews-Lousios_Gorge-Dimitsana_Arkadia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Dimitsana, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
a rusted boat,I really don't see the appeal. It is a rusted boat! Not particularly old or historical. Let's face it: there is not much to see or do in Githio. It is just a pleasant and convenient central point to explore Mistra and the mani peninsula.,September 2019,Shipwreck Dimitrios,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315842-d9732425-Reviews-Shipwreck_Dimitrios-Gytheio_Laconia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Gytheio, Greece",attractions,1.0,4.5
Acropolis at 8:00,"We had bought a combined ticket for seven archeological sites of Athens the day before so we did not need to buy it on the day of the visit. Also, we entered through the wesr entrance rather than the sout-east entrance. In this way, we got to access the top of the Acropolis first and on'y saw the theater on the way down. In this way, we were on the site early. We were by no means alone but, aside from the portico, the place was not crowded. We also avoided the worst of the heat. It was a great visit.",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
