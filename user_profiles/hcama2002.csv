Truly scrumptious,I found the eatery by chance and selected dishes based on descriptions. So very pleased with quality of food. Portions were large and I have enough left for 2 more meals. Will definitely order from them again.

Excellent value Sunday Roast,Have discovered this place during the CoVid lockdown and have visited several times since. Have used their Sunday lunch takeaway a couple of times and it’s truly scrumptious. Hence the review. Comes v well packed and can be easily reheated at home. Very generous portions too. Will return well many more times.

Huge portions oozing quality,"So impressed with the quality and portion sizes of takeaways. I live 15 min drive away and the food is well packed and remains warm. I have a good appetite but am almost full after eating half their Christmas sandwich or their massive Christmas Yorkshire pudding wrap with all the trimmings. Their chunky chips are superb. Today I requested salad instead of chips with my sausage, bacon, Brie and cranberry panini and the salad was beautifully packed in a large box. Was surprised to find a generous amount of coleslaw too. Cannot recommend this place enough. I have always pre-ordered but still wait about 5-10 mins whilst my food is freshly packed. I get priority in the queue. Their huge and delicious wedge of Yorkshire curd tart is recommended too. Excellent value for me. Travelling there is a good excuse to take my car for a run when it remains on my drive these days during CoVid.",December 2020,Bolster Moor Coffee Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190748-d2552396-Reviews-Bolster_Moor_Coffee_Shop-Huddersfield_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Excellent food and service.,"Excellent food and service. They serve Chicken and pork souvlaki, Greek and other salads and cubed pieces of chicken or pork freshly grilled on a BBQ. Enjoyed my chicken soulavki so much that I ordered a second one even though I was full. Wish I had found the place sooner. It is situated v close to the exit of the Acropoli metro station.

Must see this before going to Acropolis,This is a must see especially with a guide as it puts the ruins on Acropolis in perspective. Initially I was not going there but am so pleased that I changed my mind. I am a person who does not like museums but the tour guide’s commentary put so much in perspective before going to Acropolis. Beautiful views of the Parthenon from there too. The architect of the museum has tried to reproduce many elements of the Parthenon.

Just perfect for solo lady traveller,"Cannot praise this hotel enough. Just off the tourist track situated between 2 metro stations - Syncgrou-fix and Acropolis. The former has some steps at the end so I shall avoid using again on my return. The latter has a lift and elevator from ground level.

All the hotel staff speak good English and are v welcoming and helpful. Room was v clean and exceedingly comfortable. V little traffic noise even though it is on a v busy main road. Breakfast was excellent with a lot of selection. Lots of restaurants around and a lovely bakery across the road for light bites. Only issue with the place if I had to find a fault is that there are steps to get to reception and then to the elevator. If you are lucky receptionist is helpful.

Went there based on reviews,"Went there based on reviews put on TripAdvisor on my first evening in Athens. Cannot fault the service. As I told the waitress that I was v hungry, she recommended that I try the lamb kleftiko which was indeed a v large portion. Huge lamb shank slow cooked with loads of potatoes, cheese and some red peppers. Thank God I did not order bread as recommended by the waitress and I would have stuffed myself with loads of carbs. The restaurant gives a local drink similar to oozo and some little toasts on the house before the meal and another less strong but slightly sweet alcoholic drink with Greek yoghurt and a bit of fruit on top. Had I known that I would have not ordered the baklava. It was good too.

Authentic South Indian food with horrible service,Cannot fault the food at all. Absolutely amazing. Very authentic South Indian food. However service was absolutely appalling. There was just 1 waitress who had a child tagging along behind her. We had a booking for 12 (incl 3 below 10 yrs). Got served after 1.5-2 hours. One person got the main before the starter although they insisted what appeared as a main was indeed a starter. The bill was wrong. They had undercharged us by a large amount with items missing on the bill. However we paid what we owed them. Will not go again as service was absolutely horrible. Kids wanted to leave after an hour when there was no sign of food. Many popular soft drinks were not available again.

So pleased they have got Good Food award. Very well deserved,"I am surprised to read 3 unfavourable reviews. I have not used the take away service and always sit there and eat. Always take a detour if I am travelled west on M62 back home or if I am in Batley. The place is run by a young Tamil couple who offer the most extensive menu. Not sure how they do it as all dishes always taste as if they are freshly cooked. I always have either the masala dosa or the chicken tikka dosa or their chilli chicken dosa but have tried some curries that friends have ordered. Their rotis are phulkas and come extremely hot. Some Indian dishes can be v oily if you want the authentic version.

I am from India which has diversity of food and can undeniably say that this family does justice to Indian food. Great value. Will continue to visit them. So pleased that they have also been recently awarded the Good Food Award.

Great tour and excellent customer service from the Back Office,"Excellent communications and support from the back office soon after I booked the flight and when I missed a pick up time at an attraction. The places you see are exemplary. We were also taken to a beautiful Bulgarian church which was not on the itenary and I am not sure if as a result of this trip the duration at the spice market was reduced.

I strongly recommend the spice market over the grand bazaar in Istanbul as the former is smaller and vendors are more than willing to sell smaller quantities of all food products. Generally the smallest box for Turkish delight is 500 g but here they will pack stuff in smaller quantities in plastic bags. Same with spices. You can buy 50-100g amounts compared to 250 g in Grand Bazaar. 1g contains of saffron are also available here.

What I really liked about this tour company over another I had used on the previous day is that they give you headphones and the tour guide actually comes with you to places of interest and gives a running commentary rather than getting a short commentary outside the attraction and free time to visit.

I highly recommend the tour and the tour company.",September 2019,"Bosphorus Full Day Tour: Bosphorus Cruise, Uskudar and Dolmabahce Palace",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g293974-d11452618-Bosphorus_Full_Day_Tour_Bosphorus_Cruise_Uskudar_and_Dolmabahce_Palace-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",activities,5.0,4.5
Loved this so much more than the Grand Bazaar,This place is a smaller version of the Grand bazaar and here the stall holders are happy to sell portion of spices and baklava too unlike the Grand bazaar where the smallest sized box if you were lucky is 259g - else 500g is the norm and 250g is minimum for spices. Fortunately in the spice market the traders are more than willing to sell smaller sized portions albeit not in fancy boxes. The spice market is v close to area where boat trips to Golden Horn and Bosphorus start. It is well served by the tram network too.

The famous Grand Bazaar and Spice markets are about 10-15 min walk away. Most of the area is pedestrianised.

Amazing service and amazing service,"How I wish I had discovered it on the very first night I got here. Found it accidentally on day 2 and although I was full and did not want a full meal, the dishes on the menu caught my attention and the host suggested I sample just a “small” starter made with aubergine called Imam Bayildi. The waitress too was so kind and hospitable. As usual not only did I get a free Turkish naan but had the most delicious tzasitki to go with it. My starter was amazing but the size of a main course. It was scrumptious and I promised the staff I would return again and I did. I was so hooked by the quality, quantity and customer service. Today based on the host’s recommendation I tried beef Guvec which was a Turkish stew on a hot casserole dish covered with an ornate Turkish container. The flavours did not disappoint.

Slow service and stray cats spoiling my dinner,"Went in after being greeted v warmly. At first I was seated near someone smoking a cigar and when asked to be moved to a non- smoking area I was given a lovely and comfortable seat. Unfortunately, even though there was a large non-smoking sign next to me, someone who appeared to be friends with the servers walked in and I could see from above that he wanted to light a cigarette. Guess what? He was sent upstairs and he lit his cigarette whilst still standing close to me. When I pointed to the non- smoking sign he looked bemused as if what is wrong with smoking. I appreciate that people smoke in restaurants in this country but would have thought that if a zone was marked non-smoking then it would be smoke free. I started feeling uncomfortable by now.

Then a stray cat wanders in as there are many stray cats and dogs in the city. Perched at a height waiting for my food to show up, I could see the Brits and Japanese loving this cat. Then soon after my sea bass was served, it understandingly did not want to budge and was trying to jump up to my seat. Being a non- cat lover I was trying to shoo it off but a waiter kindly came up to get rid of the cat. He even sat on stairs to block it. Soon after he moved the cat came back and poor chap came to my rescue again.

The sea bass was also quite bony and as you can imagine that by now I just wanted to pay and get out.

Due to this experience I am giving it a poor score but the food was not outstanding either. Sorry for giving a low score.",September 2019,Mitani restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d2055746-Reviews-Mitani_restaurant-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,2.0,5.0
Great friendly and exceedingly helpful family run hotel,"I found this hotel based on reviews and proximity to the tourist sites and it is absolutely perfect for my needs- single woman traveller. It’s so central that a wall of Kopyaki palace faces its entrance although the entrance to the palace is less than 5 minutes away depending on tired your feet are! The view of Hagia Sophia from its roof terrace is the best I have managed to get. As all the tourist attractions are in exceedingly close proximity together you do not need to worry about transport. However the tram stops in the square with all tourist site so no more than a 10 min walk.

This family run hotel wants you to feel at home when you are their guest. The welcome I got when I arrived by an airport shuttle was so warm and friendly and two staff genuinely wanted to help me and I felt v bad after I politely refused as the bag was light.

There are some very good and reasonably priced restaurants almost round the corner.

The breakfast buffet was excellent and v good quality. It is suitable for people of all dietary types including vegans. The Turkish sausage and various cheeses are superb. Can’t wait to have them again tomorrow morning.

I will not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will return back if I come with friends or family who have not been to Turkey.

My room although in the basement has a double and single bed with a lovely wardrobe and dressing table. The bathroom is v modern with a walk-in rain shower that can be operated as a rain shower or hand shower. They provide lots of toiletries too. There is a mini bar in the room and a hair dryer in the bathroom. There is a TV and comfy chair. I have seen a guest leaving laundry at reception but I have not used it as I am here for a short break only.

Amazing food with amazing service,"One of my favourite Indian restaurants in UK and, the food reminds me of growing up in Mumbai. Absolutely authentic Indian food where the spices are used to add flavour and food is not spicy and run off the mill. Had been there a few months ago. Just had a super lunch at a friend’s party where a large selection of food was pre-ordered and served. We were not rushed and no request is too small. Sunita and the rest of the “crew” ensure that the guests have a great time. They serve with an authentic smile and I am looking forward to returning back next weekend.

Great day out for people of all ages,"I enjoy going there periodically and one never knows what to expect with visiting artists. Took a visitor on a fleeting visit today and the visiting artist had mixed styles. I remembered seeing more Henry Moore (HM) sculptures closer to the main entrance but struggled to see them today. Was disappointed to find aircraft engine on the first lawn. Would have been nicer to have a HM sculpture closer. Fortunately on our drive out, we could see a few HM sculptures at a distance. Fortunately the beauty of the location is always breathtaking and serene.",August 2019,Yorkshire Sculpture Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190729-d212016-Reviews-Yorkshire_Sculpture_Park-Wakefield_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Best place to buy traditional Yorkshire baked goods,"I love this bakery that is situated on the main cobbled street with bespoke shops, close to the Bronte Parsonage in Haworth. The quality of their goods has been consistent at least for last 14 years whilst I have lived in Yorkshire. I enjoy their fat rascals ( yes, this is what they are called- similar to a large cookie but not too sweet) and the Yorkshire curd tart. If they had a branch in Huddersfield where I live, I would go and treat myself often and buy their freshly made products as gifts from Yorkshire. They have a cafe at the back too that I have never visited. I strongly recommend all tourists to Howarth to visit this bakery. It’s on the right hand side as you walk down the cobbled street at the Parsonage end. I can not recommend it enough. Fortunately I found the packaging of my half eaten “rascal “ to remember its name to review it here.",August 2019,Villette Coffee House and Bakery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186409-d6028611-Reviews-Villette_Coffee_House_and_Bakery-Haworth_Keighley_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Haworth, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Always v popular with tourists,Took my old English school teacher visiting from India over there. She found it interesting. Each room has descriptions on frames and it’s worth reading. There are v helpful young volunteers and museum assistants at both levels and they are exceedingly knowledgeable. You MUST remember to ask one of them about paper arrows on the wall in the children’s nursery. They will guide you on how to see v faint sketches ( which is beautiful graffiti drawn on walls by the children). It is no explained about this. We were v disappointed with the special light show in the basement at special times in the day. We would have missed it as I do not remember reading any posters for the same. Learnt about it as I was chatting with a young assistant. There are costumes that both adults and kids can wear and take personal photos too. There is a pay and display car park v close to the parsonage and a ramp to get there easily. There are no public toilets in the parsonage which is disappointing due to lack of space. Howarth is a lovely town with speciality shops and eateries on a v steep hill. I suggest that if anyone has mobility issues they park on top and walk down hill and let a fit person walk back to the car whilst others wait down the hill on the at the end of shops or outside the garden to be picked up. There is a bakery that sells proper Yorkshire specialities. Everything is exceptional especially their Yorkshire curd tarts and fat rascals that are not available easily elsewhere (especially outside Yorkshire).,August 2019,Bronte Parsonage Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186409-d211789-Reviews-Bronte_Parsonage_Museum-Haworth_Keighley_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Haworth, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Breathtakingly beautiful,"I live in West Yorkshire and regularly take visitors there. You only pay £10 car parking fees and you can park multiple times in any of the 3 car parks on site. Thanks to the heavy rain over the weekend, the stepping stones were totally submerged and the water was gushing. Never fails to impress.

More attractions added for summer,"Was pleasantly surprised that a huge car park has opened up with a mock beach, donkey rides and large machinery exhibits. A toy train can also transport you from the car park to the main entrance. There was a £5 car park ticket and was surprised to be charged an entry fee of £5 per person too. However I have got tokens too with ticket to have free entry thereafter. I do not grudge the payments as it a great visitor attraction. I must have gone after 6 years to observe the changes.

Love this- never fails to impress,I am surprised to read 3 unfavourable reviews. I have not used the take away service and always sit there and eat. Always take a detour if I am travelled west on M62 back home or if I am in Batley. The place is run by a young Tamil couple who offer the most extensive menu. Not sure how they do it as all dishes always taste as if they are freshly cooked. I always have either the masala dosa or the chicken tikka dosa but have tried some curries that friends have ordered. Their rotis are phulkas and come extremely hot. I am from India which has diversity of food and can undeniably say that this family does justice to Indian food. Great value.

Lots to do,"Went to this island mainly for the big Buddha. Did not realise this is a recently developed tourist attraction with steep deep steps to climb up to see Big Buddha. There are also virtual reality experiences, some exciting immersive games, restaurants and cafes. For a strange reason unknown to me the 7/11 store was closed over a long lunch period when tourists would use it the most. I missed the last bus to explore a sleepy fishing village. Spent the best part of a day here. I gather there are lovely nature trails too but I did not have time or energy to explore them during my short visit. Would strongly encourage to take the Cable car to get there to enjoy the spectacular views. I did see some people walk up the hill.

Thoroughly enjoyed the ride on the glass bottomed cabin,Be prepared to stand in a queue especially if you wish to go to Big Buddha in the morning. You have a choice of glass or ordinary bottomed capsule at different prices. I was in the glass bottomed cabin which was interesting but to be honest you look straight ahead and get lost admiring the spectacular views that you forget to look below. Every other cabin is a glass bottomed one and as it is s bit pricier you are likely to on your way faster if you pay the bit extra. Most certainly the best way to go to big Buddha.
