Short vacation during our trip to India.,"Today is our last day and it almost feels like we are leaving our family and friends.

Adult night out,Place was full due to an engagement party so we set at the bar. Ordered dinner at the bar. Service was fantastic at the bar and bar tender was very responsive but I am not sure what happened to the taste of food. Ordered club sandwich and got wrap. My wife asked for salad and cutons were like large PCs of bread. I am not sure what is going on but they need to tighten on quality and presentation. What happened to the best potato fries ?

Worst experience,"We were trying at Petinos Beach Hotel. Restaurant right under our room. Thought owned by same owners , room charge aaa not allowed.

Perfect service AAA rating by us.,"Pre arranged out Airport transfer on line and Nikos was quick in replying. In time at Athens Aiport and our way to Electra Palace. Chauffeur was very polite and knowledgeable and guided us for lots to see in Athens. Called Nikos on his cell phone and requested to arrange city taxi service for next two days. Made several 5 -6 hours trips to see various places. The chauffeur Consto was truly a great chauffeur and guide combined. We really enjoyed our time with him.

Last evening , sent a message to Nikos for time hangs on next morning flight and got answer back in few minutes confirming the change. I came to know that Nikos was on vacation but still attended to work. This guy is a workaholic.

Great for us that we found them. It was truly a pleasure visiting Athens and learning the history. Will surly visit back when time permits.

Not happy at all,"Reached hotel after delays in ferry times. Reached and called for their complimentary shuttle and it took 25 min for driver to show up. By the time we reached hotel , it was 2.45pm and we had only one night. Took us to Petinos Hotel ( sister company ) and again had to wait for bellboy to come and get us. Finally at the hotel and they had one person at the desk. It took us over 35 min to check in and it was 3.45pm before we reached the room. Loactio. Was good and view was good but later in the evening we found out that the room they gave was right on top of their restaurant and we were getting constant noise of loud motor running. Finally after dinner at their restaurant ( WILL NOT RECOMMEND ANY ONE SUE TO THE ATTITUDE OF WAITERS ) when came up in room to sleep , just could not because of noise. Called the front desk and call went to their sister hotel and guy on the other side of the line was most rude person I have ever heard in my life. Finally got the front desk after 10 min and asked them why this noise. I was told that this is the first time they have heard any complaint. So I asked them to send someone and confirm. Got the technical person and from my room , he confirmed to the front desk about the noise. Said it is from the restaurant and should go away when they close ( midnight ). They asked us if we wanted to change our room at 10.30pm !!! Whole night we could not sleep.

Hotel website confirmed room service but no room service on our side of the hotel. Said we will have welcome bottle of wine , I have not seen till this date. It’s a shame that such a great location and such a waste of money Euro 480.

In the morning they offered me discount and it bout asking what they wanted to give , I just asked them for the bill and hey adjusted 30%. Big deal.

Be careful with your expectations. If high, you surly be sad.

I will wait and see their reaction and if I receive any explanation or word of sorry and compensation or no, and update my review.",August 2018,Petinos Beach Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g659660-d235760-Reviews-Petinos_Beach_Hotel-Platys_Gialos_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,1.0,4.5
House warming visit,"Nice location but surprised that they don’t keep Tea in room and no bottled water. Even though you are Platinum member , you don’t get them in room.
