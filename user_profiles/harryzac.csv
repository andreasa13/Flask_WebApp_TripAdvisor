"This is a great cinema, don’t turn up and be an annoyance","This cinema is really good. Oldham needs it. The staff are great and really friendly and helpful. Why do you go to the cinema? To see a film obviously. Then why, oh why, do complete idiots turn up and decide their miserable lives are much more important than the film everyone else is trying to watch. Wednesday evening; The Joker. Two people arrived late, talked loudly to each other continually. We’re sssh’d...no effect. One person stood up and told them to be quiet....no effect. One lady went out to get a member of staff... no effect. Then it all kicked off and I got management. They were eventually ejected shouting at us (the people who wanted to watch a film) that they were sure we all had miserable, boring relationships. Apparently they wanted a refund for their tickets on their way out. Whoever you are, if you want to be a source of entertainment, train and be an actor or do it at home please and get on with your boring, miserable relationship in the discomfort of your own surroundings. Bravo to the staff for ejecting them and may you never succumb to bullies.",February 2020,Odeon Oldham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g528791-d11876700-Reviews-Odeon_Oldham-Oldham_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Oldham, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Definitely worth a visit,"Four out of the five courses were exquisite. As a Valentine’s menu it worked really well. The bass was cooked to perfection, as was the scallop, the beef was excellent (with a strangely balancing onion and pithiver accompaniment) and the mushroom consommé was delightful. The tarte tatin however was not so good, with pastry rather heavy. I was surprised at the lack of common sense by the waiting staff. We’d just been served with a glass of Prosecco when the white wine we’d ordered was opened and offered to be poured. Also, the food was brought with no explanation as to what we were eating...I know we had the menu, but that’s hardly the point. There was entertainment too...a lovely voiced singer with the unenviable task of being background music. It was Valentine’s Day...perhaps the choice of Adele’s “Someone Like You” (pining for a lost relationship), Will Young’s “Better Leave Right Now” (getting out of a relationship) and Billy Paul’s “Me and Mrs (changed to Mister) Jones” (having an adulterous, clandestine relationship)...amongst other similar tracks were not great choices.",February 2020,James Martin Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d4874546-Reviews-James_Martin_Manchester-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Went on a 5 star recommendation. Disappointed,Grange-over-sands is lovely and we were told we had to visit the Haslemere Cafe. We did. Rather pushy as to how many cakes we wanted. Lots on offer. Sadly the cakes were nothing special. What a shame.,January 2020,The Hazelmere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190792-d799303-Reviews-The_Hazelmere-Grange_over_Sands_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Grange-over-Sands, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
"Lovely faded grandeur, let down by the restaurant","We got a great deal on Groupon so, for the price, I really mustn’t complain. Plus the toilet seat was broken in our allotted room and we got upgraded to a suite, with a bay view, which was fabulous. So thank you for that. Tea and biscuits on arrival and a walk round the hotel, which is huge, was very nice.
There is a meal “deal” as part of the package and you can also eat à la carte. The restaurant is vast, the tables all a little rickety and what a difference a table cloth would have made to the ambience. We asked to move from our first table because it was a danger to any liquids. The waitress, strangely, wasn’t thrilled but we were allowed! The next table was better but still unbalanced. They were very keen to take orders, get on with the next course and I’d honestly just swallowed my last mouthful of boeuf bourguignon when I was asked what I wanted for dessert.
The mains are served as a carvery, which is fine, except the veg...cauliflower and broccoli seemed like they’d been stewing since Christmas and the roast potatoes were, conversely, undercooked. All in all a bit like school dinners.
It’s too much like a barn for any intimacy or atmosphere in the restaurant and the staff, though pleasant, really gave me the impression they were keen to finish their shift.
Breakfast, we decided we’d like to sit by a window as the sky and view was lovely...but we were not allowed!!! We had to sit where we sat the previous night. More echoes of school and absolutely no logic applied. And finally, while eating, I really do not want the bin, slops tray and dirty crockery wheeled around through the tables to aid clearing up. Great for the staff, shoddy for the customer.
On leaving, not a word from reception as to whether I’d enjoyed my stay...indeed barely a grunt.
Haute cuisine, silver service and common sense are not on this establishment’s tick list. However, the walks are lovely and I guess you get what you pay for.",January 2020,Cumbria Grand Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190792-d193502-Reviews-Cumbria_Grand_Hotel-Grange_over_Sands_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Grange-over-Sands, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
"Excellent hotel, great rooms, pool & beach","We moved here after a not so pleasant experience nearby. I’m so glad we did. Got a great price at reception and an even better one through Agoda and reception were really helpful throughout. Instantly the lobby is airy, which leads into a fabulous pool and then the beach which has a cordoned off “safe swim” area. There are several types of rooms, all have a sea view and a balcony. We were on the 23rd floor and looked out over the bay and the town. The rooms are bright and well equipped with complimentary toiletries and water + a fridge and a safe. The beds are comfortable and lots of wardrobe space.
Breakfast is multi-cuisined and very good. There are on-site shops and, bizarrely, their merchandise is cheaper than the markets for some items. There’s also an upmarket designer handbag shop Tek-Tek (very reasonable) and a very good competitive Sri Lankan jewellers.
The hotel is on the main road opposite some great restaurants and a short walk to the Tuesday night market. It offers free shuttles to Batu Ferringhi and Georgetown daily if you book and the bus stops are right outside.
If I have a gripe with the hotel, it’s the fact I do not understand their policy of chaining the sunbeds in the garden. It’s annoying and petty. However it’s a minor blip on an otherwise unblemished stay and I’d definitely stay there again.
A tip: Download the Grab App as soon as you arrive in Malaysia. Taxis are half the price of ordinary cabs, turn up within minutes and are very reliable.

This is by far the best restaurant we tried.,"This is by far the best restaurant we visited. Best for ambience, best for “restaurant” prices and best for food. Kim, the owner, used to have a restaurant in the City of London and came back to Penang to open his present establishment and Tanjung Bungah should be very pleased he did. Great service and a really excellently varied menu with good drinks too. Something for everyone I would say. It’s a relaxed atmosphere with great original art on the walls and always busy. If you’re in the area, even if you fancy a bus ride from Georgetown, it’s a refreshing change and well worth it. The breakfasts look good too.",January 2020,The Hillside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1905494-d6619804-Reviews-The_Hillside-Tanjung_Bungah_Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Nice, friendly and a change from street food.","It’s a nice place. It’s not pricey and the staff are really helpful in describing dishes you may not have experienced before. For me, it was a little soulless inside and my food, although cooked perfectly in a clay pot, wasn’t to my taste. My wife’s food was excellent but still I don’t believe better than similar establishments. It’s a strange thing in Penang that if you leave the “street food” circuit, you’re hard pressed to find restaurants that produce something significantly different.",January 2020,Claypot Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1905494-d4611822-Reviews-Claypot_Restaurant-Tanjung_Bungah_Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
"Excellent value, excellent treatment","I love a good massage, but so often they are average. MV Bayu offer lots of packages and deals...the best, in my opinion, is the 1 hour massage and 40 minute reflexology for a staggeringly good 80rm. The reflexology, including a jelly wash, is very thorough and the massage is superb. It’s not gentle but very therapeutic. If you’re in the vicinity of Tanjung Bungah MV Bayu can be found at the end of the row of shops, opposite the food market between Copthorne Orchid Hotel and The Cove. Try it. It’s definitely worth it.",January 2020,MV Bayu Foot Reflexology,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2146250-d12882513-Reviews-MV_Bayu_Foot_Reflexology-Tanjung_Tokong_Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Wasn’t expecting much, but it’s brilliant.","A short walk at the end of the 101 bus route (4rm for two people) past Batu Feringhi is the Penang Butterfly Farm. A really easy journey. It’s so much more than a butterfly house. Monitor lizards, a myriad of frogs, snakes, fish, flowers and close encounters with spiders, scorpions, millipedes and wonderful leaf and stuck insects. The butterfly element is beautiful with hundreds of free-flying species. It’s easy to spend several hours there. Loads of interactive stuff for children and great entrance fee reductions for children and those over 60.

Lovely gentle day out,"The gardens are beautiful and so worth a visit. Use the Grabit app for a taxi...10rm from Tanjung Bungah. The no. 10 bus from Georgetown is very erratic and possibly not worth the saving of rm or the wait.
The gardens are free and the trails and various areas lovely. Black squirrels, monkeys and butterflies in good numbers. Good signposting and well-kept pathways...although you can hire a car to take you round. For me that’s missing the point of the gardens. Absolutely a must when in Penang. Good gift shop too.

Not as exciting as I’d read about,"I’d read a lot of great reviews for this establishment...so, having been turned away from a German restaurant because we had no reservation, we didn’t fancy street food so decided to give this place a try. It’s an odd mix and I feel it may be a daytime establishment as opposed to an evening eatery. The place was deserted at 8.30pm...not a great sign. However, we decided to eat. The chicken breast was nice but the brown pepper sauce was incongruous. My chicken thigh was okay but the hainaiman sauce a bit of a mystery. Meals and drinks at double the price of elsewhere with no real justification. Clean but lacking atmosphere with a sense they were hoping to close as soon as we’d finished. Shame but it didn’t live up to the reviews for me.",January 2020,Baa Baa Black Sheep,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298303-d6662103-Reviews-Baa_Baa_Black_Sheep-George_Town_Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",restaurants,3.0,4.5

Fabulous. Worth the money,"I was reticent as I’m not great with heights but I’m so glad we did it. It’s 68rm or 48rm if you’re over 60. Take ID. Security is bonkers, checking you every few feet and getting in isn’t as straightforward as it might seem but you’re always pointed in the right direction. The 65th floor is good. Don’t get stung for photos here. If you want official photos, wait until the 68th floor. Although selfies are just as good in my humble opinion. The views are fantastic and if you can overcome any fear of heights you may have, the glass walkway out over the edge is amazing. There’s no time limit on your stay. Enjoy it.

Sadly not up to standard,"Before I begin, the manager and staff cannot do enough and none of what I’m about to say should reflect on them.

I felt forced to leave and find another hotel and the manager offered a full refund, for which I am grateful.

There is no animosity in this just common sense. The hotel needs to close, renovate and start again. The Copthorne group needs to listen and respond. I cannot be alone in my criticism. The advertisement for the hotel should reflect these issues otherwise holidaymakers, perhaps who feel they cannot complain or move, silently accept the conditions.

The private beach is secluded but has no facilities, no sun beds, no shade, no toilet, no bar. The pool has no bar and never any staff nearby to ask for “room” service. The cafe is closed all day. The spa is closed. The walkway to the beach is like a building site. Bags of concrete on the beach. Broken fitments in the room. Shabby, stained and badly repaired carpets. Stained bath. Overgrown roofs. Unattended gardens. No soundproofing in the rooms. The garden overlooking the beach...closed despite posters in the lift advertising this as a lush green space for sunbathing. Broken sunbeds...and very few at that. Breakfast was okay, if a little chaotic, but pastries and pancakes were poor.

The pool is good, mostly quiet through the day and clean. If you can turn a blind eye to the dilapidation there’s nothing wrong with the hotel per se but there are better options to be had nearby.

I thank the hotel for their understanding and appreciate the difficult position they are in when it comes to complaints.

No. Nothing NOTHING could persuade them to bring more pitta. “Eat the free bread” was the response. The barker then said he should have mentioned there was only one pitta.

Shoddy customer care,"A family meal when we visited parents who live in Harlech. They suggested this restaurant as it looked nice and was newish. Before I get into criticism, let me just say the food was very nice. However, two lamb dishes were ordered one pink, one well done. Upon serving, the difference was indistinguishable. Not a huge problem as the well done wasn’t well done enough and the pink wasn’t pink at all , so a sort of uncaring average was dished up. More concerning was the piece of spiral metal discovered in the mashed swede. When we called the waitress over she wasn’t too bothered but mentioned she’d speak to the chef. When I asked later for any conclusions, she said there was nothing in the kitchen that could cause this. Not the response I was expecting. No apology. At a third asking, the same reaction. I paid...no apology, nothing. My wife then had words and again...very little concern. This is not a restaurant I shall be returning to or recommending. Clearly there was no manager on duty, clearly the chef didn’t care and clearly the waitresses were out of their depth in dealing with a situation such as this.

The rooms are nicely furnished and, if you have a room at the front, lovely views over the dales. The bathrooms are compact but perfectly adequate and the breakfasts are varied and freshly prepared. All rooms are en-suite and it’s situated in a quiet road with lots of free parking outside the door. It’s a five minute stroll to the centre of town and another five to Derwentwater. A definite recommendation for this lovely guest house and I’m only sorry for my next trip here they are fully booked.",May 2019,Eden Green Guest House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186327-d1070044-Reviews-Eden_Green_Guest_House-Keswick_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Keswick, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,5.0
Very good,Friendly welcome. Well appointed rooms. Very close to the city centre. Good above average continental breakfast with lots of choice. 24 hour bar and toasties available until late. Really confusing room signage as they’ve got rooms across a walkway and it’s not clear when you exit the lift. Definitely worth a short stay. Probably good for The Fringe Festival in August although I’m sure prices will escalate. Book early. Free parking on the road outside between 6.30pm - 8.30am if you’re lucky enough to grab a space otherwise it’s £17 per day (discounted for the hotel) at Waverley Station.,May 2019,Motel One Edinburgh-Royal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186525-d3820122-Reviews-Motel_One_Edinburgh_Royal-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0

Quality theatre,A terrifically welcoming building where all the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. The facilities are excellent and the theatre spaces exciting and people friendly. A good shop with lots on offer and quality entertainment on offer in both theatres.

A real treat,"Working just across the road, this quiet luxury hotel is a friendly comfortable retreat. The rooms are really comfortable with plenty of space and the bathrooms are excellent. It’s a deceptively big hotel with some rooms a confusing walk away from reception and the outside world. Yes and coffee, fruit and water are complimentary with good wardrobe space, a safe and a fridge in every room. The breakfasts are excellent with an extensive menu. There’s free car parking but to exit you need the daily code from reception. The outside areas are lovely too.
A few unfortunate events such as cold scrambled eggs, broken plumbing and noisy upstairs neighbours were all handled and rectified quickly and efficiently and surprisingly didn’t detract from the ambiance of the hotel. More than pleased to stay here again.",May 2019,The Arden Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186399-d1806106-Reviews-The_Arden_Hotel-Stratford_upon_Avon_Warwickshire_England.html,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Good hotel a short walk from the city centre,I’ve been staying here for business trips this last month. The rooms are comfortable and the breakfasts are excellent. The staff are helpful and pleasant. There are numerous good restaurants nearby and it’s five mins to Haymarket Station and ten minutes to the city centre. The only niggles are a poor shower screen design means you’re very likely to flood the bathroom floor and the lifts can take an age in the morning.,May 2019,Leonardo Royal Edinburgh Haymarket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186525-d209118-Reviews-Leonardo_Royal_Edinburgh_Haymarket-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Terrific Nepalese,"Don’t be fooled into thinking this is just another “Indian” restaurant. First, it’s a Nepalese and second the food is a cut above. It’s slightly out of the city centre but really close to Haymarket Station so really accessible. The food is excellent and there are lots of genuine Nepalese dishes on the menu. The owner is really welcoming and the staff are lovely. Treat yourself, make the short walk from the city centre and I promise you’ll enjoy a lovely, beautifully cooked meal.",April 2019,The Khukuri Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186525-d1316113-Reviews-The_Khukuri_Restaurant-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Really great food,My partner was working in Llangollen and finished late. We were recommended here and I’m glad we took up the choice. Homemade wraps with beautifully cooked chicken & lamb.

Excellent boutique stopover,"I don’t normally have need for a hotel in this part of London but what a lovely surprise. A straight and easy 10 mins walk from Old Street underground station, it is situated behind a popular pub just across from Shoreditch church. The staff are really helpful and welcoming. The rooms are comfortable, clean and well insulated from street noise. A good shower in a compact but perfectly adequate bathroom, free water in the fridge and tea/coffee facilities in the room. Comfortable bed. Plenty of plug sockets. Free WiFi. Adequate wardrobe space and a safe. Breakfast had lots of healthy choices with the option of cooked eggs on request. Again, helpful and friendly staff. I guess you could base yourself here for a few days sightseeing. It’s an easy walk into the City, the overground and several tube lines. Great for overnight. Very reasonable. Highly recommended.",April 2019,Shoreditch Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d4882813-Reviews-Shoreditch_Inn-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
"Great food, lacking atmosphere.","There’s a great deal all through February. £22 for 3 courses and a cocktail. The food is really good with an interesting choice on the special deal. My ham hock terrine with piccalilli starter was excellent as was my lamb breast followed by a delightful pannacotta. My tequila cocktail was delicious too. My partner had the goat’s cheese starter, the salmon followed by the parkin (too heavy for me) but lovely nonetheless. The service is attentive and isn’t obsequious. The problem really is the atmosphere. It’s sort of soulless. Now I know there’s an argument for saying it’s the company you keep and you make your own ambience and we have no problem having a lovely time but it’s just cold. Maybe it’s because it was Wednesday and it wasn’t that busy. It just doesn’t have the feel of a top quality restaurant and it should. I don’t know. It’s still a great deal and it’s probably worth it just for that.",February 2019,Harvey Nichols Second Floor Bar and Brasserie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d1395518-Reviews-Harvey_Nichols_Second_Floor_Bar_and_Brasserie-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_Engla.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Most economic and by far the best,"Having been offered a “good price” for airport/hotel/airport transfers via LastMinute.com, I thought I’d compare a local company’s prices. Suntransfers stood out as the best priced. It was easy to navigate the website and the whole process was cheap and quick. However, the quality of the service was definitely 5*. The driver was waiting at “arrivals” at the airport and arrived on time for the return trip from the hotel. It’s a dedicated private, clean taxi/minibus not a multi-drop-off bus with efficient, English speaking drivers. I’d highly recommend this company and would definitely use them again for transfers.",February 2019,Suntransfers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d8121873-Reviews-Suntransfers-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5

Oh dear. Dreadful.,"I was so looking forward to this meal. I reserved a table to be sure of getting in. I chose a table at the front as I was informed there would be entertainment for Valentines‘ s Day. Where do I begin? Lovely welcome. It’s busy. It’s Valentine’s Day. The menus are brought and search as we might, no wine. We ask. Two wines are offered. (Why isn’t it on the menu??) Two whites, two reds. We try a white. Warm and not very nice. We pass. We stick to cocktails. Nice. We’re offered a lacklustre “Valentine’s” meal. We pass. Service...pretty sparce. Why? They’re preparing for the entertainment. Suddenly three children (hilarious for the parents) decide they are the floorshow. Not quite as romantic a meal as it might have been. I don’t blame the children. I do blame the parents. I do blame the staff for taking no notice. I’m asked if everything is alright. I say it’s not exactly a romantic meal and a word is had. No notice is taken but mercifully they are early diners and they go.
Starters: I order mozzarella and tomato salad. It arrives with 3 slices of tomato! Not beef tomato, but ordinary salad tomato. The “entertainment” begins. A worse display of a below average, end of term amateur dancing class dross I have never seen. This is followed by, what seemed to be a beauty parade, for maybe the single men in the audience. This was interspersed with the owner, puffed up to make Narcissus seem humble, performing pretty dreadful illusory magic. It’s all excruciating.
The mains come. My black sepia is okay. Definitely nothing special. My partner’s prawn pasta, which she was assured would be served shelled, had 2!!!!!! prawns in it and they were in the shell. I complained and was met with a beaming smile. No apology. Just an assurance that prawns had been used to make the sauce followed by a beaming, apologyless smile. The dreadful, out of sync, under-rehearsed, worse than amateur, lacklustre, poor excuse for a romantic evening’s entertainment mercifully ground to a halt. We paid an overpriced bill and left. I hear the ice cream is nice.",February 2019,Massimo - Italian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297700-d1140897-Reviews-Massimo_Italian_Restaurant-Sanur_Denpasar_Bali.html,"Sanur, Indonesia",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Terrific cocktails,"We didn’t eat here so this is just about cocktails. I’d say they were the best in Sanur. The selection is different to other places, they’re served in proper sized glasses and the correct branded spirit is used. Another plus is a long “happy hour” until 9pm and you can mix and match rather than have to buy two of the same. Great, smiling service and clearly a terrific mixologist.",February 2019,Caramel Restaurant at Kamuela Villas Sanur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297700-d1946170-Reviews-Caramel_Restaurant_at_Kamuela_Villas_Sanur-Sanur_Denpasar_Bali.html,"Sanur, Indonesia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good and worth a visit,Very cheap entrance fee and spectacular views. You can swim in good weather but in the rainy season it’s not allowed. A lot of sometimes slippery steps down and a hard climb back but definitely worth it. You can brave two narrow bamboo bridges if you feel balanced and brave to get to the other side. Surprisingly the shops start at prices you have to haggle down to in Sanur.

Avoid except for the view,"An overpriced less than average cafe/restaurant that’s only saving grace is the view. If your driver takes you here, say no and stop somewhere along the road. There are plenty of places nearby. It’s a captive tourist clientele where everything is roughly twice the price you can get it elsewhere. The service is slapdash. My soup (a very small bowl) arrived a good fifteen minutes after my partner’s “jaffle” sandwich served with 9 French fries. The sandwich was soft, floppy and unappetising.

Great quirky place to eat,"The tastiest food I’ve eaten since arriving in Sanur. Only a handful of tables in what looks like a local, ramshackle cafe but don’t be put off by appearances. The welcome and the food are exceptional. The cocktails are made with the real thing and served with ecologically thoughtful bamboo straws (which you can purchase too). The portions are generous and the menu is really different from the run of the mill usual fare. They even threw in a complimentary Arak for good measure and the while bill came to just over 300 IDR. Definitely returning.",February 2019,Warung Baby Monkeys,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297700-d8368951-Reviews-Warung_Baby_Monkeys-Sanur_Denpasar_Bali.html,"Sanur, Indonesia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Not sure what the fuss is about,"I’m not sure what prompts people to eat here over and above the delightful, tranquil restaurants on the beach. The traffic noise and fumes from the main street are overpowering.
The drinks are so-so...served with, what I found to be, a lethal thick glass straw...and, all the right ecological reasons aside, bashing your teeth on the end is no pleasant thing.
My nasi campur was tasty but caused dreadful indigestion. My partner’s chicken stir fry came in a broth which she said was delicious.

Best meal so far,"I read some reviews, checked it out during the day and, after hearing a random passer-by comment it was the best fish restaurant in town, I reserved a table for the evening. Surprisingly there was no need for the reservation although I imagine in the height of season there might be. Terrific menu and amazing prices. Large cocktails (often they are quite small in other establishments) and good portions for mains. We ate different versions of mahu-mahu fillets. Both came with lovely accompaniments. The fish was cooked perfectly. We both had dessert and a fresh coconut. The whole meal cost 340,000 rupiah. Amazing.

Very good. Worth a visit,"Eaten here twice now. Free garlic bread and tea or coffee with each meal. Lovely setting on the beach with shade and shelter if there’s sun or rain. Good menu although the beef rendang could do with lots more sauce even though the texture of the meat is perfect. Lovely spicy tom yum gung and well presented meals. The Balinese black rice pudding is a real treat. Friendly and attentive staff.
