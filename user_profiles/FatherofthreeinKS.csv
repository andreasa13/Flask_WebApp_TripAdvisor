Best meal in ages,Was hungry for Mediterranean but tired of the places I've been. Decided to give this place a try. So happy I did! The chicken shwarma platter is so well spiced.

"When you can't walk anymore, eat here","Cute little place, staff was nice (I think one of the young waiters actually made a date with some other English-speaking tourists when we were first sitting down, good for him!) very much enjoyed my pasta alla amatriciana.

Comfy place for your Athens visit,"We had a reservation and arrived at about 8 PM, 2/2/20. My daughter beat on the door for a few minutes and one of the managers/owners appeared to let us in, they manage this somewhat remotely, kind of alarming at first, but a very nice gentleman appeared and got us situated, utterly charming guy. .The room was lovely, immaculate and comfortable, had everything we needed. My team was playing in the (American football) Superbowl at 2:30 AM that night, and I couldn't get the TV to work, and it never did - Wifi was fine. Otherwise, the hotel was perfect. There was a woman making breakfast out on the patio, the breakfast was very good, made to order. The hotel is very well located to anything you need in Athens (Syntagma square for transport) and all the important sights. I guess they're connected with the ice cream/sweet shop on the corner of the building, and they graciously gave us a discount. Highly recommend this hotel. I don't know when I'll be back in Greece again, I'm already aching to get back, but I'd stay here next time.",February 2020,Plaka Arch Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d19090514-Reviews-Plaka_Arch_Suites-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
"If you're in Prague, you'll go here anyway!","One of the highlights of Prague. If you're visiting Prague, you'll of course visit this. St. Vitus will take your breath away. it's glorious, on par with any cathedral in Europe. They don't actually let you see much of the castle, but what you can see is amazing. The last place we went was the hall of armor, the highlight of the whole place for me, and Golden lane. On my way out I hit the dungeon, which is real as far as I know, and ticked all my boxes as a fan of Medieval history, horror movies and Game of Thrones. I don't need to tell you this, you're already going there.

"Very near the Pantheon, go","I'd been to Rome 10 years ago, and missed a lot of stuff due to travelling with kids. My travel partner, my youngest, is older now and a road warrior like me, so we finally went. It's beautiful, and the tromp l'olieil ceiling is worth seeing.

Not just the Mouth of Truth,"Before our trip, my daughter mentioned she wanted to see this. It's just north of the Circus Maximus if you're visiting the Colosseum and Forum (and you should.) There was a huge line (even during very low tourist season) to get your picture with the Mouth of Truth. which is outside. Inside, the church is beautiful, they've got a shrine to the (alleged) skull St. Valentine.

You should visit,"First visited 10 years ago, on my first trip to Rome. The crypts are of course the big draw. At the time, you just tossed a donation in a basket and visited about five very creepy arched rooms adorned with the artistically arranged bones of many many former monks (and children, not sure where they came from,) along with mummified Capuchin monks still in their brown robes. The last crypt has a sign that says """"What you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be"" in several languages. They were hard core. Beware, you're going to remember seeing this. Since the first visit, they've added a stiffer admission price and a whole museum about the religious order. The church itself is beautiful, don't skip it. I remember standing there on my first day ever in Europe, jetlagged as all hell, thinking, ""this is what a 500 year old church smells like?"" Shakespeare could have gone there. You should too.",January 2020,Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d256340-Reviews-Santa_Maria_della_Concezione_dei_Cappuccini-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.0

Time travel to ancient Rome,"We were in Rome 10 years ago and I don't think they even had tours back then, so I wanted to finally see this. Buy your tickets online in advance, they only tour on weekends in small groups. We wore hardhats and walked through what they've excavated of Nero's palace from the first century. We had an English-speaking guide, and they do a fantastic (multimedia) job of explaining what you're looking at. At one point, you put on some VR goggles in a room and they bring the room to life, as it was, overlooking the valley with Nero's artificial lake (before they built the Colosseum there later.) It was incredible, like time travel. Cannot recommend this more highly. Also, the Google maps directions to the entrance are wrong. Ignore them, you'll get lost.",January 2020,Domus Aurea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d191001-Reviews-Domus_Aurea-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5

Very odd Bone Church,"OK. This is an inexpensive and relatively easy one hour train ride from Prague. When I'm in Europe, and I like to see odd things I can't see in the U.S. The church is about a 15 minute walk from the train station. It's of course unlike anything you've ever seen, dark, dank, weird. Takes about 15 minutes. Harder to get to and see than the Catacombs of Paris or the Capuchin crypt at Sta Maria della Concezisone dei Cappuccini in Rome. Not entirely sure I'd recommend the effort.

See it with your own eyes,"Pompeii is amazing, perhaps not quite what you might expect, but you have to go to understand. If you've seen a lot of pictures of treasures from Pompeii, some of them aren't even here, they're in a museum in Naples, be aware. That being said, there's a lot here to see. TBH, there's a lot of ruined houses with nothing worth seeing, punctuated by houses with breathtaking preserved mosaics, paintings, statues, etc. I'm not saying don't visit, I'm saying you have to do a lot of work to see what you're looking for. Lots of walking, over old Roman roads, wear hiking shoes. I've been wanting to visit since I watched ""Pink Floyd at Pompeii"" years ago, and the amphitheater didn't disappoint. Most of the space under the seats is dedicated to this ""concert"" in 1971 with no audience, but they seem to know a lot of people visit because of this!

Interesting and convenient hotel near Via Veneto,"This place is a set of rooms on an upper floor in a relatively ancient building right near the Barberini metro station (currently closed, beware.)

Our room was on the 4th floor, reachable by stairs or a tiny ancient elevator (and that's OK, we travel to experience something new/very old!) The rooms are modern and comfortable. We had a little trouble with a leaky shower at first, but enjoyed the place. There's a tiny breakfast area, but oh my, the spread was terrific. Have you had blood orange juice?

"Overrated, as far as I'm concerned","I'd heard that the ramen here was good. We were there at a busy lunchtime and picked out a place and ordered through the machine, which was confusing for a first-timer.

Interesting shopping street and people watching,"This street has a reputation of catering to teen fashion needs.

Would fly ANA again,"Flew a 1:20 AM to Tokyo from LAX. In-seat entertainment was abundant. They served a light snack first. As a nervous flyer I was a little miffed that the drink cart came around only ONCE. After a respectable amount of cabin darkness, they began serving breakfast - I was offered either a Japanese breakfast (mackerel over rice) or a Western breakfast, which oddly included lasagne, Greek yogurt, and cold noodles with miso sauce - it was good but strange.

We deplaned in Naha about two hours late at some sort of barely air-conditioned barn of a building, and had to wait for buses to take us to the main part of the airport (another hour gone.)

Got to my gate not knowing anything was wrong. We started hearing rumors that the flight was delayed. We were told it was a ground hold due to weather, then it was an air traffic control issue, then it was a bird strike that caused the plane to need to be thoroughly checked (which I'm glad they were cautious about.)
