An excellent hotel !,"This was my second visit to Suzdal, and both times I stayed in this wonderful hotel! I was here in September 2018, as a member of a small group traveling across Russia. On that trip, I was alone, and I stayed for two nights. I was here again in September 2019, with my wife, as a member of a much larger group, we stayed just one night. My second stay was not as pleasant as the first one. Why? Well, we (my wife and I) were in a small room, in the main building. The room had everything we needed, and the bathroom was adequate, but on my previous stay I was in one of the villas, where the rooms are really sumptuous. However, there are advantages to staying in the main building: you don't need to walk far to the dining room, it is in the same building! Also, you don't need to drag your luggage across the cobble-stoned streets. Take your pick: grand room, but far to walk, and probably inconvenient for those who find it difficult to handle luggage over long distances. Small room, but close to all facilities! Breakfast, like the previous trip, was good. Plenty of choice. If ever I go again to Suzdal, I would love to stay in the same hotel !! Given my age, I might stay in the smaller room!",September 2019,Pushkarskaya Sloboda Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580269-d625100-Reviews-Pushkarskaya_Sloboda_Hotel-Suzdal_Suzdalsky_District_Vladimir_Oblast_Central_Russia.html,"Suzdal, Russia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Simply stunning! The best thing to see in the Golden Ring!,"I have seen several places in the Golden Ring, and I can say categorically that this huge complex of churches and other buildings is the single best thing to see! If you have at least ONE day to spare while visiting Moscow, please use it to see this wonderful place. If possible, get a guide, or join a good conducted tour, because there is a lot of explaining required. We were on a group tour, and I am really grateful to our wonderful guide for making this a most memorable day. This place is very important in Russian history, and it is amazingly photogenic. We were lucky, it was a bright sunny day. There is a fair bit of walking involved. Definitely NOT an activity to plan for a rainy day!",September 2019,The Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g445047-d321306-Reviews-The_Holy_Trinity_St_Sergius_Lavra-Sergiyev_Posad_Sergiyevo_Posadsky_District_Mosco.html,"Sergiyev Posad, Russia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Unmissable if you are in Yaroslavl !! Especially good for photo buffs.,"We saw this lovely city on our conducted tour around the Golden Ring, and we were here for one night and half a day. In my opinion, the BEST thing, by far, in Yaroslavl was the riverside walk along the Volga River. One of the best riverbank walks I have experienced, anywhere in the world. The river looks great, and there are some very interesting churches on the walk, apart from some other beautiful buildings. Very very photogenic. Even in bad weather! If it is a nice sunny day, you could not ask for more! Remember, this city is over a thousand years old, our guide regaled us with plenty of stories of the past. It is the biggest city between Moscow and the Arctic.",September 2019,Yaroslavl Embankment,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298488-d2705594-Reviews-Yaroslavl_Embankment-Yaroslavl_Yaroslavl_Oblast_Central_Russia.html,"Yaroslavl, Russia",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Worth seeing, but be prepared to walk !!","This was my second visit to Russia, and my third museum of wooden buildings (I had seen a huge one in 2018, near Lake Baikal, on the way to Listvyanka, and I had also seen a small one the same year in Suzdal). This museum is sort of in-between. Definitely worth seeing if you are doing a Golden Ring tour. We were on a group tour, and it was an ""included"" item. We had a great guide, and I feel a guide is an absolute must to get the best out of such a museum. Some of the buildings are truly amazing. Some don't have a single nail, entirely wooden. The Russians have a real knack of doing things with wood, and museums such as this are proof. Fortunately we were given about two hours to see the place, it was well worth the effort! You can go inside most of the buildings. Don't miss the churches!",September 2019,Museum of Wooden Architecture,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298482-d2357372-Reviews-Museum_of_Wooden_Architecture-Kostroma_Kostroma_Oblast_Central_Russia.html,"Kostroma, Russia",attractions,4.0,4.5
A grand hotel !!,"We were on a group tour of Russia, and we were in Yaroslavl for just one night, on our tour of Golden Ring cities. This hotel was chosen by our tour operator, and I am very happy with the choice. The room was quite big, and was very well furnished. The bathroom was a bit small, but well equipped. The dining room where we had breakfast was not very big, but good enough for the number of guests in the hotel at the time. The choice of food for breakfast was good, and the food was quite delicious. Overall, I am very happy with the place, and if ever I go to Yaroslavl on my own, I would have no hesitation in staying in this hotel.",September 2019,Royal Hotel Spa & Wellness,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298488-d3487781-Reviews-Royal_Hotel_Spa_Wellness-Yaroslavl_Yaroslavl_Oblast_Central_Russia.html,"Yaroslavl, Russia",hotels,5.0,4.5
A wonderful hotel.,"My wife and I were on a group tour, and the hotel was chosen by the tour operator. A very good choice indeed. I would love to stay here again, if ever I went to Moscow on my own. It is near the city centre, and there is at least one metro station very near. It is a very nice locality, with shops within walking distance. The room was not very big, but it was well furnished, and the bathroom was adequate. Excellent free wifi. Breakfast was good, very wide choice of food. As it is a very popular hotel, you need to go a little early for breakfast, to avoid the crowds. Staff at the front desk speak English and they are very friendly and helpful. I would strongly recommend this hotel.",September 2019,AZIMUT Hotel Olympic Moscow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298484-d299815-Reviews-AZIMUT_Hotel_Olympic_Moscow-Moscow_Central_Russia.html,"Moscow, Russia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Worth seeing. A really beautiful church.,"One for the history buffs! This beautiful church is built on the site where a much loved Czar (Alexander the second) was assassinated in the 1880's. (the Finns adore this Czar, it was he who gave the Finns autonomy, they are proud to display a huge statue of him in one of Helsinki's main squares. Surprisingly, I did not see any similar statue of him in Russia!). The problem in visiting this church is that it is easily accessible and is so beautiful that it is very popular with tour groups. That means huge crowds. Plus, the area surrounding the church is filled with stalls selling all sorts of souvenirs and other knick-knacks. These stalls add to the general confusion. Everything about this church is so photogenic. The inside, the outside, the floor, the ceilings, etc...etc... Well worth a visit.",September 2019,Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298507-d300133-Reviews-Church_of_the_Savior_on_Spilled_Blood-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",attractions,4.0,5.0
"Great for history buffs, and photos freely allowed.","This is not just a jewellery tour. The Faberge museum is a lesson in Russian history. I missed seeing this on my first trip to the city in 2018, but on my second trip last year I was delighted to note that our group leader had budgeted two hours for this wonderful place. True, if you don't get excited by history, and by small historical objects, you should give this a miss, but you may not have a choice if you are on a group tour. If you do this on your own, PLEASE GET AN AUDIO GUIDE! It is an absolute must, well worth the extra cost. We had a wonderful guide, so we got great explanations of the important pieces. There are wonderful stories behind many of the pieces. Photos freely allowed, and some of the pieces are simply stunning.

Very good hotel,"Well, it is a huge huge hotel. Perhaps the biggest hotel I have stayed in my whole life! We were on a conducted group tour, and our tour company chose the hotel. Would I stay there again, if I went on my own to St. Petersburg? Probably, if I get a good deal, price-wise. Nothing to complain. Good, spacious room, everything worked. But, being a massive Soviet era building, distances were huge. Our room was about five minutes walk from the nearest lift! Breakfast was quite good. Wide choice, and food was tasty. Staff were quite friendly, and many of them spoke some English. Overall, a good place to stay.",September 2019,Park Inn by Radisson Pribaltiyskaya St Petersburg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298507-d300215-Reviews-Park_Inn_by_Radisson_Pribaltiyskaya_St_Petersburg-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",hotels,4.0,3.5
Simply unmissable !! Especially for anyone with an interest in history.,"This was my second visit to St. Petersburg, both were conducted group tours, and I was very very sorry to miss this on my first trip. This was the highlight of my second trip. Even if you are not a history buff, this is one place you should NOT miss if you come to this city. A monument to the heroic defence of Leningrad (old name for the city), when it was besieged by the Nazi forces in WW2. One of the longest and most destructive sieges (in terms of human and material losses) in the history of mankind. Above ground the most striking object is a 50 metre obelisk, and huge statues depicting soldiers and civilians. Below it is a huge metal ring, (a symbol of the besieging forces surrounding the city). But, the best is underground. There is a huge cathedral-like hall, with all sorts of exhibits relating to the siege. You must budget at least an hour (if not two!) to see all the exhibits. There are a couple of excellent short documentaries depicting life during the siege. If you do not have a guide, ask the staff to run it for you. All very very moving. It is only when you see this memorial that you realise how awfully the Russian people suffered in WW2 ( the USSR lost around 26 million people in the war, soldiers and civilians).

A great experience.,"We were on a group tour, and one evening was reserved for a performance of Cinderella, at this theatre. If you have to see ballet once in your life, you might as well see it here. Grand building indeed. Incidentally, photos are OK till the start of the performance. In fact, the place is really photogenic, and I would strongly urge photo buffs to come really early to get plenty of shots. Once it starts, no photos and no videos! If you have binoculars, take them with you. This is one place a good pair of binoculars would come in handy!",September 2019,State Academical Mariinskiy Theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298507-d7082919-Reviews-State_Academical_Mariinskiy_Theatre-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good for history buffs.,"A grand building, with fabulous interiors, but, the real reason it is famous is because of an incident that took place here in late 1916. The Russian mystic Rasputin was murdered here, by Prince Felix Yusupov and two others. The rooms involved in the deed are the highlight of any tour of the palace. If you love history, this is a must-see in St. Petersburg. Also, if you love palaces. But, if neither history nor grand palaces excite you, give this place a miss, and spend more time in seeing the rest of this glorious city! I was on a conducted tour, so I had no choice! People with strollers will have a tough time, there are some narrow spaces to negotiate.",September 2019,Yusupov Palace on Moika River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298507-d302501-Reviews-Yusupov_Palace_on_Moika_River-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",attractions,3.0,4.5
A remarkable building. Well worth a visit.,"An amazing church! Impressive building, very very photogenic. Both inside and outside. It has an interesting history (Wikipedia has a long and detailed write-up, they give much more information than any guide book!), and it is worth reading up. Built in the 1800's, it was a museum during communist rule. An attempt to return the building to the Russian Orthodox Church turned out to be unpopular (I was really surprised when our guide told us this!), so now it is still basically a museum, with services only on special feast days. Plenty of very interesting detail inside. Photos freely allowed. Well worth a visit. One bit of advice: try and go on a nice sunny day. It is difficult to appreciate the building and get good photos from outside if it is raining!",September 2019,The State Museum St. Isaac’s Cathedral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298507-d300132-Reviews-The_State_Museum_St_Isaac_s_Cathedral-St_Petersburg_Northwestern_District.html,"St. Petersburg, Russia",attractions,5.0,4.5

From the square, many famous landmarks are just a short walk: the Senate Square, the Lutheran Cathedral, the Russian Orthodox Cathedral, Esplanade Park, Havis Amanda statue.

Worth seeing for the architecture alone!,"An amazing church! I spent a few minutes here on my first visit to Helsinki in 2018. On that trip, I was alone, and I was more keen on museums! This time, I was with my wife, so we did things on a leisurely scale. We spent about an hour here. The church has been hewn out of solid rock (floor and walls). The roof is a copper dome, and in-between there are windows which provide plenty of natural light. It is worth seeing as a church. But, even if you are a non-believer, it is worth seeing purely for the architecture. There is a small entrance fee, but it is free for those with a Helsinki card. One thing: while it is called Rock Church in English, the Finnish name is totally different. If you want directions, it would help if you write down the Finnish name! Photos freely allowed.

Worth a visit. Very photogenic.,"For Catholics like me, who are used to richly decorated churches, with plenty of statues, and grand altars, this cathedral was a bit of a letdown. However, to be fair, it is after all a Lutheran place of worship, and Lutherans don't believe in ostentation! At the very least, the outside is really photogenic. Especially on a bright sunny day. I had gone alone to Helsinki in 2018, and I had not gone inside. When I went again last year, with my wife, we went inside. If you have an hour or so to spare, and if you can climb the steps, you will be rewarded with great views from the entrance platform. Plus, having come this far, you might as well go inside the cathedral !! If you are also seeing the Russian Orthodox cathedral nearby, you could make some interesting comparisons!

A really good city tour.,"I was in Helsinki, alone, for four days, in October 2018. I took this tour and I loved it. So, when I was in Helsinki with my wife, for a week in September 2019, we did this together. When I did this tour in 2018, the stop was at the Rock Church. When I did this with my wife in 2019, the stop was at the Sibelius Monument. I am really glad, because it is impossible to see the Rock Church properly in just about ten minutes, and I had to make a second trip later to see it properly!! Whereas the Sibelius monument can easily be seen in ten minutes, as the bus stops right next to it. So, one bit of advice, IF POSSIBLE, take the tour on a day when the stop is at the Sibelius monument. Phone in advance, or ask your hotel front desk to do it for you. This tour is free with the Helsinki Card. Be a few minutes early, and sit on top. You don't get much of a view from the lower deck! The audio guide is good.

"A great place to get information, for your stay in Tallinn or further afield in Estonia!","One of the best tourist information centres I have ever seen in all my travels over forty years! Our only regret? We did not plan to stay for longer in this lovely city!!
We were staying in Helsinki for a week, and then we decided to do a day trip to Tallinn. My advice: if you go to Tallinn on a day trip from Helsinki, make a beeline for this office, in the heart of the Old Town (anybody can tell you where it is, or you can find it on Google Maps). All the staff here speak English (apart from a number of other languages!) and they are most helpful. with any kind of advice. Most important, several free walking tours leave the tourist office, at various times. There is a large board inside, which lists all the tours available that day. We had time for only two tours: Medieval Tallinn, and Communist Era. Both were absolutely fabulous. Of course, though ""free"", the tour leaders expect a small tip for their efforts. We felt they were so good, we gave them very generous tips. After all, Estonia is not a very rich country, and these tours are being conducted by young and very enthusiastic amateurs (mostly history students). The tourist office has excellent maps, and if you are staying longer in Tallinn they can help with all sorts of arrangements: accomodation, transport, etc..etc... As I said, we were on a day trip, so we did not need any of these additional services.
In conclusion: if you are on a day trip from Helsinki (as most visitors to Tallinn seem to be !!) don't waste your time going anywhere else, just come here and ask them for advice. Very friendly, cheerful, and helpful staff!",September 2019,Tallinn Tourist Information Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274958-d10382929-Reviews-Tallinn_Tourist_Information_Centre-Tallinn_Harju_County.html,"Tallinn, Estonia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent way to travel between Helsinki and Tallinn,"We took the Tallink Star, for a day trip to Tallinn from Helsinki. Booked online, the previous day, with the help of the staff at our Helsinki hotel. We took the first ferry in the morning, I think it left Helsinki around 7am. We took the breakfast option, on the advice of our hotel front desk staff. Two advantages: lovely food, and comfortable seats in the front of the ship, with good views of Helsinki as we depart, and of Tallinn as we arrive. Smooth, comfortable journey. Returned around 6pm or so (it was just a day trip to Tallinn) Absolutely no problems whatsoever, I would strongly recommend this method of travel between Helsinki and Tallinn. The terminal is well connected by tram services to other parts of Helsinki. In Tallinn, it is only a fifteen minute walk to the walled city centre. Take your passports!

An amazing service. The best way to travel between Helsinki and St. Petersburg!,"I had gone from St. Petersburg to Helsinki by the Allegro in October 2018, when I visited Finland, at the end of a trip to Russia. I loved it. Then, in September 2019, my wife and I went on a trip to Russia, and we spent a week in Helsinki, prior. We took the same train in the reverse direction, i.e. from Helsinki to St. Petersburg.
Now, whereas in 2018 I traveled first class, in 2019 my wife and I went in second class (I think the names given are ""executive"" class and ""economy"" class). It is less than one-third the price, and the seats are slightly narrower (2 by 2 in economy, whereas first class was 1 by 2). Also, in economy there was no lunch served, whereas there was lunch in first class. But, there is plenty of space for luggage in economy, and the seats are quite comfortable, so there is no need waste money paying three times the fare!!
As I said in my 2018 review, I simply cannot imagine why anyone would want to fly between these two cities !! The ride was super smooth, and the journey took about three and a half hours. Best thing, it is city centre to city centre. So if you factor in the time taken to travel airport to city at both ends, AND the requirement to go early to the departure airport for security and other formalities, I am sure train is much less time consuming!
Perhaps the best thing about going by train between the two cities, is that all official formalities (checking of passports, customs, etc...) are done on the train, while it is rolling along, by officials from Russia and Finland. You don't have to get off. You don't even have to get up from your seat! Now, that's service. Compare that with treatment at an airport, where you have wait in a queue, and stand all the time! As I said earlier, I will repeat: I cannot imagine why ANYONE would fly between these two cities! A wonderful service.

"My second stay here, and it was as good as the first, if not better!","I was in Helsinki for four days in October 2019, on my own. I stayed here, in a studio apartment. Later, in September, on my second visit to Helsinki, with my wife, I decided to stay here again. It was wonderful. We had apartment number 152. Actually, this is a two bedroom apartment, my wife's brother and his wife were supposed to join us, they had to cancel at the last moment. So, my wife and I had the whole place to ourselves. A bit too much space, but what the hell, it was divine! I am reproducing much of what I gave in my earlier review, with a few additions:

1. Exceptionally well located, within walking distance of the main railway station. We caught the airport train, and just walked the 1km to the hotel. We left the same way, we walked to the station to catch the train to St. Petersburg.
2. The apartment had everything: a small but fully equipped kitchen where you can cook all your meals, two reasonably sized bedrooms, comfortable beds, perfect security and a common use laundry in the basement to wash your clothes. A small balcony outside the central lounge area. In addition, there was a sauna!
3. The building is very near several tram and bus lines, and it is a very quiet neighbourhood.
4. There is a small supermarket about six or seven minutes away, where you can shop for any of your needs.
5. Most important of all: wonderfully cheerful and cooperative staff. One of the staff members helped us to book our day trip to Tallinn in Estonia, it was a great help!

Note: It is not dirt cheap, but then Finland is a very rich country, Helsinki is an expensive city, and you get what you pay for! I would strongly recommend this place. Having stayed here twice, I am utterly convinced this is a fabulous place to stay.

Ought to be of great interest for history buffs!,"This wonderful church is close to the Morosini Fountain (lion fountain). Worth a visit, especially for history buffs. Titus, also known as Titus the Apostle, lived in the first century and was a Cretan of noble birth. He was given his title probably because he was an associate of St. Paul. What we see today is not the original church, but the third or even the fourth incarnation of the original at this site, which was built in AD961, when the Byzantines re-conquered Crete from the Arabs. Then, when the Venetians conquered Crete, the building became a Catholic church. Later, under the Ottomans, it became a mosque !!! Finally, when Crete became an integral part of Greece after WW1, it reverted to being a Greek Orthodox church. Over the years, it suffered fire (totally destroyed), an earthquake (again totally destroyed), and was modified in many ways by its various owners. The most valuable relic here, for hundreds of years, was the skull of St. Titus. This precious relic was sent to Venice for safe-keeping during the Ottoman rule. It was brought back here in 1966.

Even if you have no interest whatsoever in its history, the church itself is really beautiful inside, though not so impressive from outside. Really worth a visit. If you go, don't forget to grab a leaflet in English, describing in great detail the history of the church, and of St. Titus.",May 2019,Agios Titos Church,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189417-d4888429-Reviews-Agios_Titos_Church-Heraklion_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Great landmark, right in the heart of Heraklion! One for the photo buffs.","We had a free hour in Heraklion, and I spent nearly half my precious time at this fountain, photographing it from every possible angle, walking around it, etc... It is located in the middle of a small square, which is probably the geographic centre of the city. Great for photo buffs!

"Much of it is in ruins, there is just a hint of Minoan glory!","We were on a cruise with MV ""Celestyal Olympia"", and we reached Heraklion early one morning. The tour of Heraklion and the Palace of Knossos was a free ""included"" tour. The palace was a bit of a disappointment. One can just get a hint of the glory of the Minoan Civilisation. Much of it is in ruins. Fortunately for us, we had a wonderful guide, who was both knowledgeable and very very enthusiastic. You DEFINITELY need a guide to see this place. Don't bother to come here and just wander around among the ruins! You will not understand anything just wandering around. Because it is all in ruins, you need to use your imagination, though the guide will have pictures of what the buildings may have looked like. Lots of walking, lots of climbing up and down over very uneven ground. Wear good walking shoes. And if it is a sunny day, wear a hat!

Amazing walled city! One for the history buffs.,"This is actually a walled city, entirely within the so called ""New Town"". About 700 metres by 500 metres. The double wall (which you cannot climb!) has a deep moat. No water, but beautiful gardens in the moat. You could descend to the moat and wander the gardens. But, if you are pressed for time, don't bother with the moat, stick to wandering the streets of the Old Town. There are different sections of the Old Town, which are utterly different from each other. The Knights Quarter is where the Knights Hospitaller lived (they ruled the island for hundreds of years). The famous Street of the Knights is here (see my separate review). Then there is the Jewish Quarter, most of whose residents were taken away by the Nazis in the war (and probably killed). Then there is the Turkish Quarter, with narrow cobblestoned streets, souvenir shops, eating places, etc..

One for history buffs !!!,"We had a great guide, he was in no hurry, he slowly walked us down this magnificent piece of history! The Knights Hospitaller ruled Rhodes for hundreds of years, this was their main drag. A lovely cobblestoned street with really beautiful medieval buildings on either side. Our guide told us that the whole place had fallen into disrepair after the Knights were driven out, but the Italians lovingly restored the ancient buildings to their past glory, when they ruled Rhodes. You can see how old the buildings are, many have dates engraved onto them. The knights came from different countries of Europe, the buildings were devoted to different language groups: French, German, Italian, English, etc..etc... This is paradise for history buffs.

"Great for photos, and also for history buffs","We were on a cruise (Celestyal Olympia), and the ship reached Rhodes early morning, and stayed here till evening. Unfortunately, it was a public holiday, so we could not get our full day free tour, but a reduced version of the city tour was available for sale! (not cheap, 45 Euros, but then nothing is cheap on a cruise!). The coach stopped at the harbour for about half an hour, to let us take photos, etc...I liked this place so much, I took the trouble to come back here from the pier in the afternoon. I spent over an hour here. It is worth it! Three things to see in the harbour area:

(a) The harbour itself! There is a story that one of the wonders of the ancient world, the Colossus of Rhodes (a huge statue of Apollo) stood at the harbour, feet on either side of the entrance. There are two highly photogenic pillars at the spot, marking where his feet stood. Ships are supposed to have passed between Apollo's feet to enter the harbour. The guide (spoilsport!) told us that it is all a myth, the huge statue was somewhere inside, that it was nowhere near the harbour. You decide!

(b) The Greek Orthodox church at the harbour. A really beautiful church! During the time the Italians ruled Rhodes, this was a Roman Catholic church, but reverted to the Greek Orthodox faith when Rhodes reverted to Greek rule.

(c) The broad road that runs along the harbour has many beautiful Italian style buildings, highly photogenic. If I remember right, the one nearest to the church was the headquarters of the Italian Fascist party during the war. Our guide said that Mussolini drove down this road, on some ceremonial occasion.

If you are tired with all the walking, you can sit down at the harbour and do some serious people watching. There are plenty of stalls selling snacks and drinks.",May 2019,Mandraki Harbour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635613-d8099471-Reviews-Mandraki_Harbour-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Unmissable, if you visit Patmos !! Combine this with a visit to the cave.","My wife and I were very happy that our ship, the MV Celestyal Olympia, visited Patmos, on a cruise around the Greek Islands. As practising Catholics, we looked forward to seeing the cave where St. John wrote the Book of Revelation. We took an optional tour (paid tour). The tour took us first to the cave, then to this magnificent monastery on top of the hill. While the cave had a lot religious significance, this monastery was a real sightseeing gem. Wonderful location, great views, and plenty of history. (it is 1000 years old, whereas St. John lived in the cave, in exile, over 1900 years ago). There is a fantastic little museum, where you can see some very interesting church treasures, including the document signed by the Byzantine Emperor Alexis in 1088, establishing this monastery. As we had taken a paid tour, we had an excellent guide, who gave us an enormous amount of information. She also pointed out the best places to get photos. The views are stunning. One caution: your transport cannot take you right up to the entrance, it will need to park a fair way below. So, there is some climbing involved. If it is rainy, the cobblestones will be slippery and dangerous.

"Great for believers, but not for tourists.","As a practising Catholic, this was one of the sights my wife and I eagerly looked forward to seeing, on our cruise around the Greek Islands. We took an optional tour (paid tour) from our ship MV Celestyal Olympia. Not cheap, but really worth it. Please take the paid tour, like we did, if you are on any similar ""islands cruise"". Ships stop at Patmos only for about four hours, it is nearly impossible to see this place and monastery further up the hill in such a short time, if you rely on public transport. Also, it helps to have a guide. As we had taken a paid tour, we had an excellent guide, who gave us an enormous amount of information. She also pointed out the best places to get photos. The views are stunning. As for the cave itself, it is somewhat underwhelming for non-believers, and for those who don't appreciate history. It is really something for practising Christians, not for sightseeing tourists. St. John the Divine lived in this cave for several years, in exile, and wrote the Book of Revelation, more than 1900 years ago! There are a few steep steps to go down into the cave (and to climb up when you leave the cave!). We went in May, and yet there were so many tourists, it was a real crush on the steps. Single file up and down. I shudder to think how unbearably crowded this place will be in high season, in July/August. I would love to go again to Patmos and stay there for a couple of days, and see this place without the crowds, and spend some time contemplating St. John the Divine. Perhaps in winter.

A fantastic sight for history buffs. And for photo buffs! Well worth going out of the way to see it.,"I had done a lot of research before going to Greece, but I never realised this is such an amazing place. I suppose it is not well known because firstly it is in a remote location, and the guide books I consulted did not give elaborate descriptions. We were on a long drive from Meteora to Thessaloniki (a conducted tour by bus) and there were groans and moans when the bus stopped at Vergina. Everyone was tired and a bit irritated. But, all that totally vanished when we saw this magnificent museum. To a man (and woman!) we were tremendously impressed. This is called ""Royal"" for a simple reason: it holds the tomb of Phillip of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, and another tomb which is reputed to be that of Alexander's son. There is some doubt about whether the latter is really the place where Alexander's son is buried, our guide gave us both sides of the story. But, the piece de resistance is Phillip's tomb, and the various artefacts relating to it in the museum. Several very large and very beautiful gold objects. Phillip was buried with all these things, along with his most recent wife. She agreed (or was forced!) to die and join him in the after-life. Fortunately grave looters did not get to this grave, (and the one purporting to be Alexander's son's) before they were properly excavated. A truly amazing museum, and really worth seeing. One of the highlights of my three week trip to Greece! (by the way, photos were allowed everywhere, except in the actual tombs).",April 2019,Museum of the Royal Tombs of Aigai (Vergina),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1082258-d2459889-Reviews-Museum_of_the_Royal_Tombs_of_Aigai_Vergina-Vergina_Imathia_Region_Central_Macedo.html,"Vergina, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Simply unmissable !!,"We had a guide, and he said many people see the Acropolis but fail to see the Museum. What a pity. The museum is truly amazing. A fantastic modern building, with numerous exhibits. There is good signage, so you could perhaps manage without a guide, but we were short of time, (we had just about an hour and a half in this magnificent place!), so our guide was invaluable. He took us to the important exhibits, and explained everything. The best thing about having a guide is that he can give you a ""helicopter"" view, and perspective, otherwise you are reduced to reading signboards and trying to orient yourself. Don't miss the ruins near the entrance. These were excavated fairly recently. Then there are the original Carytids (only five, one is in London!). The ones you see next to the Parthenon are imitations! Finally, the Parthenon Gallery on the top floor, is simply stunning. It is a virtual replica of the Parthenon itself.

"Should be right on top of your bucket list, or very near the top!","I will not attempt to describe the most important cultural site in the whole western world!

You may go only once to this place in your life, don't try to save money by not using a guide! My second bit of advice: it is positively dangerous to go here with inappropriate footwear. The ground is very uneven, and there is a bit of climbing (and descending! coming down is more dangerous than going up!) I saw two people slip and fall.

Heaven for history buffs! Should be near the top of your bucket list.,"Unmissable, if you go to Greece! The most important ancient site to see, in the whole of the Peloponnese. Some would even say, the most important in all of Greece. We were on a conducted bus tour, for our 50th class reunion, and our guide budgeted just two hours for this magnificent site. I think our guide was mindful of the fact that all of us (25 couples) were well over 70, and not too fit, that is why he did not allocate more time here. I was very disappointed. We could get just a cursory look at all the attractions. I will go again, and spend a day here. This site and its museum is worth at least four to six hours, if not more. Plenty of details available in travel books, for you to do it entirely on your own, but it may help to have a guide to explain the site (the museum needs no guide, you can do it easily on your own!) Just two small tips: Firstly, see the museum before you see the site. You will appreciate the site better, and it makes it easier for you to imagine what the various buildings were like, in ancient times. Secondly, wear GOOD walking shoes.

Not all that exciting. You could give it a miss and spend the time saved in Mycenae.,"I wasn't all that impressed with Mystras. It is not an ancient Greek site, it is basically a Byzantine site. The last place to hold out against the conquering Ottomans. Quite a few churches, and other associated buildings with a religious flavour. Our guide explained it all to us, but as we were coming straight from seeing Mycenae and the Treasury of Atreus, this site did not interest us as much. Now, don't get me wrong: there is more to actually see here, as the place is much newer (the oldest buildings here are just 800 years old, whereas the oldest stuff in Mycenae were 3300 years old!) But, if you like your history, there is plenty to see. Our guide regaled us with stories of how the Franks grabbed this place, then the Byzantines grabbed it back, and then fought off the Ottomans for many years before finally succumbing, how it declined under Ottoman rule, etc..etc... All very exciting for history buffs, but not for people disinterested in Byzantine and Ottoman history. There is even more climbing over rough ground than in Mycenae.

Paradise for history buffs!,"The ""Citadel"" is really the ruins, well over 3000 years old, of the ancient city of Mycenae, glorified by Homer in the ""Illiad"" and the ""Odessey"". Homer himself lived nearly 3000 years ago, and most people thought of all that as pure myth, till the German archaeologist Schliemann excavated the site in the 1870's. The rest, as they say is history. This is a huge site, and it proved that Homer was not just spinning yarns. It is NOT something that would excite someone with no appreciation of history. It is not all that photogenic. You could get a reasonably good idea of the place if you have a decent travel guide. But, if you want a detailed explanation, a local guide is needed. We had a local guide and he gave a fascinating description. Very impressive.
The ""Treasury of Atreus"" is at a completely different site, nearby. This is even older, dating back to 1300 BC. An amazing structure, it is also reputed to be Agamemnon's Tomb. Who was this dude? Well, look it up in Wikipedia, he was one of big shots in the Illiad. Too complicated to explain here! (there is even some doubt about whether Agamemnon even existed, but let that not deter you from seeing this place). It is a strange structure, shaped somewhat like a beehive. Truly amazing, perhaps the single most amazing thing I saw in the Peloponnese. As you stand inside the chamber, you marvel that all this is over 3300 years old !!!! You definitely don't need a guide here, just go and enter the massive chamber.

Well worth seeing! Perhaps the best sight in Ephesus.,"My wife and I were on a conducted tour of Ephesus from our hotel in Kusadasi.

But, surprisingly, only about half the group were game enough to enter this ""added"" attraction. Even my wife chickened out. Why? Because there is a fair bit of climbing stairs. What is this attraction? These are recently excavated (and beautifully restored) residences from 2000 years ago. The residences are along a hillside, and they are adjoining one another. Some are even connected. What grand apartments! What decorations! Beautiful floors! A photo buff's paradise. Unfortunately, we were on a tight schedule, we had much more to see in Ephesus, and as half the group did not join us, our guide rushed us through the exhibit. This is easily the best thing to see in Ephesus. Truly amazing. I strongly recommend it. A guide would greatly help, as it is difficult to understand the layout of the rooms in the various houses (they are properly called ""apartments"" !!!) .

If possible, try and get the brochure relating to this place from the hotel or from the tourist office, and read it thoroughly BEFORE you visit the palace. You will better appreciate what you see.

A must for history buffs!,"I would have given this place an ""excellent"", but I am restricting it to a ""very good"", because my claustrophobia, and my asthma, detracted a bit from my enjoyment of the place. Some of the passages are barely half a metre wide. Others are so low that you have to bend almost double, which is very bad for asthmatics like me. If you don't have these issues, you ought to enjoy this place. The guide (we were on a conducted tour) had a lot of details of the history of the place, how people lived underground, how they defended themselves, etc...etc.... True paradise for history buffs. And, if you are not bothered by claustrophobia or asthma, you can get some really good photographs. There are much bigger underground cities to see in Cappadocia. This is one of the smaller ones. We were taken here, because of the lack of time. Next time, I will try my luck with one of the other underground cities. I hope I can get over the claustrophobia by then!",April 2019,Ozkonak Underground City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297986-d3535159-Reviews-Ozkonak_Underground_City-Nevsehir_Nevsehir_Province.html,"Nevsehir, Turkey",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Great place to have a quick meal, while in the Sultanahmet area","We had lunch here, twice. It is exceptionally well located, very near Aya Sofya and the Blue Mosque. Excellent place to have lunch while sightseeing in the area. We discovered it by accident, it was next to our local agent (Efendi Travel) in Istanbul. Very delicious food, reasonably priced.

Good place to have a nice meal,"Sadly, we were only one day in Thessaloniki. I would have loved to go again to this place. Great food. Great atmosphere. We were a large group of nearly 50 (this was our 50th class reunion, and we were traveling around Greece), but they managed to accomodate us well, and all of us had a good time.

A wonderful airline. I would strongly recommend it.,"Very pleasant flight! New plane, which was also very clean. Seats reasonably comfortable. Check-in was very smooth, cabin staff were very friendly. There was a light snack. No complaints whatsoever. I would strongly recommend this airline. (We had one more flight with Turkish, from Istanbul to Athens, two days later. We had the same experience: nice plane and very good cabin staff. On this flight there was a fairly substantial meal).",April 2019,Turkish Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729174-Reviews-Turkish-Airlines,World,flights,5.0,4.0
Great airline!,"I had never heard of this airline before going to Turkey! Well, I was very impressed. Excellent plane (very new, very clean, reasonably comfortable seats), wonderful cabin staff. Plane was on time, flight was smooth and pleasant. I could not ask for more. My only complaint: the check-in at Kayseri was quite chaotic. No proper lines for queuing, check-in staff were harried and few in number. Perhaps this had nothing to do with the airline, it may be the airport's fault! All in all, a great experience. I would gladly fly again with them. (I kept their in-flight mag as a souvenir, on going through it I find that Pegasus has a very extensive domestic network in Turkey and quite a few international routes.)",April 2019,Pegasus Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8728979-Reviews-Pegasus-Airlines,World,flights,5.0,3.0
What a sight !!!!!,"We were a large group (a 50th class reunion, 25 couples) and we were doing a bus tour around Greece. After a couple of days in Athens, we drove to Nafplion on the Peloponnese. We crossed over the Corinth Canal, to enter the Peloponnese. We stopped here for about an hour. I wish we had more time! What a magnificent sight! A triumph of modern engineering! The steep sides are one of the most photogenic structures I have ever seen! We stood on the bridge, took many many photos and video clips. If you go, you must try and get a video of a big ship passing through the canal. We were unlucky, no really large ship passed, but quite a few small ones. Most of our group had never heard about this thing. I had heard about it, and seen pictures, but it did not prepare me for the actual sight! And it was quite a sight! Something that was conceived over 2500 years ago, but realised only in the 19th century, by the independent Greek state. The canal is cut through rock, and is just 6km long, but what is amazing is the near vertical sides, rising 300 feet from the water. We saw the canal en route to the Peloponnese, but it is also worth a day trip from Athens, entirely on its own. Just hire a taxi and come. You do not need a guide just to see the canal! If you do come this far from Athens, you might spend an hour or two in the historic city of Corinth, which is nearby. And yes, St. Paul wrote his letters to the inhabitants of this city (letters to the Corinthians) two thousand years ago. If you go to see the canal, do not miss the monument to the Hungarian engineers who played a part in its construction. This monument is on the mainland, just near the terminus of the bridge.",April 2019,Corinth Canal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1188932-d2454053-Reviews-Corinth_Canal-Isthmia_Loutraki_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Isthmia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
One of the highlights of my trip to Turkey. Paradise for history buffs!,"I was lucky to see Ephesus twice, in the space of two weeks. The first time was in mid April, on a tour of Turkey with my wife, when we stayed at Kusadasi and went on a conducted tour, a day trip, that included Mary's house. The second time was in late April, when we had a shore excursion to Ephesus as part of a cruise around the eastern Mediterranean aboard the MV Celestyal Olympia. Note: both were conducted tours, and though both the guides were good, I feel someone with an interest in history might better off without a guide. What you need is a bit of background knowledge of the place, and a good travel guide book for maps of the site. (most recent editions of travel guides have excellent colour maps and pictures). On both occasions we entered by the upper gate (there is an information centre here, for those doing the trip on their own). We then walked downhill to the lower gate. All tour groups do it this way: enter through the upper gate, walk downhill, while their transport goes to the lower gate to meet them. Very convenient. But, if you are on your own, I don't see any reason why you have to follow this pattern. You can wander around the complex on your own, in any fashion. Ephesus has been excavated for well over a hundred years, and it is the best ancient Greco-Roman city in existence: yet nearly three-quarters of it is yet to be dug up! One can only marvel at what more will be revealed! Don't miss the following highlights: the odeon, the latrines, the huge theatre (where St. Paul preached to the locals), the terraced houses, the footprint leading to the brothel, the harbour road, the agora, temple of Hadrian, and most famous of all, the totally unmissable Library of Celsus. History buffs ought to read up about all this. Even if you are not a history buff, you will find the place utterly fascinating (the guides know enough to keep you entertained with anecdotes and details of the various objects of interest. ) On one of my visits, it rained briefly and the whole place got very slippery !! There is a lot of walking over very uneven ground: wear good walking shoes. Very difficult to manage a stroller due to uneven ground.
Try and go on a nice sunny day, when it is not too hot! It will be a memorable experience.",April 2019,Ancient City of Ephesus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293976-d548950-Reviews-Ancient_City_of_Ephesus-Selcuk_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Selcuk, Turkey",attractions,5.0,5.0
