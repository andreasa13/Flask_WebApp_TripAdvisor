Great holiday apartments,"Had a fabulous 10 days here. Managing to check out 2 rooms cheekily! Room 1 was a Seaview apartment, open plan bed/kitchenette and a bathroom. It was lively and clean with everything you could need for a stay. With a balcony overlooking the sea it couldn't get better! The 2nd room we had was perfect! A living/kitchenette area, seperate bathroom and bedroom. Again nice and clean and balcony was great for an evening just chilling with the noise from the front dulled down enough to enjoy but not intrude. Best showers I've had in the area power and temperature wise! Property is in the best location, easy to get to and from with shops, bars, tavernas right on the step! I can't wait to go back there!",September 2020,Alkionides Boutique Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g13199545-d8035654-Reviews-Alkionides_Boutique_Apartments-Polychrono_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedon.html,"Polychrono, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Favourite place in the world,"I first visited this place 11 years ago. Its so good, if I'm in the area I always eat here! Nikos and Yiannis are the owners and such a pair of chilled out, laid back dudes! If you're lucky you may get one of Yiannis' 2 parrots to pose with you for pictures whilst waiting for your food! The bourgiourdi is the BEST I've ever had anywhere and the food on the whole is great. Staff are lovely and friendly and the place is just fabulous! Steak is awesome!

What a find!,"OK, so I already googled the best place to eat in Afytos and knew this was number 1. I didn't try and find it though, so when we accidentally happened upon it whilst just mooching about i was super happy! The food was just beautiful. The staff brilliantly amazing. A must order is the Mediterranean salad, the mozzarella balls were DELICIOUS! We also had the fried courgette and a chicken dish whose name escapes me but it was sautéed with mushrooms! All utterly fabulous and such a bargain price. We weren't rushed at all and left to it, although that could have been because everywhere in the area was super quiet. I wish I could eat here every day and will definitely return next time we're in the area!

Surprise birthday song,Loved this little place. Food was flavour some and tasty. We had set menu A I think which was 3 courses for 16£ which is bargainous! The staff were super friendly and helpful!

You might die of thirst,"This place is a brilliant building but it needs an overhaul of 90% of the staff. After waiting an age for a drink (20 mins I think) as there was not enough staff, the ones that were there were more interested in chatting to each other than serving the customers. I appreciate it was busy but even so.

Best place I've stayed,"This little gem is tucked away just of the seafront, but loads further north than I would normally stop. Happy we chose how we did! The place is clean, more modern than any other bnb I've stayed in. Not only that, everything worked! Shower had great pressure and hot water! Breakfast was included also and delicious! I'd 100% recommend here! The owners were so friendly, nothing was a problem or too much trouble!

Misleading descriptions,"Just returned from a 3 night break and stayed here. The hotel is about a 20-30 min walk from Syntagma sq but it is on the outskirts of the red light district which we didn't know. You need to pass through this area if you want to get anywhere towards the acropolis etc. I would not have been happy if we had kids with us. It is by no means modern as advertised and no evidence of modernisation since the 60s! We arrived quite late and were looking forward to a drink in the bar as advertised and maybe a snack in the dining room as advertised. They don't exist and again certainly not open all day as advertised. There was a dining room with the left overs of a bar but this was only for serving breakfast. Breakfast was as youd expect. Scrambled egg, mini hot dog sausages, toast, cornflakes, fruit ham and cheese. basic but as long as youre not fussy all is good. the rooms were basic but clean enough and the bed was incredibly comfortable! the shower however, although fantastically powerful was marred by the show curtain and rail which was on the wonk and so the shower curtain congregated in one corner keeping nothing dry. The room also had a fridge although im unsure if it worked and a TV that didn't work which was hanging onto the wall bracket by a cable tie. That said the hotel is ideally placed for walking almost anywhere you might wish to go to. Also it was cheap as chips and for what we paid id really only complain about the misleading descriptions (hotel and area) and amenities",December 2019,Hotel Aristoteles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d571634-Reviews-Hotel_Aristoteles-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,3.0
Great all rounder,"This hotel does what it says on the tin. Its a fabulous all rounder. Friendly staff, and the rooms are clean and pleasant with everything working as it should! You do have to pay extra if you want air conditioning (we didn't) but there was a fridge and a slightly old 2 hob cooker that we got electric shocks off if we tried to cook! the hotel has something going on every night, from quiz nights to bingo to the epic BBQ night every Saturday! This is all enjoyed with some traditional Cretan dancing. In fact, this hotel has everything you could need to never actually leave the complex! It is situated in a very hilly area so the uphill walk might be a bit much for some. The hotel itself is built on a hill side so 2 pools are at a lower level than the other 2. lawn area for sunbathing is kept beautifully. the 2 pools at the bottom of the hotel, 1 is a childrens pool the other a larger pool with 2 water slides and a pool bar serving drinks and snacks, The pools on the flatter part of the complex near the sunbathing area are clean and again one is for children the other bigger for swimmers. there is a little shop selling papers, cold drinks and snacks and other things you might have forgotten just at the top of the complex. the walk to the beach is a little scary on the mostly unlit road but it isn't unpleasant and if you carry on up the hill to Piscopiano there are some lovely tavernas with amazing views. Again it is hilly but taxis are aplenty! Would very much recommend here!",September 2019,Bellos Hotel & Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g503710-d292091-Reviews-Bellos_Hotel_Apartments-Hersonissos_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Simply the best,"I love this little hotel! It is perfectly placed for the beach and all amenities, very clean and everything is as it should be! I have only ever stopped in the older part of the hotel which has no air conditioning but have never had any issues. I love this hotel and the owner is simply amazing and super friendly! this place is small but perfectly formed!

Just do it.,"I dont need to say more really. Incredibly interesting bits of history. It's not just an ex leper colony that got shut in the 50s. It is more than that. I'd like a guide or something to walk round with, booklet not person. It would also have been good to know there are set walking routes around the island!

Brilliant few hours on a fake train,"Did the longer half day trip and it was great! Lovely pootling around the roads of crete with a few short stop offs on the way! Train does get super busy so book in advance and dont be picky if you have to sit by strangers! Each seat takes 4 people. After you've driven along the coast picking people up you go to a monastery to look around which costs 2 euros, the shop outside is highly recommended by me! That was followed by a trip to an olive oil factory and then on to a very old deserted village which was lovely. We saw a dam and reservoir that had been built in a valley and submerged an entire village, then home! Brilliant whirlwind stop off tour of places. I'd love to do it again!

Great day out!,"Well, inthink who we booked with is important here as there are so many operators running this trip! We booked with excellent crete who offered 2 different spinalonga experiences. We got the 25 euro excursion. For that we got to go to a market in Agios Nikolaos, the to plaka to get a boat to spinalonga where we paid 8 euros to get into the site, then on to a nearby beach for bbq food then home! Spinalonga was amazing. Very hilly though with lots of steps that are uneven. Not for sandals and the like! I was surprised to find this island still held lepers until the 1950s. Very interesting. We only got an hour there but that was nowhere near long enough. I think 3 hours would be perfect to see all round the island and its little nooks and end it with a mythos or 2 in the little cafe on the island.",September 2019,Boat Day Trips Spinalonga,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189416-d3263414-Reviews-Boat_Day_Trips_Spinalonga-Elounda_Lasithi_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Best chinese I've had in a while,"This place is tucked out of the way down a side street. Go passed the chinese/indian place and you cant miss it. The food is cheap as. We spent 41 euros on a carafe of wine, a noodle dish, vegetarian dish and 2 meat dishes. We couldnt finish it as there was so much. Best thing is, we were allowed to take it away in containers for later! I didnt expect the food to be up to much I'll be honest. I'm really pleased I was proved wrong!

Delicious food,"I hadnt been here in over 10 years. Wish I hadnt left it so long! The food is really tasty and so reasonably priced. We opted for the £22 per person kolossi meze, and there was so much food! 4 courses of typical Greek Cypriot fayre. Pre starter of hummus, tzatziki and taramasalata with pickles and pitta bread, followed by the actual starter then main then dessert.

Great beers and great food,"Fabulous couple of hours spent here dribbling over which of the 101 Belgium beers we were going to try! Interspersed with foodiness and it makes for a great evening! £75 for 4 beers, 3 starters and 2 mains is not bad. Prices are pretty average for the area I think.

SMALL YET MIGHTY,We were recommended to visit here by a nearby pub as we wanted food ast 6pm on a Sunday. This place was fabulous. Really super small with 2 fire places. Menu wasn't excessive but it was generous with a roast dinner averaging £14. The food was simply stunning though. Well cooked. Tasty and hot. The place itself feels really old. The staff were more than attentive which was lovely and not over the top for the venue and we thoroughly enjoyed our short time there.,January 2019,The White Hart,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1763962-d1763963-Reviews-The_White_Hart-Whelpley_Hill_Buckinghamshire_England.html,"Whelpley Hill, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Cute and attentive,Stopped off at this place randomly to get food on a day out. The pub is really olde worlde inside and very nice. A lady who we thought was a customer asked if we were ok and before bombarding with questions we asked if she was staff and she was. She could not have been more helpful although we were disappointed they stopped selling food at 3pm on Sundays. I stead the lazy took to the out to write down the names postcodes and numbers of other nearby pubs which sold food. Excellent service and so friendly. Drinks reasonably priced and we'd definitely go again.,January 2019,The Bell Inn - Bovingdon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503869-d5973592-Reviews-The_Bell_Inn_Bovingdon-Hemel_Hempstead_Hertfordshire_England.html,"Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Excellent drinks,"We went in here after an awful meal around the corner. We really wish we had tried here first though. The pizzas sounded delicious and looked fantastic and then the tapas menu which came out later on in the afternoon looked equally as impressive. he cocktails however, were delicious! I had an espresso martini and it was utterly divine. My friend had a bramble and it was so juicy and fruity and the best bit was, their 2 for 1 deal was really that! None of this it's 241 but you have to have 2 of the same cocktail, which just annoys me; nooo! ANY 2 cocktails you like for the price of 1. It was warm, cosy, the décor was simple and clean and id definitely go again to try more cocktails!",December 2018,The Liquor Tank,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580405-d15114431-Reviews-The_Liquor_Tank-Cannock_Staffordshire_England.html,"Cannock, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Extra Disappointing,"Visited with friends on 27th December. None of us had been before and none of us had been to any of the unrelated previous incarnations at the venue. Unsure if it was the fact it was lunchtime we went but from the board outside we expected burgers, kebabs etc. We got a huge shock when we went in. The venue was small and nice enough although cold and it had an odd smell about it. There was a heater placed in the room which was chucking out a lot of heat but not enough to take the chill off the air. We ordered coffee and were told the coffee machine wasn't working, no problem im good with instant or whatever way you can make coffee, its all good with me. This coffee was awful though. It was hugely reminiscent of times gone by and going to an infamous near by greasy truckers café where the coffee only tasted of smokey bacon crisps. If it was instant coffee it had either gone off/was stale or just hideously cheap. Now onto the menu... all that was on there was sandwiches/nacho type things and the like with the only hot options being fish and chips or a fry up. Not what we expected from the board outside. We ordered and then waited. Waited. Waited some more and then to top it off we waited a bit more. 4 sandwiches and 1 fry up took almost an hour to reach us. Luckily we were busy catching up and the cocktails we had were nice enough although nothing special. When the food arrived it looked nicer than it tasted. My partner couldn't even eat his seafood open sandwich as he said there was too much mayo on it but the seafood was rubbery as if it was frozen but been over microwaved to defrost it. one thing I can say though was the one person who was working that day was lovely and very nice. All in all a shocking experience from a venue that is currently trying to provide something its failing at miserably. We wanted delicious food as shown on the facebook page in their pictures and the menu, we got a long wait, rubbery prawns and bacon coffee. Wont be going back at all.",December 2018,The Dining Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580405-d15685223-Reviews-The_Dining_Room-Cannock_Staffordshire_England.html,"Cannock, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,2.0
"Great cocktails, bad service","We arrived at around 6pm on a Sunday just to use the bar on 31st floor for a birthday treat. The bar was heaving so we made our way to the first available space at the bar to get a drink. Unfortunately this was at the bottom end of the bar near the glass washing area. We selected cocktails and waited and waited and waited while everyone at the other end of the bar got served before us. It took a waiter to spot us and go tell one of the bar tenders to come over. This was despite the end of the bar we were at being full of people drinking too (some had even paid their bill and we were stood right next to them). The bar tender was pleasant enough and apologised for the wait and said we should stand elsewhere to be served, to which we pointed out there was no where else to stand around the bar. Our second round of drinks went equally as abysmal. By this point we had moved away from the glass washing point too, to near a till so we would be seen, this did not work. We waited to be served and this time did get served fairly fast, except the bar tender who took our order then proceeded to take bill payments from 2 other people and then left the bar. We had no idea if our drinks were coming, being made or anything. We were then once again ignored. We were asked if we were being served by someone and we explained that we weren't sure as someone had taken our order for drinks but had then promptly left the bar and we had no drinks. We were told he would find out. We heard nothing! 2 drinks were made which we thought might be ours but we were ignored so much that the bar tender was wondering around asking where the drinks needed to go and everyone said no idea. The 2 drinks we presumed were ours were left on the opposite end of the bar to us. We waited some more and a little more until this time we were approached by who we think may have been the bar manager. He asked us if there was a problem as by this point I was getting quite angry at how much you can be ignored. I explained again that our order had been taken but the bar tender had then left, that wed already explained this to someone and got no where etc etc. After being asked what drinks we had ordered, the manager collected the 2 drinks from the far end of the bar and gave them to us apologising profusely and giving them to us on the house! Too right at £17 each, I expected better service than we got. After the bar cleared a bit we finally managed to get a table so sat down and successfully - without fuss got a 3rd cocktail from the bar! The total bill was a little shy of £80. £68 of which was drinks the rest service at 12.5%. I wish I had refused to pay the optional service now but never mind. The views made up for the terrible service, which was obviously due to lack of staff as at one point it seemed that there was only 1 person making drinks and everyone else was running round collecting glasses. Very shoddy indeed im afraid.",November 2018,Aqua Shard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d4495284-Reviews-Aqua_Shard-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Excellent hostess and lovely food,"Came for my OH birthday and from start to finish the hostess (Christina I believe) was the most amazing individual! Although we had been before, it had been a while so she briefly but not patronisingly, gave us the lowdown on the interactive table before leaving with a 'happy birthday' tablecloth! food appeared fast and was a delicious as before. The free flowing wine was very free flowing which was excellent! We were just made to feel incredibly welcome and not rushed at all - although the restaurant wasn't overly busy that evening so it was nice not to be kicked out after our time was up.

"Great views, basic rooms but dont expect a good nights sleep","The hotel is on the outskirts of Sami and about a 20ish minute walk from the port and shops. This is fine as the grounds look lovely. reception area is clean as is bar and breakfast area and the staff are lovely. Rooms are very basic but really, what more do you need other than a bed, loo and shower? There was an air con unit in our room (206 by the way) but we never figured out how it worked or even turned on. We presumed it required a remote but never asked as other reviews said you had to pay for this. I cant confirm this as when we checked in we weren't told about paying for anything other than the room/visitor tax. We had no fridge in our room either, again other reviews said you had to pay for one to be provided and indeed we did see fridges being removed from rooms when guests left but we didn't attempt to get one. The pool is a little walk (3 mins maybe) from the hotel so don't expect to walk out of the hotel straight to the pool. The pool area was lovely however with great loungers and the pools themselves were clean and free of debris and insects. The pool bar was open from 10 to 5.30 I believe which is great for drinks and snacks pool side. The indoor bar didn't open until 6pm so you were stuffed if you wanted to eat in your room mid afternoon as you would have to plod to the pool bar and then walk back with your food and/or drinks (avoiding being attacked by swarms of wasps). Evening bar tender was brilliant. very friendly and with an exceptional knowledge of cocktails :-) Breakfast was adequate with crusty and regular bread for toast, cheese, luncheon meat, cold boiled eggs, dishes of natural yoghurt, cornflakes (watch the milk as its evaporated not how us Brits are used to milk!), mini hot dogs, cut up omelettes, tinned peach slices, butter, jams and of course tea, coffee and juice.

Now for the moany bits.

There is a nose of some sort that we never figured out what it was that occurred frequently day and night. It would start with a very loud double bang then for 15ish minutes you would hear a noise that sounded like a washing machine heating up water, this would be followed by another loud bang and then silence. Scared the hell out of us the first night at 3am or there abouts. Not good if your a light sleeper!

Night reception (not always but frequently) was an older guy who spoke no English so the night that we were woken by a phone ringing in an empty room didn't go smooth. After continual ringing for 10 or so minutes my OH went to see what the hell was going on. He wasnt alone as others had been woken up too. They finally got the man to locate the room and access it to stop the phone from ringing but it took a long while and the phone had been continuously ringing for around 25 minutes by this point. So action in this instance was poor.

My last gripe was on our last day when it was absolutely chucking it down with rain because of the hurricane in the med. check out was 10am so we had an early breakfast to finish packing and get ready. we then sat in the reception/area being bored. During this time the bar was not open. There was no where for anyone to get a drink of water, coffee anything and no where to get food. By 2pm we were thirsty, hungry and the bar indoors was still not opened for us to get food/drinks. we ventured out in the rain to see if the pool bar was randomly open - but no. that was also shut. The hotel should have at least had the bar open to sell drinks and snacks for people. We ended up getting a taxi to the port and getting food and drinks there. By the time we finished the rain had stopped but this was about 4.15pm so to go all that time with no way of getting food and drink from the hotel was not very good in my opinion.

Apart from those few lengthy niggles the stay was perfectly acceptable. The bathroom fine all be the bath small and the shower was great! Although it was more like a pressure washer! Everything was clean and as comfortable as you could expect.

Id stay again only if I had a car at my disposal and the banging noises were sorted out!",September 2018,Pericles Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g678734-d288744-Reviews-Pericles_Hotel-Sami_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Lovely Food - pricier than by the port,"We had avoided this place initially as it was the closest to our hotel and we figured a majority of the people staying in our hotel would only venture to this rather than the further walk into the port area where there are more eateries. We went early (around 6pm maybe earlier) as we hadn't eaten all day having skipped breakfast and, although the doors were open the place wasn't actually open! We were allowed in though and seated and given menus anyway. There are great choices for sea food and my OH had the mixed seafood grilled plate. He said it was the best meal he had had then entire stay. My food choices were slightly more meh. Im not a big seafood fan but more over I cant eat tomatoes or sweetcorn as they make me ill. Everything seem to have a tomato based sauce or had sweetcorn in the vegetables/rice. I plumped for the kleftiko in the end and it was good but I think they must use frozen mixed veg as there was sweetcorn in my kleftiko. So whilst I found my meal disappointing it wasn't anything to do with the taste or how it was cooked etc. The starters we had were divine however. Grilled mushrooms and courgettes. slightly more expensive than tavernas by the port but still cheap enough with the average meal being around 10 euros. I think we paid 40 euros for 2 starters, 2 mains and a litre of wine and 2 soft drinks. As with 95% of the tavernas around here they DO bring you bread and butter to the table that you have not asked for. This is NOT free and will be charged at around 1 or 1.50 euros per person.

Eventually we got on a boat and although the ride around the lake was swift it was so pretty and pictureworthy you didn't mind! Theres a café and gift shop afterwards. The girst shop has just generic Kefalonia gifts and nothing lake specific but its nice to look around. Do this trip as its worth the 7 euros!,September 2018,Melissani Cave,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g8281993-d1142674-Reviews-Melissani_Cave-Karavomylos_Sami_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Unimpressive and a smidge disappointing,"I love Greece and all things Greek but this I was very disappointed at. We spent hours walking up all the damn hills on the precarious roads (for godsake hire a car!) in the heat. That was fine, the views awesome. Sign posts to the acropolis are very few but don't give up! Keep going and you will eventually arrive at a sign that tells you you are there... except you need to keep going a tad further! THEN.. you WILL get to another sign that's actually lying on the floor proudly declaring that the acropolis was funded by a million plus euros to improve it. Don't be fooled... we couldn't tell where this money had been spent and it still mostly looked like the rocks on the rest of the island except in a door way style. It was apparent that no one really came and cared for the area, there was litter and all sorts on the dirt/stone paths along the route. The views were breath taking and its a lovely walk but don't go expecting to see a great ancient monument as you will be like me, very disappointed! We did see a snake however which was cool! Loads of ants and of course those bloomin wasps!",September 2018,Sami Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189457-d645024-Reviews-Sami_Acropolis-Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0
"Great desserts, small but fierce venue","Again another great, but way more modern taverna than the rest in the area! Staff are fabulous and attentive and happy to make recommendations if you let them know what you like. Pricier than the other tavernas but the service is well worth it.",September 2018,Il Familia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g678734-d4354231-Reviews-Il_Familia-Sami_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great food, great service, great prices","Loved this place and it was my 2nd favourite taverna to visit. The food was delicious and so cheap. The staff are lovely and very patient and also didn't mind me trying out my bad Greek on them! For me the bonus was the gajillion cats that hang around. Might be off putting for some but the cats are mostly well behaved and wont jump up or anything. They just sit there longingly staring at you! This restaurant also has the BEST table covers in the whole of Sami, I meant to ask for one before leaving and totally forgot :-(",September 2018,Taverna Akrogiali,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g678734-d4892166-Reviews-Taverna_Akrogiali-Sami_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Its just a pretty pond really,This was relaxing to look at. The endless stream of dragon flies of all colours were epic and watching the shoals of fish was fun especially when the fish were jumping out of the pond to try and eat the dragon flies!,September 2018,Karavomilos Lake,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g8281993-d11547835-Reviews-Karavomilos_Lake-Karavomylos_Sami_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",attractions,3.0,3.5
VERY PRETTY BIG HOLE,"Lovely couple of hours spent mooching around the cave and taking pictures! Be warned - there are loads of steps into and out of the cave and they are pretty steep so not recommended for pushchairs or anyone with mobility issues or even heart issues as the steps are very steep. It costs 5 euros to gain entry. The first thing you notice is how cool it gets near the actual mouth of the cave. Dont let that fool you though, humidity is still super high inside and everything feels damp. The floors are VERY slippy to the point that carpet has been laid in places to walk on to avoid slippage. The carpet is soaking wet itself though! Im sure there were meant to be guides however we never encountered one and were left to wonder and explore on our own. Stalagmites and stalactites everywhere looking super awesome! Gift shop had nothing more than the general tat in any seaside gift shop on the island. There was nothing cave specific that I recall seeing. Definitely worth a look :-)",September 2018,Drogarati Cave,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g12963193-d3299709-Reviews-Drogarati_Cave-Chaliotata_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html,"Kefalonia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Num num num,"So... It's kinda grimy and greasy but the food is good and so cheap.

I'm not implying its dirty or unclean. It just feels greasy.

The food has as always been de list. I've never been ill and I will go there until something makes me not!
I kinda love it!",February 2018,Aladdins,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186378-d4923529-Reviews-Aladdins-Stoke_on_Trent_Staffordshire_England.html,"Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.0
"Average, Average, Average","First time visiting this place. Its not often I eat Thai food and i was rather excited. The first thing that surprised me was the fact that its a rather small space up some stairs! That I was not expecting!

Heaters dotted between tables and the fairly small triangular room was reminiscent of a council function room (I'm basing this on the ceiling tiles and carpet).

Although it was very busy when we arrived (we had prebooked) it was a nice change to not see people smooshed together uncomfortably and there was plenty of room between tables and around tables for the staff to whizz around delivering dishes.

We decided to try the set menu at £23 per head as it sounded like a bargain! We went Bangkok! This consisted of 1 mixed starter which was small and literally only 1 of everything each. Ok no problem. I can keep the space in my tummy for the mains! The starters were super hot, so freshly cooked although some of the items made me feel like i was eating the £1 oriental mix from Iceland. There were a selection of 3 main dishes and then a bowl of jasmine rice. I can honestly say the Thai Green Curry is the best ive ever eaten. Very tasty and creamy but not overpowering in coconut, salt, chilli.

The food was all very nice. But it also felt very generic. There was nothing outstanding, every dish we saw being delivered to tables had the obligatory shredded cabbage and modelled carrot on it!

I was disappointed I have to say, I expected more from the place. that's not to say it wasn't nice but it certainly wasn't value for money. I don't think the set menu was worth 23£ per person at all and infact had we ordered separately the same dished we may well have saved approximately £10!

The service was fabulous though, and everyone was very attentive clearing dishes and making sure the food was alright.

Id go again but maybe not for a special occasion.",January 2018,Blue Chilli Thai Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190819-d2419390-Reviews-Blue_Chilli_Thai_Restaurant-Newcastle_under_Lyme_Staffordshire_England.html,"Newcastle-under-Lyme, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0

WOWZERS! WHERE ARE MY EYEBROWS?!,"Well... this was as booking made by me for my boyfriends birthday. He had been once before 10 or so years ago but I was an utter virgin! So, let's not get it twisted... the tables seat a minimum of 6 I believe so no cosy cooking for a twosome. It didn't matter though. The theatrics of the chef were amazing! Starters first not cooked on the grill obviously! Then the main event! Holy cow... so much food I have never seen soo much food. All cooked deliciously. The best egg fried rice I've eaten in my whole 35*ahem* years! Seriously. Just do this. Staff are fabulous. Food is fabulous. It's just fabulous!

Olde Worlde yet ultra modern!,"This is a funny place. Essentially in the middle of nowhere between some woods and other properties! However it is utterly gorgeous inside and out.

Family run with 6 rooms and a large breakfast room its lovely and clean and welcoming. The owners were friendly and couldn't do enough for us.

We stayed in room 3 which was made up of 3 single beds. the only downside (and I say this loosely as it wasnt an issue really) was that the ceiling was slanted down one side. Beds were comfy with enough room to move around and boogie, TV on the wall, tea and coffee facilities and a 'help yourself' to the drinks in the fridge downstairs (noting what you had taken to your room of course). The room was full of lovely quote pictures and very country-esque. The bathroom was the highlight for me though, mainly the shower! It was EPIC! It not only had a rain head but also a hand held shower, and back massage shower and foot massage shower heads with a seat! This all sounds great til you get to the BUILT IN RADIO!! And light! Party in the shower? ohh hell yes!!! I loved the bathroom!

Breakfast was good, selection of fruits, cold meats, cheeses, yoghurts, breads and the offer of bacon and eggs too. Huge pot of coffee or tea with a jug of cream.

We have already booked to stay again next year for an event as it was so brilliant.

Adequate parking outside too :-) Love it!!",March 2017,B&B De Watering,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g641789-d7384238-Reviews-B_B_De_Watering-Lommel_Limburg_Province.html,"Lommel, Belgium",hotels,5.0,5.0
NICEST TRAVELODGE EVER!,Peterborough central Travelodge is your basic average Travelodge. Nothing less than you should expect from a Travelodge really. What made this trip for me was the reception staff - I encountered 2 of them. They were both amazing!! Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly helpful lovely lady who checked us in and went out of her way to make us feel comfortable. I had presumed it might be a one off however the man at reception upon checking out the following day was equally as helpful and friendly! Over and above what I would expect and I wish I could recall their names because they deserve a million pound bonus for both being so utterly fantastic! They are a credit to the company for sure!,July 2016,Travelodge Peterborough Central,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187045-d601526-Reviews-Travelodge_Peterborough_Central-Peterborough_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!,"I was not sure what to expect when I randomly booked a table via OpenTable. It had mixed reviews but it was near to the theatre I was going to and the price seemed reasonable. well, I was not disappointed!!!! We were 30 minutes early, NOT a problem for the staff who accommodated us straight away. The staff were all so friendly and attentive - nothing was too much bother or hassle - something which I found a little overwhelming purely because im not used to THAT level of service!! There was a good choice of food from either the set or a al carte menu and it came really quickly once ordered. The food was utterly delicious!!! I can think of nothing to complain about there at all!! The meat was juicy and beautifully cooked and tender and the rice and veges equally lovely. Despite the food coming fast we never felt rushed. Following the starters we were asked if we wanted the main straight away or wait a while. One of the staff overheard it was one of our party birthday and well, that prompted all the staff singing Happy Birthday and the dessert coming with candles in it!! The place itself is so cute and small upstairs but there is a downstairs although I think to get the ambiance of the place you need to be upstairs, its warm and cosy and fabulous!! I can not wait to go again and try something else off the menu!!! Plus the price is AMAZING for the quality or food, service and ambiance!",March 2015,Mediterranean Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1650736-Reviews-Mediterranean_Cafe-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
