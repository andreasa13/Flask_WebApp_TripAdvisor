Concise and informative tour,The host of our tour (Mario) spoke very good English and was very knowledgeable about the factory that we toured. We were able to book onto the tour on the day when most other companies had sold out of tickets. The factory itself was not exactly how we expected as there was very little original parts of the factory it had been all converted into a museum however it was still interesting and worth a visit if in the area!,April 2019,Schindler's Factory Museum Guided Tour in English,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g274772-d11991683-Schindler_s_Factory_Museum_Guided_Tour_in_English-Krakow_Lesser_Poland_Province_So.html,"Krakow, Poland",activities,5.0,4.5
Uncomfortable atmosphere,We came here for a night whilst in Athens last week and did not expect the atmosphere that we found there. Trip advisor reviews had been really good however when we entered all of the staff were making out with each other (at least 3 members of staff) rather than paying attention to the customers. Drinks were not cheap and the music was very weird like a deep house/ techno. As a 21 year old I normally like most clubs and bars however this place is for a very specific type of hipster/indie. Very odd.,April 2019,Booze,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d607851-Reviews-Booze-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5
Just come for one round,"City zen is a really cool rooftop bar with amazing views and heaters to keep you warm. we only felt the need to stay for one round as two cocktails came to €20+ so if you are planning on spending longer here you’re looking at a pricy night . Saying that, the cocktails were really impressive and the ones we had were covered in melted chili chocolate!

Only beach bar around,Bolivar beach bar is a really luxurious place to sit and eat or drink on the beach. It has an extremely relaxing atmosphere and is decorated really well. The service was really good however food here is very expensive and half a pint of beer was around €5/6 euros. Worth sitting down here maybe for one drink but avoid eating as you’ll be looking at €10 for a sandwich with fried that are extremely salty.,April 2019,Bolivar Beach Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g642168-d7193390-Reviews-Bolivar_Beach_Bar-Alimos_Attica.html,"Alimos, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Incredible food authentic cheap,"Best pizzeria I’ve come across since being in Italy. The prices are so low and so you would not expect such incredible quality there is such a huge juice of pizza and it is all made fresh in front of you and put into a traditional open wood burning oven! The pizza is absolutely huge and a marguerite is €2.50. I had a more adventurous one with salami, Gorgonzola, rocket and mozzarella and it was €5.50, I could not finish it!

"Cool bar , not cheap",Drunk Sinatra was a nice little bar with really cool swanky decor.

Good day out but expensive,The lake is easily accessible by the tour bus operators and is maintained very well by the staff. We did not eat at the restaurant or order drinks because they were very expensive. You pay €12 adult entry and €9 student entry and you have a lounger and parasol. The lake at this time of year is nice and warm enough to swim in however the little fish that eat your feet skin are very ticklish would recommend as this is a beautiful place only reason for not doing five stars is that for a family day out you are looking at a hefty price.,April 2019,Lake Vouliagmeni,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562635-d1783442-Reviews-Lake_Vouliagmeni-Vouliagmeni_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Vouliagmeni, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Great for special occasions,We came to sin athina on 29th /march for my boyfriends 21st birthday. The menu had a good range of food and although it was one of the pricier choices the linguine that i ordered was a very large portion. My boyfriend had the steak which was okay. it was slightly overcooked and only came with fries when it really needed some vegetable or salad side to make it a well rounded main. The halloumi starter was great and the wine wasn't expensive (starting at 15 euro a bottle). Service was great and so was the overall atmosphere. the views really are breathtaking and although it is quite cold in the evning at this time of year there are heaters to keep you warm.

Frozen food and bad service,"We came to Esperides on our holiday in athens on monday the 1st of April. At first everything was good with a lovely rooftop table and view ( only reason for not making a terrible review) The waiter was very good at first until he finished his shift maybe or disappeared somewhere. we were left up on the roof alone for over 40 minutes without service we had to go downstairs and search for staff to pay our bill, could have easily left without paying. the food was very basic and average it did not taste fresh. the muscles were very tasteless and tasted as though they were frozen, the sauce was very weak. The main was a Kalamaki which i believe was around 9 euro. we received one skewer of meat some rice which again did not taste fresh, perhaps microwaved, and some fries. It was disappointing to say the least. The only hood things were the view from our table and the drinks which were reasonably priced. Food and service were not good at all. it is not often that i write bad reviews but it felt neccessary here.",April 2019,Esperides,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d8021254-Reviews-Esperides-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,3.5

We spent Valentine’s here and I wasn’t sure whether it would be the fancy atmosphere I was looking for but it was lovely and made very special by the friendly and helpful stafff. The octopus skewers were to die for!! The tomahawk steak was also lovely although we didn’t realise the size of this €48 steak as it is not very clear on the menu with pricing written at “4 /hg” which we didn’t understand despite not being able to finish the feast the food and the atmosphere was lovely!!!,February 2019,Amo Bistrot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187871-d13010509-Reviews-Amo_Bistrot-Verona_Province_of_Verona_Veneto.html,"Verona, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5

"Lovely food and wine, slow service",This was a nice little place for a light dinner and glass of wine. The cold cuts and cheese platter we shared for €26 was lovely and plenty of food ( we couldn’t finish it) wine was also nice and fairly priced.

Good budget holiday for a young couple,"We are a young couple (20) who stayed here for a week at the start of June. After reading reviews we were concerned a little bit but for a 2 star hotel we were overall, pleasantly surprised. The people who were slating the hotel in the reviews were expecting too much for a budget hotel. We really enjoyed our week here and would 100% visit again.

Positives:
- Staff very friendly, helpful and hardworking. In particular Sandra on the front desk, Maria on the bar/restaurant and more whose names we can't remember
- Pool area was stunning with great views and access of the beach
- Food was okay, we never had any problems with any of it, but it depends how picky you are. Typical all inclusive english breakfast and mixtures of burgers, ribs, muscles, pork etc for lunch/dinner. The mexican night was really good with fajitas and nachos
- Cleaners came regularly on every other day and done a good job
- Good atmosphere, everyone was really nice and sociable. Entertainment was only bingo and quiz nights but Daniek on the nights worked well to make it enjoyable (we won champagne twice)
- Variety of facilities including sauna (not included), tennis, archery, yoga etc

Negatives:
- Bathroom in our apartment could have been cleaner, quite a few insects - pest killer needed
- Main reason we didn't give this more stars was due to the ending of the holiday. They cut off our all inclusive wristbands at 11am on check out despite our flight not departing till 10pm. This left us without drinks or food for the rest of the day even though we arrived at 7pm on the first day so we only had dinner that day. This upset a lot of people and there was a lot of moaning around the pool. However, obviously everyone else who was still on their holiday saw how ridiculous this was and were buying all the leavers drinks and food from the bar - knowing they were going to be in the same situation the following week. The irony is that we probably got more from the bar on this day than over the previous week as people kept coming up to us and offering stuff from the bar (so cutting off the bands was pretty much pointless and just ruined our impressions of the hotel). We've never experienced this on any other all inclusive holiday.

On a lighter note. It was a really good week for a budget holiday and we appreciate all the help the hotel staff offered. Thank you!",June 2018,Blue Sea Costa Teguise Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g659633-d291328-Reviews-Blue_Sea_Costa_Teguise_Beach-Costa_Teguise_Lanzarote_Canary_Islands.html,"Lanzarote, Spain",hotels,3.0,3.0

Great experience!!,Great experience we had an amazing time and it was a fair price for the excursion. Unforgettable memories. Only downside was That photos are very expensive and could be made more affordable but other than that it was great.,June 2018,Native Diving Lanzarote,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g659633-d2174387-Reviews-Native_Diving_Lanzarote-Costa_Teguise_Lanzarote_Canary_Islands.html,"Lanzarote, Spain",attractions,5.0,5.0
