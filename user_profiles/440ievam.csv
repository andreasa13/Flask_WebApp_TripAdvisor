Historical,Love the place and especially now that they're taking care more of the place..amazing beautiful place!,December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Rude servers,"We asked to switch place since a couple has left and we just came and sat down in an uncomfortable place. The server just immediately said no and said we need to do reservations and started placing reserved on the table. It's not a customer service for people who are greeks, it's such a shame. It's not my first time in this place and just that day I brought my greek husband with me and that's his first time experience with his greek people..",December 2019,A for Athens Cocktail Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2665318-Reviews-A_for_Athens_Cocktail_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0
Don't expect too much,"Well my first time to visit the place and since it's the best of the year I was looking forward to see all their festive decorations. So I wanted to go at the big place and didn't let me in cause I'm alone so they told me to go in their other place which has a small place, they don't tell on their page about how many place they have and which one a person or number of people can go...
Since i am alone and i smoke, i had to go out to have a cigarette, into my last cigarette I had to take my scarf going out with my coffee since it's breezy but i left my takeaway on my table, when i came back someone else has taken my place. I paid the 13euros of coffee and a plate of red velvet. I didn't want to make a scene but i told the lady that she could have asked me before she placed other people on my seat.... I was having a nice time but it really makes me sad how sometimes greeks they treat people without respect. My husband told me that I shouldn't pay for it since I was like being kicked out but because I don't want to be mean and I always believe in Karma, I paid anyway.",December 2019,Little Kook,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d9710322-Reviews-Little_Kook-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Disappointed,"I can't complain how beautiful the sea is but when I came with my family, we tried to find a empty sunbeds. Usually if its reserved they're putting covers in it. So we found one which was empty and when we're about to sit. A guy named Kostas told us that it's reserved and we can't sit whenever we want. Like seriously talking about customer service? Very poor and disrespectful. I am not sure maybe they are looking for people who looks rich and all that. But even in Mykonos or Santorini we were never treated this way. I feel bad for beach bars like this, you can't be good if your staff doesn't know customer service, may it be greeks or foreigners. Plus coffees came after an hour that we had to order again, as well as the sunbeds location the guy gave us doesn't have a small trash bin that usually it should have. Will never recommend neither come back to this place with staff like this.",August 2019,Zattero Seaside Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1191813-d7258175-Reviews-Zattero_Seaside_Bar-Fourka_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,"Fourka, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.0

Quick getaway,"4hrs 30mins drive from Athens, If you want to travel without taking the ferry. Love the place, more parking space, a lot of sun-beds, great restaurant with pool which is sea water (for kids to enjoy if the sea is not so calm), not so pricey, staff are friendly.The sea is such a beauty.",August 2017,Kathisma Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1786926-d3422036-Reviews-Kathisma_Beach-Agios_Nikitas_Lefkada_Ionian_Islands.html,"Lefkada, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Family dinner,"Arrived at the place with full of people, so we had to be in the waiting list before having dinner. We waited for 2 hours, luckily there's a cafe beside it which you can seat, have coffee, enjoy the sunset and nice view (if you come earlier) to wait for our place in the restaurant. It's windy because the place is quite in a higher place, but they offer blankets (you just have to ask where they put it). The restaurant is kind of expensive probably because it's a tourist spot, but then it has a great food and friendly staff. Great view and a great place to dine!",August 2017,Rachi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g12487010-d2436208-Reviews-Rachi-Exanthia_Lefkada_Ionian_Islands.html,"Lefkada, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Best so far,"Well I can say that this is the best stay in a hotel for me. Stayed in executive room, with a free access of executive lounge. Staff are very accommodating, food is very good and the rooms are cozy comfortable. Will make you want to come back and check-in again.

Funny how I think this is the third time I'm writing a review for this hotel. For tourists, it's better to find another hotel than this one.

Quick trip,"Close to the airport. Not so pricey. Great for tourists who doesn't mind about luxury hotels. Well if you are in a budget this is a great place to stay, train is a few minutes walk, costa is on the ground level of the hotel, they have a public bus of which you have to check the reception area for the timings, taxis are to order from reception because in the late night they are not visible in the area.",August 2017,Premier Inn Dubai International Airport Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d1631237-Reviews-Premier_Inn_Dubai_International_Airport_Hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,4.5

New year / Anniversary,"Spent too much money with the 2 rooms we occupied and the New Years event that wasn't fun because of all the hassle it caused, as well as the staff aren't well coordinated. No news even with the raffle they did, felt like we have wasted our money.
Had my foreign husband disappointed of the place when I thought was good since it has been a long time hotel.

Aside from that, Food was great and the F&B department was kind enough to always give us great place, warm smiles and delicious cakes because we're celebrating our anniversary at the same time!",December 2016,Diamond Hotel Philippines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298573-d306018-Reviews-Diamond_Hotel_Philippines-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,"Luzon, Philippines",hotels,2.0,4.5
Worth it,"Good location, Price is cheaper than any other 5stars in Manila for an Executive suite, Love the customer service of the staff, the hotel is very decent, security is tight, breakfast is great, executive lounge is the best that made my stay worth it! Keep it up and surely we'll come and to visit again!

Disappointed,"First of, we booked online 3months ago for the holiday. It's very difficult to get in touch with the hotel, even if all departments were copied in the email. Second, the buffet we booked online was not clear as when we arrived at the hotel the buffet is a snack buffet on the sign board when we expected a normal buffet. We had to change the new years eve party just to have a proper food, which took 3 calls before they can make a solution. Third, reception department are not genuinely nice, sure as hell you can see on their faces when they don't know what they are doing and being not polite and fake smiles and judgemental looks... Fourh, the bill went additional 1000usd higher which is a rip off! I would rather check in at City of Dreams or Shangrila than to stay here, never again we will book in this hotel! It's a wrong choice i have made and recommended to my husband who's having a vacation here in PH!",January 2017,Diamond Hotel Philippines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298573-d306018-Reviews-Diamond_Hotel_Philippines-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,"Luzon, Philippines",hotels,1.0,4.5
Worse,No separation of lanes. It's a rip off!! Don't buy rides all you can because if you go inside you are still going to pay in other activities! Very bad place of amusement park....,January 2017,Star City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298452-d2459009-Reviews-Star_City-Pasay_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,"Luzon, Philippines",attractions,1.0,3.5
Tiring day,"You have a full pass but wasn't able to manage the time for the shows, they should have programs to help the guests and not to waste money.

Too expensive,"I cannot say this is the best hotel choice we have made, it is too expensive, staff are not friendly, amenities we're okay, rooms been cleaned continuously during our 8days stay, the restaurant has a dress code like it is a fine and dining which is not, they are days that the food is nice and days that are not... Staff are nice because it's an expensive hotel but they don't really smile because they love their job... Some waiter are rude and to think that they are being rude to a local which means a greek, because some staff are not greeks, not being racists but some of the staff are really bad with service, they have to work that out because guests are paying so much money to have an awesome vacation.... Bad massage spa, they don't know how to do massage to be honest... Suite room is too expensive but it is not as big as I usually have in a suite room... Anyway the pool is nice but closes too early at 7pm... The Zakynthos town is 15-20mins....",August 2016,Lesante Classic Luxury Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g775851-d1453176-Reviews-Lesante_Classic_Luxury_Hotel_Spa-Tsilivi_Planos_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.5

Clean and clear water!!!,"The place is like a compound, unique elevator (teleriffic), staff are accommodating and always smiling, food is good but needs improvement with coffee. The hotel charges can be pricey and also i am surprised that not all rooms has Mini bar. Fantastic view from the room, although the room is a bit not spacious...

It's not the best but they managed to be consistent.,"Having a Suite room - Ocean view, the hotel gave a reasonable price. They have a kind and polite staff, they will do everything to satisfy their customer needs. The facilities somehow needs to refurbished but the services are good. The hotel has a comfortable and cozy ambiance, they also have cool activities, for kids too. The Ibiza night life with a laid back ambiance and cool activities. Although the beach is small, good only for soaking under the sun because they have a nice pool as well, but I'm not sure when or how they clean it. The island tours or city tours provided by the hotel is quite pricey, but for your convenience and you want hassle free time then don't mind the prices.",July 2015,Mövenpick Hotel Mactan Island Cebu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298461-d543035-Reviews-Movenpick_Hotel_Mactan_Island_Cebu-Lapu_Lapu_Mactan_Island_Cebu_Island_Visayas.html,"Mactan Island, Philippines",hotels,3.0,4.0

Pricey but it's worth it,"Having an Executive room, with free access to lounge for cocktails, unlimited use of laundry and etc. From facilities to amenities, you can't go wrong with the quality that they offer! Still my favorite hotel to relaxed and unwind. Staff are polite and kind. Best food. Best service. Everything!
