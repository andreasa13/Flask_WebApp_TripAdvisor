The worst flight I had in years!!!!!,"My flight was from Paris to Jeddah passing by Ankara. The Airport in Ankara is the worst airport ever! The lounge is so small with a little variety of food. I had a layover of 10 hours and this was the worst layover. I make more than 20 flights a year. I'm an elite member on skyteam and this was my first flight with a star alliance member. Turkish Airlines made it the worst.

In Ankara airport, they didn't let us go to the lounge as we are transit passengers. They made us wait for two hours on unconfortable chairs without internet or anything. The people doesn't speak english or understand what we are saying. Turkish Airlines never interfered to ensure the comfort of its passengers!

Finally as I reached Jeddah, my baggage didn't arrive on the same day (August 26, 2018). My flight arrived 8:15 am and I waited till 11 am in the airport which made me lose my working day and make the driver wait for almost 4 hours! Finally they told us no more baggage will arrive and I filed a complaint about my lost baggage. This is the first time I lose a baggage with an Airline.

After couple of days, no one from Turkish Airlines called to update me on the baggage status. I was calling the Jeddah Airport team every now and then which were so helpful. Turkish Airlines team was not helpful at all! I was sending them feedback on their online forum without any helpful reply. I had some important stuff that was lost and needed to buy some items instead! At the end I called Turkish Airlines after almost two weeks and no one from their side called me, their reply was to wait and they are still investigating! I was clear with them and said the only thing I need is my baggage.
This is any passenger's right when he trusts the Airlines and travels from one place to another. He should arrive safely to the destination with the baggage on time without any damages! Turkish Airlines failed in the last part!
On September 11, 2018 which is after 16 days of baggage delay they finally said the baggage was lost. The claims department decided to compensate only 950$ knowing that since day one I provided the Airlines with a detailed list showing my lost items which totals to more than 5000$!
Turkish Airlines have the worst customer service, bad staff, unreliable team, and they made my flight a nightmare! I advise anyone who gets attracted by the low prices of Turkish Airlines to pay more and take another flight with a more reliable Airlines since losing his baggage will make you lose more money than what you save on a flight!",August 2018,Turkish Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729174-Reviews-Turkish-Airlines,World,flights,1.0,4.0
