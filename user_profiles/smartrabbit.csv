Gives you the feeling of being in another world.,Best to hire a guide to take you there as then you can cut in line to buy your ticket--need to show your passport and get your picture taken. Spent the full day and still didn't see it all. These ruins are beautiful and are definitely worth a trip to Cambodia to see.,May 2016,Angkor Wat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297390-d317907-Reviews-Angkor_Wat-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",attractions,5.0,5.0
It's okay if you just want a place near the airport,"For the price, it's okay. I picked it because they had a free airport shuttle and the price was reasonable. Just needed some place to sleep as I had an early flight at Ohare the next morning. They offer free breakfast in the morning but I think I only had juice, coffee and a muffin.",September 2016,Best Western O'Hare/Elk Grove Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35945-d87766-Reviews-Best_Western_O_Hare_Elk_Grove_Hotel-Elk_Grove_Village_Illinois.html,"Elk Grove Village, Illinois",hotels,3.0,3.5
"Location good, price good but had some issues with service","Rooms are a bit dated but nice. For the most part service was good but I ran into a service issue. I had been in China for about a week already and was coming in from Shanghai. Having been walking around on brick, stone or asphalt for most of my trip, my back was hurting me pretty badly, so I went to the spa to get a massage. The price for a massage was $180 US dollars which was fine but when it was over, I wanted to charge it to my room and I was allowed to but was told that next time I needed to bring money. I walked from the building the spa was in to my building and I asked the desk if I had any messages. They told me I needed to pay for the massage before anything else--I'm used to other places where you settle that up when you check out--I had to go to my room and get my credit card to charge that. So other than making me feel like I was a dead-beat, everything was fine. I stayed at a Mercure in Chang Mai Thailand and had a wonderful experience so I tried them in China-- probably wont go with them again unless I go back to Thailand.",September 2016,Mercure Xian on Renmin Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298557-d589801-Reviews-Mercure_Xian_on_Renmin_Square-Xi_an_Shaanxi.html,"Xi'an, China",hotels,4.0,4.0
Nice little apartment in a good location.,Nice apartment in a good location. Subway metro station across the street. Lots of good restaurants within walking distance. Starbucks across the street. A few good noodle restaurants and a chuan chuan hot pot place nearby.

Got to see this if in China,To see the warriors lined up in the pits was amazing. I booked with Han Tang Tours to see the warriors. We went to 3 different pits and the banpo museum before. It was pretty crowded the day I went. One tip: I would spend a little extra money on a private tour as the general tours end up stopping at a ceramic factory and another shop for about 30 to 45 minutes each( seems like all tours buses and cars stopped here to shop)--you really only need a half day to see this.,September 2016,Han Tang Tour Shanghai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g308272-d2190711-Reviews-Han_Tang_Tour_Shanghai-Shanghai.html,"Shanghai, China",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great place for animal lovers,I booked this half day tour through Viator and was pleased. We left in the morning and it was still cool out. We did see a lot of pandas out as it was still cool in the morning so they weren't hiding. Also got to see the baby pandas in the nursery. Definitely worth seeing if you are in Chengdu.,September 2016,Giant Panda Breeding Research Base (Xiongmao Jidi),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297463-d457089-Reviews-Giant_Panda_Breeding_Research_Base_Xiongmao_Jidi-Chengdu_Sichuan.html,"Chengdu, China",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great way to taste local food other than walking down Muslim Street,"Met our guide Lu at the meeting point and proceeded to visit places that offered local food not found on Muslim street. We did end up in some of the back alleys around Muslim Street but for food we wouldn't normally see. All in all, a good way to spend a few hours and since I booked food tours in Chengdu and Beijing, I got a discount on the tour price.",September 2016,Lost Plate Xian Food Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298557-d7220597-Reviews-Lost_Plate_Xian_Food_Tours-Xi_an_Shaanxi.html,"Xi'an, China",attractions,4.0,5.0
