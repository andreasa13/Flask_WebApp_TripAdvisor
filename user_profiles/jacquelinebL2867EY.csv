So much to see and do,"The Intramuros is much more than just an old fort. If you love history, this is the place to go.
Fort Santiago has a museum dedicated to the hero of the Philippines, Jose Rizal. To truly appreciate that part, read up on him before you go to the museum. He was an amazing man.
Then the walls of the Intramuros are fascinating themselves. Be sure you go to the Baluarte de San Diego. It's a little bit of a walk, but worth it.
There are so many other things to see, too. I walked for five and a half hours and didn't see everything. If walking in the heat isn't for you, you can rent a pedicab for about a dollar an hour. The drivers know all the main sites, and it's a much easier way to see everything. In fact, they all thought I was a little crazy for wanting to walk.",October 2019,Intramuros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298573-d548076-Reviews-Intramuros-Manila_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,"Luzon, Philippines",attractions,5.0,4.0
Bogyoke Market is a must see,"I live in Yangon and frequently go to Bogo.(That's how it's pronounced.) It is a maze of every kind of shop you can imagine, from nice jewerly and art to cheap touristy items. Be sure you get off of the main aisle and don't forget to go upstairs - the prices are better. Make sure you bargain. If they will see you are a tourist, they will charge you double what it is worth. A trip to Bogo is an adventure no matter how many times you go.",May 2019,Bogyoke Aung San Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g19101426-d554501-Reviews-Bogyoke_Aung_San_Market-Pabedan_Yangon_Region.html,"Pabedan, Myanmar",attractions,5.0,3.5
"No food, but comfortable seats and gooe legroom","This was my first time to fly Scoot, but it won't be my last. It took a little getting used to the fact that you have too bring and empty water bottle and fill it after going through security and pack some food because the Scoot doesn't provide anything other than a seat. You have to pay for luggage, beyond a carry on, and everything you eat and drink. However, it was the planes were some of the most comfortable I've ever flown on, and I fly a lot. It was definitely worth it.",April 2019,Scoot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8728980-Reviews-Scoot,World,flights,4.0,3.0
"A beautiful, old world area","This area is best explored. Go off the beaten path, especially early in the morning before the other tourists are clogging the lanes and following their guides up and down the lanes. The homes are beautifully charming, and the little restaurants are set up right on the steps of the lanes.
The touristy section is full of shops with everything from the very nice quality (jewelry, textiles) to the average souvenirs. Spend time wandering, don't just buy the first thing you see. There are a wide variety of items available and a wide variety of prices.",April 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Explore the area,"Some of the best parts of the Square are in the area around it. Ancient churches which look primitive on the outside are treasures on the inside. Shops which aren't so touristy oriented are in the areas around the Square. Take time out for a Greek pizza or an ice cream, to eat as you walk.
If you want a real adventure (and do not have small children with you) go on a Sunday. Most of the other shops close on Sunday, and the people are out in full force. It's a sea of colors, languages, food, and everything you can imagine to buy (tourist wise).",April 2019,Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d265865-Reviews-Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Get there early,"If you don't take a guided tour, go to the museum first. If you don't, you won't truly appreciate what you are seeing. If you do take a guided tour, take one that just covers to Acropolis, then stay behind and take the time to really experience it. You need to take the time look around at the stones on the ground and absorb the Acropolis as a whole.
You need to be in the line for tickets by 7:45. It doesn't open until later, but if you are not one of the first people in, you will feel like an ant in an anthill going up to and wandering the Acropolis. Also, bring comfortable walking shoes with good treads. The stones are steep and can be very slippery.
Spring is a great time to go. It's not as hot so you can concentrate on what you are seeing and not the fact that you are roasting in the sun.
If you go with children or elderly people, keep in mind that visiting the Acropolis is a very physical adventure.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very dependable,"My hotel was ""off the beaten path"", on a little street and not easy to find. The Welcome Pickup driver was there to pick me up right on time. Then, because it was rush hour, he navigated the side streets to get me to the airport in very good time.",April 2019,Welcome Pickups,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d8609163-Reviews-Welcome_Pickups-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Mon State and Mon Village experience,"I went with Jack to the Mon State. It is always a joy to experience new aspects of Myanmar with Jack. The Mon State is rich in ancient culture and daily modern life. From 200 a two hundred year old monastery to the Death Railroad of the World War II era, every thing I experienced was diverse and fulfilling. The highlight of the trip was a home stay in a Mon village. I was one of the only Westerners that the villagers had ever seen, so this was definitely not a touristy area, but true Mon culture. With Jack I learned how they live in 21st century Myanmar. In many ways, this way of life hasn't changed much in 100 years.",November 2018,Green Season Travel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294191-d13602688-Reviews-Green_Season_Travel-Yangon_Rangoon_Yangon_Region.html,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",attractions,5.0,5.0
The real Myanmar with Green Seasons,"I have taken three tours with Jack, to Hpa An, Inle Lake and many points surrounding it, and from Mandalay to Bagan. I will never again book with another agency.
Jack is wonderful. He will make sure that you get to see the best of whatever area you wish to visit. He is very flexible. Review his itinerary, and if you wish he will make whatever changes you wish. Also, once you are out and about, he will is more than willing to change the itinerary based on your needs.
What I love most is that Jack lets you see the true Myanmar, not just the tourist sites. I have seen village life and pagodas and temples where virtually not westerners ever go. The people of Myanmar are so friendly and diverse. I love meeting them.
Thanks to Jack, I have had a chance to truly get to know this wonderful country .",April 2017,Green Season Travel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294191-d13602688-Reviews-Green_Season_Travel-Yangon_Rangoon_Yangon_Region.html,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",attractions,5.0,5.0
