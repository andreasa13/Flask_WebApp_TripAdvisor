Amazing,"Long walk, but worth it. Gigantesque. An early morning walk to the Acropolis is better as there is less tourists and queue for tickets",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent Indian Food,"Value for money, good portions, very good service. Small, but cosy. For muslim travelers looking for halal options, this place is great. You have a broad veg menu, prawn and their lamb is halal.",January 2020,BabaJi Indian Food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10700222-Reviews-BabaJi_Indian_Food-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Outstanding Stay,"Excellent stay at Electra Athens Hotel. The hotel is lively, rooms are clean and well maintained, with deluxe amenities. The breakfast buffet is on the last floor, providing nice view of the Acropolis. Staff are polite and cheerful. Fofi at the reception and Eric at the breakfast resto were just amazing. They make your stay special. Eric even accommodated us earlier for the breakfast due to our flight schedule. Thank you Eric and Fofi.

The location on Ermou street is a plus for travelers. Ermou is the pedestrian shopping street of Athens, and you have a variety of dining options. If you are looking for halal options, Babaji Kitchen is around the corner. The hotel is walking distance to the main tourist attractions: Acropolis, Monastiraki, Syntagma Square, Panathenaic Stadium and Plaka. Staying there, you save time and transport costs.

Keep up the standard, we will definitely come back.",January 2020,Electra Hotel Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228883-Reviews-Electra_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0

The Amazing Cave Hotel Experience,"The best choice we could have made for our winter stay in Capadoccia. The hotel gives you a wonderful feel of a rustic lifestyle with all the comfort you may get from a 4-star hotel. Great beddings, amenities and rooms with wonderful views. The hotel is 5-10 mins walking distance to the sunset view (uphill walk) and 5 mins to all the restaurants. The breakfast spread is reasonable with some typical turkish breakfast options. The staff are very friendly. Ilhan, the guest relations manager is excellent and always ready to answer our queries from our reservation date (note we booked via booking.com). We booked our tours via the Ilhan.",January 2019,Anatolian Houses,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297983-d622284-Reviews-Anatolian_Houses-Goreme_Cappadocia.html,"Goreme, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5

"Excellent Cafe, friendly staff","Mado Cafe in Canakkale is amazing. Excellent range, from french pastries, savouries and desserts to Turkish specialities. We have been to the other Mado in Istanbul, but the one in Canakkale is special, calmer with better customer service. Highly recommended.",January 2019,Mado,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297979-d8259901-Reviews-Mado-Canakkale_Canakkale_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Canakkale, Turkey",restaurants,5.0,4.0

"Excellent hotel, central location","Best place to stay in Canakkale. The hotel is only 5 mins drive from the airport and 2 mins walk to the ferry port. There are eateries close to the hotel. The staff are very friendly, kind and helpful. The breakfast spread is good. The Mado resto attached to the hotel is a definite plus point.",January 2019,Artur Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297979-d667674-Reviews-Artur_Hotel-Canakkale_Canakkale_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Canakkale, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5
Historical and Cultural Landmark,"Within 5 mins walking distance from the blue mosque. Besides its architecture, the Hagia Sophia is a historical and cultural landmark of Turkey.
It takes around 1.5 hrs to 2 hrs to visit and try to visit before noon to avoid the crowd.
No need for guided visit as there are audios in different languages available",February 2018,Hagia Sophia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293974-d294497-Reviews-Hagia_Sophia-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",attractions,5.0,4.5
The place to be,"Richmond is a very nice and well maintained hotel right on Istiklal Street. Rooms are clean and well equipped. The staffs are all very kind, hospitable and every ready to help. Serkan at the reception is an amazing person with a very happy attitude, which is all you need when you are on holiday. The availability of connecting room is a definite plus if you are travelling with family. It was always a pleasure to meet him and share a few words. If you stay more than 3 days (as was the case for us), the lack of variety of the breakfast can be an issue. But a breathtaking view from the restaurant.

The hotel is 2 mins walk from Sishane metro station and the Tunel which a plus.

Istiklal Caddesi is the place to be, and Richmond is the best possible option :)",February 2018,Richmond Istanbul,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293974-d295059-Reviews-Richmond_Istanbul-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5

Value for Money,"The hotel is centrally located - about 5 mins drive from the airport, right opposite the Deira City Centre mall. The metro station is less than 5 mins walk away.
Check in staff are highly efficient - check in and check out process is very smooth.
Breakfast is decent for a budget hotel",July 2017,Ibis Deira City Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d1173922-Reviews-Ibis_Deira_City_Centre-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,4.0

Good experience,"Very nice hotel within 10 mins walking distance from the Petronas towers. The hotel was being renovated during our visit - so it was a bit dusty. But staff quickly came to clean.
The hotel lobby is quite crowded.

Very bad service,"This was the worst hotel experience, grouping our experience in Paris, UK, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Malaysia, and ourselves coming from an island of 5 star resorts. It is our 2nd time at the residence because it was a near perfect experience in 2015. We had to wait for 3 hrs to get the 2 bedroom apartment as it was not ready yet. This went far beyond the check in time of 2 pm. The staff at the front desk were extremely unprofessional both for check in and check out. Mr Zahid seemed to have an issue understanding clear English on the Accor contract while Mr Hesham, the Egyptian was overly arrogant in his attitude. The bellboys and the room service staff were more polite and trained than the front desk staff. Ibis staff are more polite than the 4 star Pullman’s. Incredible. We lost all the trust in the Accor brand in general. We asked to meet the manager, who never came! No wonder the hotel is run this way, afterall then.",January 2017,Pullman Dubai Creek City Centre Residences,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d7229651-Reviews-Pullman_Dubai_Creek_City_Centre_Residences-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,2.0,4.5
