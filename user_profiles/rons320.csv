Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art,"Although the collection is not really large they have a few very good paintings, mostly 19th and 20th century. Terrific early Klimt canvas, Munch, Magritte, Chagall, Dali, Ernst, a couple of good Van Goghs,. Also they have one painting by Pavel Tchelitchev on display, albeit only one even though they have a few more in the vault. Old masters are represented by Hals, van Dyck, Goya. The American section has a couple of Andrew Wyeth paintings, Sargent. The only problem they keep the surrealists in glassed frames and the light reflects so badly in the room that the colors and the paintings are difficult to see (thus 3 stars).",April 2021,Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33804-d106102-Reviews-Wadsworth_Atheneum_Museum_of_Art-Hartford_Connecticut.html,"Hartford, Connecticut",attractions,3.0,4.5

Sanibel Island Northern Beach,I'm not sure if the parking regulations are the same throughout the island as we've been to this beach but Sanibel Island Northern Beach but if they are you'd better off flying to the French Riviera. It's $5 an hour and strictly enforced. So if you plan on spending a full day at the beach you will tap a bill for $40-$50 for parking fees alone. Besides the beach itself can be described as mediocre at best. We stayed in Sarasota and decided to explore Sanibel. It turned out to be a complete waste of time and money. Sarasota and St Pete beaches are so much better it's not worth the trouble of driving to Sanibel.,March 2021,Bowman's Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34616-d265565-Reviews-Bowman_s_Beach-Sanibel_Island_Florida.html,"Sanibel Island, Florida",attractions,2.0,4.5

Fairfield Inn & Suites Cincinnati North/Sharonville,"Except for the lobby the hotel is super dated. Old elevator, old carpets, old bathrooms with cracked sinks, old A/C. We had a double room which was fairly clean and seemed to have a more or less fresh coat of paint but the blue and orange combination of colors wasn't very inspiring. Breakfast was strangely dispensed. There were three couples in front of us trying to register for breakfast or something of the sort, and the process looked so tedious that we left with coffee only. But the strangest thing happened around 6 pm when someone knocked at our door, and while I was approaching it to open he opened our door with his key. The latch stopped it, the man apologized (happened to be a polite guy!), and when I looked into the peephole I saw him opening the door of the room across the hall and walking into that room where someone else was present.

Very poor sound insulation as the noise from the highway traffic could be heard all night. Free breakfast was a mendacious claim as there was practically no breakfast, only yogurt and coffee. To be fair we came down for breakfast pretty late, shortly after 8, but I have a strong suspicion that even at 6 am the feast of King Solomon it was not.

It's more of a country house with a small private art collection but what makes it exceptional is the way those impressionist paintings are presented. I can't say if the curators and technicians used a scientific approach here but the method of lighting they employ produces a phenomenal effect. The paintings in question, definitely the highlights of the entire collection, namely: Monet's haystacks (2) and landscape; Degas pastel and pink ballerinas; and a portrait by Manet make a viewer redefine the idea of a masterpiece.

Fairfield Inn & Suites Boston Cambridge,"The hotel is pretty good, modern building, clean room (although not very spacious), nice friendly staff, but the area it's located in is somewhat strange. It's not a place where you would dream of taking a walk. Breakfast was covid-style, so I can't comment on it. They have a good parking site (paid).

But the latter happened to be a few hundred yards further down the road so we stopped at Doc Ponds. The half chicken Vermont style was really good. They have a decent selection of beer.

"This church is in Marcapata, not in Cusco!","This small rural church is in Marcapata, not in Cusco. In fact it's 3-4 hours and 200 km away from Cusco.

Our lobsters were wrapped in an old newspaper but we found it out only when we opened the package at our picnic site, absolutely disgusting. No napkins or crackers were provided.

Chapel Rock,"If you drive there bear in mind that the 5-mile road leading to the site from H-58 is a dirt road with plenty of potholes. So plan on negotiating it thru a cloud of dust with an average speed of about 10 mph. The GPS directions are incorrect (we used our car GPS and Google - both with the same problem). The right fork where it directs you to go is closed. We decided to try it on foot only to turn back after a hundred yards as we realized it wasn't a good idea. So take a left fork if there are no cars parked along both sides of the road. Otherwise find a good spot to park and proceed to the parking lot on foot : it's good for about 4 dozen cars, you're lucky to find a spot if someone just left or if you managed to come in among the first few dozen visitors. So on July 4th if you're not there around 6 am perish the thought, just find a good spot and walk. It's less than half a mile from the fork to the parking lot.
At the parking lot you'll find a map stand with all points of interest and trails.

Lomen Stave Church,"Getting to the church is a bit tricky even though one can see the church from the road. There's a no-entry sign at the entrance to the dirt road leading to the church and a small plate says specifically ""For Lomen Stavkyrkje"". So you have to use the small parking lot at the intersection of E16 and Ellestadvegen and proceed to the church on foot. There was no visible path off this dirt road leading directly to the church as the field in front of it is all grass about 2-foot tall, but this dirt road takes you to a barn with a ""Private"" sign posted on it. The path to the church is right behind the barn.

The church was closed at the time of our visit but you can open the gates to walk the grounds. There are magnificent carved portals and a stand-alone bell tower.

There is another entry for this attraction on TA titled ""Lomen stavkyrkje."" This is a third or fourth time I have to post this review as TA editors, being the lazy jackasses that they are, prefer to delete my review instead of merging identical entries. Also, on a number of occasions they had deleted my reviews for not adhering to their standards even though some of those reviews were marked as helpful by other TA members.
