Well the biscuit tasted like a pilsbury can biscuit and looked like it. The grits was instant but a step up from the microwave ones. The pancake was boxed mix. It’s a cute place and has so much potential but it’s not homemade for sure. If you’re passing through the area there isn’t much competition so stop in try it maybe lunch or dinner.
