Perhaps the best service ever,My husband and I came to Bistro L’Hermitage for our anniversary and we were not disappointed!! The service was impeccable; perhaps the best service I have ever had at a restaurant (and I’ve been to many). The food was delicious. We shared a Caesar salad for an appetizer and for our mains we both had the scallops (they were massive U10’s seasoned to perfection). The wine menu was just the right length and the desserts were scrumptious. Exactly what we needed!! We will absolutely be returning.,April 2021,Bistro L'Hermitage,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58329-d1036022-Reviews-Bistro_L_Hermitage-Woodbridge_Prince_William_County_Virginia.html,"Woodbridge, Virginia",restaurants,5.0,4.5

"Go for the margaritas, stay for the tacos","I am a Portland native, but haven’t lived in town for ... many years. So sad. SO, when I come home for a visit, I always plan ahead to the food spots I want to hit! Bird and Co. has been on my list since it opened (one of the owners is a friend from high school)!! The food and drinks absolutely lived up to the hype! I had the blood orange margarita (swoon), elote, chicken taco and tofu taco. Everything was so good and the service was fantastic to boot!!

Thai in an upscale strip mall,"After an afternoon at the zoo we were starting to get hungry and decided to go with this local Thai place. Due to Covid restrictions, I called ahead to ensure that they did have a dine-in seating option (they did). When we arrived there was no dining room in sight so I asked again to make sure I had not misheard the woman on the phone. She pointed to a single table in the corner by the window that was not able to be seen from the front walk-in area. I said okay, thank you. We sat. We ordered. It wasn’t spectacular (two orders of fried rice, one pad Thai and one mixed filling dumpling). There was no kids menu (we didn’t have high hopes for that anyway), and we had two kids with us. The service was very good, so kudos for that!",September 2020,Paragon Thai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d3722753-Reviews-Paragon_Thai-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"Great food, great service!","My daughter and I came here for a mid-week lunch and loved it! I believe I came here once, years ago, but didn’t remember how it was. The food was great!

A lovely path through the trees,I brought my daughter here as part of a long morning walk we were taking. She loved the lookout tower where she could see the water and the birds.

Family memories,"I brought my daughter here for breakfast while we were on vacation; for me it is pure nostalgia. I grew up coming to Rehoboth with my family every summer and my grandparents used to take all of the kids out for a special breakfast one morning and it was truly just the best time. I think my daughter enjoyed herself, despite the times being quite different.

"Great service, delicious crab cake!",I brought my daughter here for dinner while we were on vacation and she had a blast!

You get what you pay for (perhaps less),"When we arrived, the lady who checked us in was very pleasant and informative. That’s about where the pleasantries ended. Our room was dirty (like bits on the carpet, splatters on the walls, foggy old mirror, etc.). The shower curtain didn’t even fit the full length of the shower, yikes. The beds were like rocks and the covers were sparse. I will give kudos for a great air conditioner and hot water.

The hype is real!,"After a trip to the aquarium, this was my one and only request! I’ve been wanting to come here for the longest time and it did not disappoint!!!

Rapid delivery; lacks flavor,"We ordered delivery from Dok Khao tonight and I will say, the time between placing the order and the delivery, was astonishing. SO FAST. I will give huge kudos for that (and for order accuracy). That’s where the compliments kind of end. For the $60 we spent... we really didn’t get much food in the way of portion or flavor. Wonton soup was bland, ‘fried rice’ was bland, pad Thai needed more sauce/flavor, and the wings were flavorful, but there were only 5! The healthy rolls were okay.
I think some day in the future we would try for dine-in once all the Covid stuff is gone.",July 2020,Dok Khao Thai Eatery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58329-d19842693-Reviews-Dok_Khao_Thai_Eatery-Woodbridge_Prince_William_County_Virginia.html,"Woodbridge, Virginia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Disappointed,"Y’all. I was so psyched to go here and get a milkshake. The first time I tried to go I was informed that it was going to take over an hour to make a milkshake, what?
So I left. Here I am, two months later trying again. I judged by the line out front that they were actually producing milkshakes and the like, so I got in line. The special shake was some ode to 4th of July, cherry lime with a donut on it? Ick.
So I ended up ordering two milkshakes (normal flavors; strawberry and a mint chip for my husband and daughter, respectively) and a simple chocolate/vanilla twist in a dish with hot fudge and sprinkles.
By the time the boy, who was clearly exhausted from running orders, shuffled his way over to our car, the ice cream was at least half melted (maybe more) and mine was only vanilla. I know they were busy, but come on, serving melted, incorrect orders...
I don’t think we’ll be back.",July 2020,The Battlefield Country Store,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60824-d11728981-Reviews-The_Battlefield_Country_Store-Fredericksburg_Virginia.html,"Fredericksburg, Virginia",restaurants,2.0,4.5
"Great pizza, poor customer service","I gave four stars based on the actual pizza (guys, it’s delicious.). However, the service is sub-par. I called and placed my order on a Tuesday at 4pm (as it is a 45 minute drive without traffic) for one cheese pizza and three slices of the monthly special — which the guy promptly told they were out of. I was so disappointed because I was looking forward to the Bruschetta. I asked if they had anything to replace it; he said no. I said ok, then just the cheese. He said it’ll be ready at 5pm. When I walk in to pick it up at 4:55pm, I see up on the board “Chef’s Kiss,” which was roasted peppers,
Olives and onions.... hmmm... I thought there were no other alternatives since the bruschetta special was out?? ARGH! Anyway - I asked the girl at the register how long it would be to add 2 slices of that to my order (that should have already been done, mind you), she said “4-5 minutes,” I said okay cool.
25 MINUTES LATER a guy finally calls my name. This isn’t cool. I know how good this pizza is, which is why I drive so far just to get it every now and again, but darn, that is just poor customer service.",July 2020,Benny Vitali's Pizzeria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60824-d7207994-Reviews-Benny_Vitali_s_Pizzeria-Fredericksburg_Virginia.html,"Fredericksburg, Virginia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"If I lived closer, it would be dangerous!","Ya'll. This place is legit bbq in the Northeast. First, our hostess turned waitress, was AWESOME. The thing I loved the most was her personality and honesty; she said she never had to fake it there because she just LOVED her job and the atmosphere. That really speaks to the kind of establishment this is. Now, the food. Literally everything was delicious. I ate until I physically couldn't anymore. I did the smoked chicken platter with cole slaw, corn bread and beans. SCRUMPTIOUS. My daughter had the honey garlic chicken wings and she is PICKY; she ate like it was her last meal. No kidding.

Wonderful breakfast!,"My mom was itching to take my daughter and I here for breakfast and I didn't understand why until we started eating - yum! What a fantastic selection of breakfast and lunch options and with great service to boot! I had the eggs, country ham, toast, and green tomatoes. My daughter had a pancake (SO good) and mom had two eggs, bacon and potatoes. All of the food was cooked to perfection and delicious; sans the friend green tomatoes, but that was my fault, not theirs - I am a green tomato snob who had been living in the south for years and come on, this is NH, what was I thinking!

Interesting placement; very good food,"I had lunch here with an old friend a couple of weeks ago and was not disappointed! The restaurant itself is basically in the lobby of the hotel, but don't let that sway you. The atmosphere was really comfortable and cozy. The service was a little slow, but the food was quite good.

"Great, friendly service","We came here for dinner (mom, myself and my daughter) and had such a lovely time. Our server (Sarah, I believe her name was), was so pleasant and quick. We ordered egg rolls and wonton soup to start. I'll be honest, the wonton wasn't the best, but it was hot and on a cold night that was just what I needed to warm me up. My mom liked the egg rolls and my daughter got edamame (her favorite!). For main dishes we ordered shrimp and broccoli, shrimp friend rice and kung pao chicken.

Love the choice between duck pin and regular bowling!,"My daughter and I came here after we couldn't get a lane earlier in the day elsewhere, and what a great decision it was! My daughter is still young enough to not truly understand the skill of bowling and needed the bumpers and the little balls. This was such a great activity for her. We had such a great time and it was wonderful that we had the option to bowl for as little as 30 minutes - with young kids' attention spans, this is fantastic.

Fun and food all in once place!,"The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 was for the outrageous wait time for a lane as well as the price; I realize, the establishment has no control over the wait time (it just shows how popular they are!), but the price is a little steep.
My daughter and I came up for a visit to my hometown and decided to meet up with some friends here for a quick game and some eats. We ended up only eating, but that was okay. This was more about spending quality time catching up so we didn't care. My daughter was disappointed about not being able to actually bowl, so we ended up going to another alley so she could bowl afterwards.

Overpriced for what you get,"My girlfriend raved about this place and said we had to take the kiddos here for pumpkin picking and activities, so of course, I obliged. Now, usually it's just us an our kids during weekday excursions, but this time the dad's joined in due to it being a holiday (Columbus Day). My husband is highly critical of any other pumpkin patch/fall activities because he grew up going to Cox Farm (if you're not familiar with Virginia; Cox Farm is located in northern VA - think DC/NOVA type of people, and Belvedere is more 'southern,' if you will), so he compared this farm to Cox farm and was underwhelmed both by the price paid for what we actually got to do/experience and just the place as a whole. There were some decent activities for kids (slides, corn pit, small animal feeding area, go karts), but the pumpkin patch pricing was a little ridiculous. We paid (with a military discount) over $17 per person (this includes kids over 2) AND you still had to pay $.69/lb for your freaking pumpkin! That's outrageous. Where I grew up in New England, the price of admission to a place like this covered you walking away with one pumpkin.
Next time, we'll go to Cox.",October 2019,Belvedere Plantation,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60824-d10682302-Reviews-Belvedere_Plantation-Fredericksburg_Virginia.html,"Fredericksburg, Virginia",attractions,3.0,3.5
"A tad crowded, but fantastic table service","My family came here for my grandmother's 90th birthday celebration. We had a large party, so of course we had made a reservation well in advance and they were adequately prepared, which I appreciate greatly at restaurants. Our server was very attentive and helpful with suggestions on the menu. The sommelier was also lovely and helpful when we were considering which wine to pair with our meals. For the most part we ordered a little of everything and shared quite a bit. Everything that I tasted was very good (casesar salad, gnocchi, pork chop, bolognese). The desserts were also very good; the chocolate salame was great!

Top 3 pizza places ever,"There is not one thing at Dewey's that isn't phenomenal. All of their salads, apps and pizzas are so, so good.

Definite hidden treasure!,"This place is underneath a retirement home (or something of the sort), but you'd never know it! It is quintessential Chinese cuisine with flair.

Brunch is a must,"My cousins and I came here while visiting our family in Cincinnati (it's just a quick trip across the river) because our aunt said it was supposed to be quite good. She had heard correctly! This place was great. The actual restaurant is on the smaller side, but they have adequate seating inside and out to make for a great operation. We came for brunch and were not disappointed; the cocktails were creative and strong, the doughnut ball appetizer was hot, sweet and delicious, and all of the mains were perfection. Two of us had the fried chicken sandwich, which to be perfectly honest was not super heavy in the 'fried' aspect, it was perfection with a tiny bit of heat. One cousin ordered the breakfast sammy and adored it and the other ordered french toast - also a delight.

Cute little place with HUGE salads!,"My longtime friend and I came here for a little mid-week date with our two kiddos and it was a great choice. The menu had a lot of different options and the kitchen was very gracious about our allergy requests. We ordered the appetizer of soft pretzels (two good sized pretzels!!), which were delicious and kept the kids satisfied while we waited for our entrees. My friend and I ordered salads, which as my title says, were humongous!! I had the cobb and it was good (could have used a bit more chicken, but overall very nice).

Second review. Not a good one.,"The first time I visited the Tuscan Kitchen (last year) I had a very nice dinner and wrote a lovely review. This time...HORRIBLE. I'm going to chalk it up the fact that it was Mother's day (we had a reservation made several weeks in advance) and they overbooked themselves and were perhaps under staffed. That is the only logical reasoning I could find for the horrendous service we had. We had an 1130 reservation...seated at 1150...server didn't come to our table (in fact, they weren't even sure who our server was for a good 10 minutes) until 1215...we placed our order...waited waited waited for a measly basket of bread that came at 1230... food arrived at 1:10.... it was okay (thank goodness or I would have given this a 1 star instead of 2)... we scarfed it down because we were starving and promptly left.
I was really taken aback during this visit and I hope they have learned from this experience not to book 800 (yes, 800, our server told us that is how many reservations they had scheduled for Mother's Day) reservations on the same day. I know money is money, but if you're going to lose future customers because you are greedy...not a good plan.",May 2019,Tuscan Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46209-d12210605-Reviews-Tuscan_Kitchen-Portsmouth_New_Hampshire.html,"Portsmouth, New Hampshire",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Ya'll...GO!!!!,"So the title of my review may say ya'll (because i've been living in the south now for about 6 years and simply cannot help it), but I grew up in Portland, ME and for all my New Englander's and for any travelers heading that way... you must stop at Wicked Mini Donuts. The donut itself is moist, tender and full of flavor. Then they add toppings galore (I think they offer somewhere between a dozen - 16 different types of donuts).

Wear your walking shoes!,"I believe this is a little overpriced for what it is, but it is very neat to see all of the historical pieces. If you want to see the museum in its entirety, be prepared to spend several hours touring the building. It gets quite busy but does have many rooms and exhibits to see, so people can spread out.

I was pleasantly surprised, due to the previous reviews. I ordered the Greek pasta and thought it was quite good. We also had tzaziki, sweet peppers filled with cheese, and a hot cheese. The sweet peppers were one of the best things I ate during my whole trip, so don't pass this place up!",April 2019,Roka Kafeneio Ouzeri,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d1127846-Reviews-Roka_Kafeneio_Ouzeri-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Recommendation from our resort did not disappoint,"This place was recommended to us by our beloved receptionist from the Elea resort - she said ""do you love seafood?"" we said ""YES"" she said ""well then you must go to Argo!"" So we came! She was completely correct - YUM! We ordered the frutti Di mare, spicy feta, honey cheese bread, and more! Everything was so delicious and the service was pretty great too. The only downer was that they were out of straight Assyrtiko wine and we had to settle for a blend, but overall, so great.",April 2019,Argo Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d1105505-Reviews-Argo_Restaurant-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
The man behind the counter pulled us in!,"The gentleman working behind the gelato cooler was just joking around with us and said come in come in, so we did! Holy moly, the baklava gelato was one of the best i've ever had! It was creamy and tasted just like a baklava! I also opted to get it on top of a waffle, because...why not? You must come here! It's a little hidden on a side street, but just hop off the main path by the square with the church and you won't miss it!",April 2019,Solo Gelato,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d14055387-Reviews-Solo_Gelato-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Rooftop view over the Caldera,"We happened upon this restaurant by accident, really. Strolling along the main walkway in Oia looking for a place to have dinner and this caught our eye(s). The view was phenomenal (a little cloudy, but beautiful) and the food and drinks were very good. We shared everything; tzaziki, fried calamari, pepperoni pizza; carbonara; cheese salad.",April 2019,Flora Comfort Cuisine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d3381203-Reviews-Flora_Comfort_Cuisine-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wine tasting in a very cool setting,This was our third and final stop on our wine tour in Santorini and by the time we had arrived we felt that we had become pretty good judges of Santorini wines. We enjoyed the tasting and pairings with the Greek food samples (the largest of all the samples we had tried that day!). The Vinsantos (spelling likely off) at this winery was my favorite of the 3 we had tried that day (it was a 2012 I believe; right in the middle of the two other ages we had tried).,April 2019,Artemis Karamolegos Winery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g8043198-d2178679-Reviews-Artemis_Karamolegos_Winery-Exo_Gonia_Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Crazy beautiful view over the port,"This winery was our second stop on our wine tour and we were blown away (almost literally, it was quite windy) by the view over the port. The winery is not only incredibly neat architecturally, but the history behind its setup is outstanding. The wines were crisp and fresh; the Greek food samplings were paired beautifully. We would absolutely encourage a visit here!",April 2019,Venetsanos Winery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1191887-d8155261-Reviews-Venetsanos_Winery-Megalochori_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
First stop on our wine tour,"This winery is not only beautiful, but full of history and great tasting wines! We were here on a wine tour with the Santorini Wine Adventure company and it was awesome! This was our first introduction to Assyrtiko (spelling is likely off) wine and Graviera cheese. Talk about game changers! We are now on a mission to find both of these items in the USA! Definitely worth a visit :)",April 2019,Boutari Winery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1191887-d243148-Reviews-Boutari_Winery-Megalochori_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Dreamy breakfast views,"You walk through this charming doorway from the pedestrian walkway down a flight of stairs, built right into the side of the coast, to breathtaking views of the Aegean Sea. It feels like you're sitting in a photograph; it's that beautiful. The breakfast menu had an array of choices - all Greek! You really cannot go wrong.

Phenomenal. We're coming back ASAP.,"I'm going to attempt to rave about this resort (and its staff) without writing a novel. We (myself, youngest cousin, closest cousin in age and his wife) arrived at the Elea around 0730 after a very early flight from Athens; we were greeted by Konstantina (who would soon become our favorite resort staff member and for the duration of this review I will refer to as K) and offered coffee in the lounge/restaurant (despite being exceedingly early for our 1400 check-in time) as well as the courtesy to leave our bags in the back of the office while we went off and explored for the morning/early afternoon before check-in. When we did check in, K showed us to our rooms and described all of the amenities. The rooms were very chic with little lofts that housed the beds upstairs. We were brought complimentary wine and cheese platters, which we enjoyed out front of our suites by the Jacuzzi. We decided to dine at the resort the first evening and were so pleased by our sever (who would soon become our second favorite staff member, unfortunately we did not catch his real name, but we do know he was from Albania and so I will refer to him as A) and his wonderful spirit. The food was quite good as were the cocktails.
We stayed for 4 days, and truly every single moment we were at the resort and needed ANYTHING - be it an extra blanket, bottle of water, restaurant reservation, you name it - K & A were there. (At one point I asked them if they ever sleep because they were always available - ha ha). Honestly, if you're going to Santorini, you must stay here. Well kept rooms, spa, infinity pools, restaurant, the best staff ever..... just saying. We are planning on returning back to the Elea with our entire family and just booking the whole resort :).
To the general manager/owner.... please give Konstantina and the sweet blonde gentleman from Albania our praises (and maybe a raise? :)) THEY ROCK!",April 2019,Elea Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482941-d7621197-Reviews-Elea_Resort-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
YUM! Gelato for days,This gelato was conveniently located across the way from our hotel and was a no-brainer for dessert on the way home from dinner our first night. They offered a ton of flavors and all of the ones we tried were rich and delicious.

Fun cocktails - smoking prevents a 5 star..,"We were walking around before dinner and decided to stop in for a cocktail. This was such a funky little joint and had a great list of awesome sounding drinks (cue the Alice in Wonderland)! We were served promptly upon ordering and were delighted with our drinks...and then... SO MUCH SMOKE in such a little space. This was annoying on two levels - we were surrounded by smokers in a small space AND there was a sign that blatantly said No Smoking. So, make your own call, it's definitely a cool place, but be prepared to deal with the smokers.",April 2019,Kimolia Art Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2578878-Reviews-Kimolia_Art_Cafe-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Simply amazing,There is no way you can come to Athens and not visit the Acropolis! It's a simple hike (once you can actually purchase a ticket and be admitted; that was the one negative I have about the visit to this historic site - we waited in line forever...why? No rhyme or reason).

Great for breakfast/brunch outdoors,"This was the first restaurant I had the pleasure of eating at during my trip to Greece. The service was slightly slower than I expected considering we were the only table at that time, but aside from that everything was great. Freshly squeezed orange juice, a variety of breakfast choices, and kind service. I had the chicken/pita dish, my cousin and his wife both had a cheese/bread/honey type item (very tasty) and my younger cousin had a chocolate yogurt, which she adored and then craved for the rest of the trip! We recommend a stop here if you are staying in Plaka!",April 2019,Kosmikon Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1657247-Reviews-Kosmikon_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Not called Sugar Mama's anymore....,"After having dinner at The Secret Garden (which was wonderful), my daughter asked if we could get some ice cream. I quickly hopped on the Trip Advisor app and this was the second ranked ice cream place within the greater Woodbridge area, so down the street we walked. First, the place is no longer called Sugar Mama's (it's called Pretentious something?), second, the ice cream was pretty bad. I sampled multiple flavors and both the flavor and the texture of all of them were not good. Yikes. I feel badly because this must be a new owner/establishment and they're not off to a good start. The girl working behind the counter was kind though, so that's a plus for them.",March 2019,Sugar Mama's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58041-d10583059-Reviews-Sugar_Mama_s-Occoquan_Prince_William_County_Virginia.html,"Occoquan, Virginia",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Holy cannoli! Yum,"This was a last minute stop on the way home from an evening in Occoquan - and what a good decision!! When you walk in, it is definitely overwhelming because there are SO many delicious items the await you. Every direction you turn there's a table or a refrigerator or a case just entirely covered with baked goodies. I chose a cannoli, a slice of lemon meringue pie for my hubby and my daughter opted for the frosted sugar cookie in the shape of a butterfly. The cannoli was scrumptious, my daughter enjoyed the cookie and the lemon pie (I managed to sneak a taste!) was perfectly tart with a sky-high meringue. We will certainly return!!!",March 2019,Mom's Apple Pie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58041-d4155226-Reviews-Mom_s_Apple_Pie-Occoquan_Prince_William_County_Virginia.html,"Occoquan, Virginia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Quaint, refreshing and delicious!!","This place won't be a secret much longer with all of these amazing reviews! Ha! Truly, this place is a gem. The outdoor seating is so perfect and all of the food is very good. They are amazing with child diners too! The attentiveness of the staff and the quality of the food is unbeatable. They have a great menu with a lot of choices (even a gluten free menu!).

"Light, fluffy and flavorful","My daughter and I actually discovered the newest location (down on the National Harbor waterfront) by accident when we were wandering around last weekend, so when my husband arrived home from his business trip we knew we had to take him. Since we were already going to be in Georgetown, we decided to come to the Cadys Alley location. The doughnuts were just as delicious as before. We highly recommend these for any doughnut lover!",April 2019,District Doughnut,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d13984342-Reviews-District_Doughnut-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Disappointed; reviews are deceptive,"We picked this restaurant based on the reviews and were excited to try the food. Initially it seemed like it would be a smooth experience; it was 11:30am on a Tuesday and we were seated without a wait. The hostess said ""there's no wait for a table, but we do need it freed up by 12:30 for another party,"" um, ok, weird/rude thing to say to a new guest? I didn't really care because we had planned on being in and out within an hour anyway. We wanted to go walk and show our daughter the monuments. So, we sat, waited about 5 minutes and our server came to the table to introduce herself and was very sweet. At that point we had had plenty of time with their (overpriced) menu, so we were ready to order (husband and myself ordered a burger; daughter a hot dog). We waited literally 32 minutes before asking where the food was.... that is insane for a hamburger on a Tuesday before the business rush. Our server went to look for our food and came back with it (she said she ran into the person who was going to bring it to our table and insisted on bringing it herself). We weren't wowed by the food. It was just average. We ate, paid and left. We probably won't be back.",April 2019,Founding Farmers DC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d1167468-Reviews-Founding_Farmers_DC-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
OK Cupcakes; Customer service was lovely.,"I truly wanted this to be a Wow! experience, but it wasn't. I purchased 4 cupcakes of different varieties so I could make a sound judgement. Overall, actual cake had little to no flavor and was somewhat dry/too light to hold up to the type of icing. The icing on the spring/Easter cupcake was pure sugar - way too sweet. The salted caramel icing was a great consistency and had great flavor, but the cake was terrible. The marshmallow cupcake had a good tasting filling, but there was not enough of it; the actual cake was not good, and the dark chocolate coating was too bitter. Lastly, the peanut butter cupcake did actually have ok flavor in the cake itself, and the frosting was again a good consistency but just mediocre flavor (a milk chocolate). Perhaps I will give this location another try with a different flavor.",April 2019,Sprinkles Georgetown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d3249237-Reviews-Sprinkles_Georgetown-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Perfectly French,"My daughter and I are macaron fanatics and when we walked past this darling French pastry boutique we couldn't help but go inside. The macarons were both unique and delicious. We loved that they had staple flavors like vanilla and pistachio, but also adventurous ones such as strawberry candy marshmallow, orange blossom and black currant violet. This is definitely a must-go!!",April 2019,Ladurée Georgetown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d12499855-Reviews-Laduree_Georgetown-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
