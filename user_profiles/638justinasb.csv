One time thing to see,"Athens not my preferred place, but if you arround, you must visit Akropolis. Althoughits a bit expensive (20 eur) for such experience.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Just average,"The place could be rated just as average, 6 out of 10. If you know how seafood should taste like, this is not the best experience (also not the worst in my life). We had grilled and fried calamari and grilled octopus. Having current experience I would go back to this place.",October 2019,Stoa Allios,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7134770-Reviews-Stoa_Allios-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Extremely nice hotel,"The hotel is extremely nice. The location was perfect for me. Breakfast looked a bit expensive, but it was really good. Next time I'm in Luxembourg I will consider staying at this hotel as well. Good luck.",December 2016,Meli√° Luxembourg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190356-d1382442-Reviews-Melia_Luxembourg-Luxembourg_City.html,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",hotels,5.0,4.5
