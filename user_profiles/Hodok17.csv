Inconsistent customer service,"I am giving the 3 stars review because while flight itself was short and unremarkable, but the customer service surrounding was not good. First, make sure you read a small print of your tickets. They charge extra fee, if you do not come with the downloaded online check-in. We were having trouble getting check in online, so the customer service gave us a break. However, here where inconsistency were: on the flight Athens-Santorini we got free baggage check in. On the flight back (with the same bags) we were told that we had to pay for the checked in baggage and could not take them with us. While we were standing on the security line (which was very chaotic) I noticed people with bags, which were the same size as ours and even bigger and heavier. They all got in and got they bags taken for check in for free while we boarding. It gave me impression that check in might be a subject to the agent's mood (the guy who was doing our check in on the Santorini-Athens flight was unpleasant to everyone in that line).",September 2019,Volotea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d10533097-Reviews-Volotea,World,flights,3.0,3.0

Great way to spend a day,"This tour honestly exceeded expectations. All of us on our small group shared that notion (the group was only 6 people). You can check the stops on the tour description they give on this website. Unlike other tours I've been to, this one was quite well paced and relaxing. We met our guide Nicholas at the Thira bus station, he already had a sign with our names on it. He was most gracious host and created fun atmosphere. He seemed as a person who is genially proud of this place and strove to share it with us. He also was super helpful picking angles for photos and offered to take pictures. The only thing I wished for is that he had a microphone, because with roads being quite rocky, sometimes there are a lot of rattle and it is hard to hear what guide was saying. Regardless, it was great time. Highly recommend.

"Adorable, comfortable and affordable","We stayed there for only three nights and I wish it was more. Location is super convenient: in a two min walk from the beach and restaurants and shops; a bus to the Thira is across the street. The hotel also has a pool and bar, where you can get drinks and food. I had breakfast there: Greek yogurt with fruits and it was very good. They provide free towels for the beach too. The building itself is super cute. Rooms
were clean and comfy. I think all of them have balconies. Things I was not prepared for were: roosters early in morning and local dogs, who made quite a noise as well. So, if you are a light sleeper, get yourself ear plugs. The airport is close enough too and sometimes you can hear them pass by, but this is true for the entire village of Kamari. Staff at the hotel is beyond friendly and helpful.

Never cease to amaze,"This was my time here and I could not wait to get there. It is a magnificent creation that withstood thousands of years. If you are traveling at the end of the tourist season, you do not need to worry about major crowds (they still be there, but not as much). If you are traveling during hot time of the year, then get there earlier. We got a guide who was soliciting clients at the gate and paid 30 euros for entry and tour (entry itself is 20 euro). The tour was uneven in a quality: the guide was not taking us up to the temple itself, but she talked about history of Athens and building of the temple. However, in my opinion it went on too long.

If you are not interested in the exhibit dedicated to the nature, you can buy a ticket to Planetarium only. They show two short films about auroras. It worth the time and money. Afterwards, make your way to the observation deck (you will see entire city) and top it off with the visit to the rotating restaurant on the top.

The large yard of the shrine is full of cherry trees, which created added an extra beauty factor to the shrine. The complex is located in a middle of a bustling neighborhood, so you will hit a few marks that day just by visiting this shrine. There were also different activities going on in the yard. I am not sure if it was because of the Golden week or it is a normal occurrence for the temple, but it worth checking out. I saw a tea ceremony performed for the viewers in the yard. You will need to pay money to sit close, but I saw it just by standing nearby. The entry is free. But there are a couple attractions you will have to pay money to enter.

a decent way to spend a day,"Booked a tour via this website. The reviews seemed to be good and overall tour met the expectations. It started a bit chaotic. First, my confirmation email said that pick up was BY the hotel. It did not mention that you actually have to go INTO hotel, find their counter and register. They put workers in the main area of the hotel lobby to direct travelers to the counter. The scene was chaotic, people were confused on what to do, and workers were running around trying to direct everyone to the correct place and rushing those whose tours were about to leave through the registration counters. It takes some time to get to the second pick up point, so I would recommend to stock up on snacks and water (they allow that on the bus). Our guide was super nice and attentive, but suffered the affliction of many tour guides: talking a lot about where Tokyoties shop, go to restaurants, etc. and not presenting enough history. She gave us some details about each of our stops, but I wish tour would include more in depth narration about history, significance and tradition represented in each place. Macha tea prep ceremony and temples were great and lunch that they provided was very tasty. I thought that the last stop at Enoshima was kind of unnecessary: we were there during the later part of the day, and since it was March, it was really cold on the seaside. Moreover, this place would require at least 2-2.5 hours to explore re and we only had an hour. So, this stop would make more sense during warmer time of the year. I'd rather we spent more time on the previous stops or someplace else than on Enoshima. We also end up sitting in traffic and got back about 1.5 hour later. Overall, I thought it was worth the money I spent, because they took me to places I would not go by myself.",March 2019,Kamakura Walking Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g1066457-d11446626-Kamakura_Walking_Tour-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Shinjuku, Japan",activities,3.0,4.5
"Interesting, but something is missing","As a museum fanatic I make a point of visiting at least one museum in every city I go. Edo-Tokyo museum presents history of the city in a logical historical progression. It has all the trimmings of the museum dedicated to any city: models of palaces, recreated city dwellings, etc. The sequence goes down the history and covers daily life, arts, science, politics and religion. Nonetheless, it feels some something is constantly missing. Major plus it is pretty kid friendly, there are things for kids to do and touch. It is a good place to spend time on a bad weather day.

A great option for a budget traveler,"I booked this hotel on a recommendation from someone and I would like to pass it on further. It is a chain hotel and is great for a budget conscious traveler. My single room was tiny, but squeaky clean and comfortable. I loved the fact that I could operate the entire room from my bed (all the light switches are on the headboard, plus usb port, two wall jacks and environment control). Room also had a fridge and tea pot. Amenities included trouser press on the floor, microwave and vending machine (I did not use them though). Hotel does not have a restaurant, but it is located on the street full of restaurants and diners, as well as multiple markets (Lawson, 7-eleven and Family Mart), which work 24 hours and are great places to purchase drinks, snacks and some food items. Also, there is take out place by the entrance to the hotel. Hotel is conveniently located within 5-7 min walk from a subway station, which include several lines, making it easy to get to other parts of the city. There are two more APA hotels located in the vicinity: Iidabashi Ekimae (across from one of subway entrances) and Tokyo-Kudanshita (further away from the subway).

Restaurant shares a tight space with the Afternoon tea company shop, so you can totally shop while you wait. The staff was extremely pleasant, they made sure I got to the cash register faster because it was my time to be seated.

People were picnicking under the cherry trees and atmosphere was festive. However, without cherry blossoms, park is quite average.

Hits all the checks,"This hotel gives everything one needs when traveling to Venice on a vacation. A spectacular building with great view -check; nice, clean rooms with interesting views-check; a pleasant staff-check; a good location (close to S. Marco and other landmarks) -check.

If your booking does not include breakfast it is 8 euros per person and you get more for your money than in some other places in Venice. For example, we had a brioche and coffee breakfast for 5 euros elsewhere. One major con: it is 4 large flights of stairs to go to the reception and rooms. So, it might be difficult for people with mobility and or heart issues or little kids. A couple of helpful hint: when looking for hotel ask for Campo S. Maria Formosa. It is easier to locate on the map than the street Ruga Giuffa (hotel address), the entrance is on the side. If you take a water ferry from an airport get off F. te. Nove A.

My friends drank fresh orange juice and a rainbow drink (several juices mixed to look like a rainbow) and were pretty satisfied. The rainbow drink got high praise. I had a mojito (really good). For dessert we had coffees and teas. Although, if you are used for a fast service you might find service in this place a bit slow, the food is worth waiting, The restaurant atmosphere is relaxing, so you can sip your drink while waiting for food. My only problem (as always with many restaurants in Europe) is that people who smoke could be next to you. Also, the restaurant offers hookah. It has outdoor sitting though, which would allow for a fresh air and people watching while you eat.",June 2018,Kebab House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298484-d3759864-Reviews-Kebab_House-Moscow_Central_Russia.html,"Moscow, Russia",restaurants,4.0,3.5

Really good service,"It was my first time flying JAL. I heard good things about JAL and was expecting the high quality service. My expectations were met: the crew and staff were very courteous and helpful. I had to transfer in Tokyo and I mentioned that to a staff at the counter in NYC. When I landed in Tokyo, an airport staff was waiting for me to help me with the transfer (I had to go through customs, get my luggage and then re-register for a domestic flight-all within 1 hour). The food was nice and seats comfortable. I saw the crew leaving notes for passengers, who were sleeping during the food service, in case they want to eat later. A practice apparently common for JAL and ANA, but something I've never seen on any other airlines (in US, Britain, Spain, France). Considering that flight from NY is 14 hours the comfort of seats and service were very important.

The seats have some extra space, we've had entertainment (live TV included), snacks were ok. On some flights they sell food, which is not bad deal, in comparison to what is being sold at the airport. However, on a shorter flights they only have snacks. Complimentary beverages were provided. Crew were nice and courteous.

Start your day in the Old City here,"A lovely little place within the walls of the Icheri Sheher (Old City) will provide you with the nice dining experience. I came here with my friends for a breakfast. We had different omelettes (plain and with cheese), blini with meat and cheese, and tea (of course). If you are accustomed to large portions, then order more. Blini can be ordered by a count. Even though for many foreign travelers even familiar food items might look different, it tastes great. Prices are quite reasonable and staff is very friendly and polite. You have an option of sitting on a small terrace outside or go inside, which is filled with items from a bygone era (cute photo ops). Prices are reasonable and within the city average.

Where the old meets new,"Since I grew up in this city, coming to the boulevard always brings childhood memories. It has changed though. There is an old part, that runs in two levels along side the most of the older (and central) part of the city. This part provides you with many photo ops, opportunity to walk by the sea, people watching, and tons of small cafes, that offer a variety of snacks, drinks, ice cream and food. There is a shade from old trees, that shelters you from the sun and a sea breeze, which brings a relief on a hot day. There are also carousels for kids. You can also visit a large Ferris wheel in the newer part of the boulevard in order to get a panoramic view of the city. There is also a ""Little Venice"", which is a small ride in artificial canals.

A garden that lived through times,"For many locals and those who are returning to their birth city, this place is known as a Governor's garden (the original name, that was given to this place during the times, when Azerbaijan was part of Russian Empire). For more than a century, this place provided locals with a shade and heat relief during hot summer days and opportunities to socialize.

He got information about Hitler's plan of attack on the Soviet Union, but was not believed. He also provided a vital intelligence on Japan's military plans in 1941.

Through years and into the future,"Those who remember old times, call it ""Parapet"" because a garden, that was in this location, had walls with extension.

Eat and eat more,"This place represents a category of restaurants that seemed to be growing fast outside the confines of the busy city. Getting there requires a car, although a ride is about 20 minutes from the city center. Decor is a bit kitschy, but not overwhelming. There are different sitting options: from tables in the middle of the pool (elevated platforms that are surrounded by water and small fountains) to the open second floor gallery to a large room inside. The food and service were excellent. Prices are on a high average side. Beware, that if you sit outside during summer months, you might end up a pray to mosquitoes. Also, sitting outside, makes conversation difficult because of a very loud music. Music is mostly live and musicians will provide you with a healthy mix of national and more western style tunes.

Average,"I visited this place with a bunch of local friends for a sushi deal. According to my local friends, every Tuesday and Sunday, restaurant has deals, that allow visitors to order sets of 16 pieces for 17 az. manat or get unlimited sets for a slightly higher price. We walked in, and despite only two occupied tables, were were told that there were no space for us. After we left, a friend made a phone call and made a reservation, which allowed us to have a dinner there. It seems that restaurant management was holding spaces for reservations, although there is no indication that this restaurant is by the reservation only. The sushi were ok, but nothing special. To my taste, they were too big and had too much cream cheese in them. The server was super nice though. This place is quiet, but since it is small, the group of 6 had to squeeze in the one table.

A very Brooklyn ( or NY) experience,"Park at Coney Island has been a staple in New York life for over 100 years. It still is. It is as entertaining as it is tacky, as local as it is touristy. It might be not on the top of your list if this is your first trip to NYC, but it is worth considering, especially during summer. Here is what you get at Coney Island: in addition to Luna Park with different rides for all ages, old-fashion side show, frequent street performers, original Nathan's hot dog place, tons of food stands and open area dining on the boardwalk, and the beach. By the way, with amount of small shops around, you can easily satisfy all your beach needs from the swim suits and towels to sunscreen and sand toys and Aquarium next door. Luna Park sells passes for the avid riders. The original Cyclone (Ferris wheel) is still operational. Coney Island is easily accessible via several train lines from Manhattan and Queens (although ride might be around 50 min to 1 hour). Boardwalk is busy with a mixed crowd of locals and tourists alike. On Fridays, they have fireworks in the evening.

A fair experience,"I gave the hotel 4 stars because there were several things that I liked and a couple that I didn't. First, the room was a part of the deal with Jetblue and the room that we got, was not exactly what I expected, since in the booking it looked as there were options, when it fact there were not. I am not sure whose fault it was; hotel's or the Jetblue's. If your room on the city side and you are not used to the lights, you might feel uncomfortable. Anything that happens on the street, you will hear. The room was too small for 2 people who are not a couple. We were given a roll away bed, that barely fit in. Room was clean though. Second, the hotel (as all Hiltons) has event spaces, in 3 days we witnessed proms, conference, and a wedding. We did not hear any noise, but some people apparently did. Third, the hotel premises are small, but nice: area to sit outside a bar, hammocks under the trees, small pool and a private beach. I was told that hotel was fully booked and was worried that there would be no space in the outside areas. We waited till 4 or 5 pm to go there and spent earlier part of the day away from the hotel. There are Starbucks, bar that serves food (pretty good) and restaurant ""Aqua"" that is not immediately visible from the lobby. The check-in staff forgot to mention it to us. However, we ate breakfast there before our departure and it was quite good. They have hot station, selection of breads, fruits, juices, cereals, pancakes, etc. The prices at the bar and restaurant are kind of high ($14 for a mojito).There is a small shop on the hotel premises, that is opened late. It sells snacks, water, etc. Room service is served till late night (we did not use it). For cheaper breakfast options: Dunkin Donuts, McDonald's and a local restaurant across the street. The location of the hotel is quite convenient: all Nassau attractions are in a walking distance (shopping, museums, port, etc.). Jankanoo beach is in a walking distance too and fish fry restaurants are about 15 min away. It is a historic hotel, so it's location might be too tight with the city life of Nassau for some and a bit outdated in decor for others. However, overall, I must say the stay was pleasant.

"Spring breakers beach, according to locals","It is a narrow strip of sand between next to a busy road with a lot of construction on the other side of the street (hotels). I saw bunch of local small grill places on the beach, that also seemed to be selling drinks. At the end of that beach is a row of local Fish Fry restaurants. Since it is public beach, I saw people off the cruise ships and other places heading there. I don't know if it is crowded during the day, but by 5 pm it was pretty empty, with some locals hanging out on the beach and in the parked cars nearby. According to the locals, this is spring breakers beach, so I guess if you are heading to Bahamas, please check the college break schedule.",June 2017,Junkanoo Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147416-d2477014-Reviews-Junkanoo_Beach-Nassau_New_Providence_Island_Bahamas.html,New Providence Island,attractions,3.0,3.5

It was fun walking in the evening with a drink in the hand, but the information is not that plentiful, I was kind of hoping for more.
