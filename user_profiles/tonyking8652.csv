Simple fare on a terrace with a view!,"A good food tip for Marrakech; avoid the scruffy, overpriced food on the El - fnaa square and inside the Medina and come out here and eat something that doesn't look like a dubious dog's-dinner and in a clean and pleasant environment!
A couple of cooling drinks, hot and delicious skewers with chips and a really nice Seafood Pastilla overlooking The iconic minaret of Koutoubia.

Beautiful location: cuisine Disappointing,"We had Just 3 nights in Fès. First night at El Mokri Palace it was late so we ate in and had beautifully cooked local dishes, but second evening decided to eat nearby at Fès Cafe.
The location in a tranquil garden is alluring! The restaurant looks cosy and welcoming and the menu board seems attractive!
Regrettably the food was at best dreary and not appetising and service a bit longwinded : staff rather detached! Overall, not a good choice and very expensive for what it was!
On our final full day in Fès, we revisited for a quick afternoon drink in the garden: very pleasant , cool and shady and one doesn't hurry, does one? No, but it's neither pleasant nor courteous for the barman to interrupt your tranquility at 3.45 pm to ask you to pay up because the ""afternoon shift"" is going off duty!

Fascinating but beware!,"The souks and marketplaces of Morocco are one of the main reasons for our visits , but here in Marrakech it is really a mixed pleasure!

Today most canny tourists carry around.Mobile phones installed with Google maps and know EXACTLY where they are going. This, is not to the liking of the many, apparently jobless young men, who aggressively repeatedly try to mislead tourists and get very aggressive if you don’t hand over money for their “misinformation” !

As main course I decided to try the robata of sea bream , a special form of charcoal grilling - a perfect piece of crispy skinned fish on a small bed of equally delicious fresh grilled vegetables!
My partner took the octopus dish, a seafood not really to my taste , and declared it to be "" Everything octopus should be"" - I'm sure it was!

A hotel? Or a private museum?,"That's the question I have to ask after a night's stay at 5 Heeren, because the two functions do not necessarily fit together very well!

As a museum , the ""public areas "" work well, but as free access and comfort for hotel guests , paying a premium price they do not work so well! The assertion that visiting guests should ""feel at home"" here is not really valid, because antique or no, the ground floor is too cluttered and ""museumy"" to be anything but awkwardly uncomfortable!
It's nice to stay in a hotel that is ""apart"" from the normal, but there are times ,as here, where sparing use is better than ""overkill""!
Turning to the rooms ( which in spite of an overall museum ambience) must perform the hotel function of rest, relaxation and a good night's sleep) the opposite to the public spaces seems to apply. Regular rooms are nicely themed, also with their selection of antiques BUT are generally small, and lacking in ""comfort"" - no soft chairs, no nice bath to relax in, and a pretty basic ( not luxury) set of toiletries and no feel of freshly laundered ""fluffy towels"".

The fish was diminutive and dry, the supposedly spicy devilled chicken was dry and tasteless , the Otak-Otake was rubbery ( more like Spam) and the only slightly tasty item was the brinjal . but the grey sauce looked very unappetising!

The exhibition itself seems quite well arranged and the Rubens paintings are hung in a very beautiful setting, and other rooms with paintings ,engravings, furnishings and musical instruments are worth seeing , but why is EVERYTHING labelled only in German?

First, the place is incredibly scruffy! No, I don’t think the place is dirty; just totally lacking the TLC that that can make a restaurant a memorable and satisfying experience. It being a very warm evening our reserved table was outside on the terrace: a reasonable decision!

In my opinion, the menu selection in some ways mirrors the locale itself, bland and unimaginative, but certainly not at the lower end of the price range. Two of us ordered the veal cordon blue and the other the Senfrostbraten. My Veal Cordon Bleu was diminutive ,
cut in two pieces, sitting on a VERY salty but characterless orange coloured sauce, and with some obviously old and very tough green asparagus and some blond potato croquettes taken straight from a freezer pack!

Mixed Feelings!,"It's probably the ""world's most beautiful coal mine"" and if you take a tour, for those with a specific interest in Industrial archeology, it is probably a fascinating experience. However , as a site of ""general"" tourist interest it has some shortcomings. The site is very large and seems to lack many ""user friendly"" essentials.
1) signposting around the perimeter is not very clear for arriving motorists, and within the site does not seem to give walking distances!
2) although much of the site is broadly speaking "" open access"" much of it is of no great interest, taken over by independent operators and it is easy to waste time on fruitless wandering with no signposts,
3) The initial impression of the reception area in the washing plant is good, the long escalator, with good views going upward. and the A/C interior, but once inside it all seems very sterile!

Broadly speaking DimSum Bistro in Bilk came out pretty well. The little restaurant is light and airy and very clean and the service is courteous and all 7 items came in manageable relays, and were hot and freshly prepared.Most were excellent but a couple missed the mark for us, the Black bean pork ribs were tasty but undercooked and very difficult to get the meat off the bones! The beef balls with lemon grass and spinach were too big as dim sum and too dense and chewy! We were a little disappointed with the two types of Chee Cheong Fun which were not those light slippery rice noodles but more like rice paper - however the taste was good.

Having said that, we were not really over-impressed! Firstly, it's not a cheap option! The venue is quite spartan, and honestly, the burgers are nothing special! For my taste the burger itself seemed a bit dry and insipid and the bun nondescript!

At a time when we are all exhorted to be environmentally aware there seemed to be an awful lot of packaging including plastic and foil!
If ( as often in Asia) I get a burger from an auto machine I expect it to be foil packed, but from a specialist over the counter outlet it's not very elegant! Rather liked the spicy fries but much too SALTY.
