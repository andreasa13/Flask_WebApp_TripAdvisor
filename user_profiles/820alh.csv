Excellent Choice For People Going To The Capitol,"If you are going to a show at the Capitol Theater in Clearwater this is a great place to have a pre-show meal. The food was excellent. We sat right opposite the food pick up station and watched the action and it was unbelievably efficient. The Duck Fat Fries were to die for and the Grouper Tacos we great, Two in our party had the surf and turf and loved it and one had the Thai Salad with Salmon and, again loved it. Our waiter was attentive and when we told him we had to be out in an hour for the show, he said: ""say no more"" and we were out the door an hour after we entered.

It doesn't qualify as a place for a romantic quiet evening because the place is really buzzy and the action is fast but considering what it is it deserves 5 stars",March 2020,Clear Sky on Cleveland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34141-d12513945-Reviews-Clear_Sky_on_Cleveland-Clearwater_Florida.html,"Clearwater, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice Venue Average Food,"We stopped for lunch having read the reviews on Trip Advisor. It was a very nice venue and the food was ok but just. Our server was very nice and attentive. The food came out quickly which might have been our first clue it would be just average. You can't cook fish, or burgers or chicken in 3 minutes. It was likely pre-cooked and sitting under heat lamps.",February 2020,Circles Waterfront,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29170-d839165-Reviews-Circles_Waterfront-Apollo_Beach_Florida.html,"Apollo Beach, Florida",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Great If There Are Some Manatees,"Today we drove up to see the manatees with family visiting from the UK. One member of the family was so excited and looking forward to seeing them.

When we arrived we were forced to park in the overflow parking a pretty good hike from the manatees. As we walked to the site, we passed a steady stream of people, at least a hundred, walking back on the gravel path. When we got there there were plenty of spaces in the main parking lot. The only things there were none of were manatees and no shuttles between the lots! There were lots of old people with canes forced to walk the long-distance from and back to the overflow lot. Oh! the other thing that wasn't there was someone with the brains to tell people in the remote overflow lot that there were no manatees today. I spoke with two staff members one I was told was the manager. When I asked why the staff at the remote lot didn't either tell people or write on the whiteboard that there were no manatees today? She said ""that's a good idea, we didn't think of that."" Duh! As Bill Engvall would say ""LADY, HERE'S YOUR SIGN!""",February 2020,Tampa Electric's Manatee Viewing Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29170-d267429-Reviews-Tampa_Electric_s_Manatee_Viewing_Center-Apollo_Beach_Florida.html,"Apollo Beach, Florida",attractions,1.0,4.5

Very Good,The restaurant is everyone thought the place had very nice with very good food. I had the lobster roll and I have had better. It’s ok but I’d have something else next time.,July 2019,Salty's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154976-d708674-Reviews-Salty_s-Halifax_Halifax_Regional_Municipality_Nova_Scotia.html,"Halifax, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.0
A Great Experience,"We a restaurant cares enough to serve great bread the food will also be great. As a San Franciscan for 15 years I have eaten my share of sour dough but none better than at Messin. I could have had nothing else and left happy but I didn’t. I had the lobster bisque, lobster salad and the apple crumble and they were all to die for!!!",September 2019,Messinn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d10094640-Reviews-Messinn-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great Food, lovely Setting","The Blind Mule has some of the best food we’ve had in North Carolina. My wife’s beef tip appetizer was fabulous and she really enjoyed her branzini. My filet was so tender and flavorful I can’t remember a better one and my beet salad appetizer was delicious. The service was very good and the owner/chefs wife made us feel very welcome.

The only two things that kept me from rating it 5-star. The bread was dry when we were finished with our appetizers we were asked to keep our dirty knives. A five star restaurant doesn’t worry about washing a couple of extra knives. That said we would return in a heartbeat!",September 2019,The Blind Mule at Toxaway Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49269-d10377969-Reviews-The_Blind_Mule_at_Toxaway_Station-Lake_Toxaway_North_Carolina.html,"Lake Toxaway, North Carolina",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Fun Experience,"Today my wife and I joined her brother and his wife for a really fun experience. The river was very low so our 9 mile trip had to be shortened which was initially disappointing. We’ve gone with the company on two prior occasions always doing the 9 mile trip. However, our guide Jim Hampton was a real pro who determined to make it a fun day and he far surpassed our expectations in every way. We had a ball and can recommend Jim and French Broad Adventures if you want to have a fun day rafting on the French Broad River in Western North Carolina.",September 2019,French Broad Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g49326-d562281-Reviews-French_Broad_Adventures-Marshall_North_Carolina.html,"Marshall, North Carolina",attractions,5.0,5.0
Where The Locals Meet To Eat,"As we stepped off the cruise ship tender we asked a local dock worker where the best fish and chip were. He told us a couple of places but added that he at at the Fort Cafe so off we went in search of Fish and Chips and some mushy peas. When we got there it was packed and the wait was and hour. We shopped and went back and were told the wait was down to a 45 min by the waitress.Initially I thought she was a bit gruff and we debated waiting but she came back a few min later and told me she could get us a table, if we would wait for her to clean it so we did. Very glad we did. Not only did the waitress warm up to us she guided us on our order and bottom-line the fish and chips were fantastic as were the mushy peas. Worth the wait!",July 2019,Fort Cafe & Take Away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190781-d2324917-Reviews-Fort_Cafe_Take_Away-Lerwick_Mainland_Shetland_Islands_Scotland.html,"Mainland, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
If You love Fish This Is A Must,"Another great find on Trip Advisor. Great seafood and the bread is the best sourdough I ever tasted and having lived in the San Francisco area for over 20 years it says it all.

I had the salad entree with lobster and it was delicious The lobster soup was also to die for my companions had fish and they also said it was great.",July 2019,Messinn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d10094640-Reviews-Messinn-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
