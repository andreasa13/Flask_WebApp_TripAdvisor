Still Serving Great Value in Homewood,"We are locals and have dined here many times, but not recently. We were glad to see the ambiance, menu and service were essentially unchanged. The menu is classic Italian, with many options. The wine list is short, but of extremely high quality (try the Amarone, it's amazing!). Our server was willing to make a number of changes and substitutions to our orders. Don't let the adjacent construction activity deter you. This little, unassuming restaurant is a true treasure in downtown Homewood.

"A Birmingham ""Hidden Gem""","Seasons 52 is located in the Summit shopping center, a HUGE shopping center located just south of Birmingham off of busy US HWY 280. Birmingham has several iconic fine dining restaurants, and Seasons 52 is on par with those fine establishments. The service is impeccable. The wait staff is knowledgable and professional. Their wine, beer and cocktail list is extensive, diverse, and of high quality. The menu features mostly ""seasonal"" items, as the name implies. Our party enjoyed sea scallops, sea bass, and filet mignon. All were perfectly prepared and paired with fine wines from the extensive ""by the glass"" list. They offer their deserts in small, ""shot glass"" sizes, which is really great after enjoying a large, tasty meal. These folks know what they are doing.

Excellent Lunch Menu!,"We dined here for lunch recently and I was quite impressed. Ferus features dining alongside their beautiful micro-brewery. The space is very open and inviting and the lunch menu is short, but of high quality. Our party of 4 sampled the arugula salad with grilled salmon, fried chicken tenders, grilled cheese sandwich with fries, and the wedge salad. All were outstanding! I highly recommend this new area in Trussville. There are other eateries close by and at times they feature sports on the massive outdoor screen.

"An Irish ""Cheers"", with Good Food","This cool little bar and grill is located in one of the oldest neighborhoods in downtown/""old"" Mobile. The location is literally in a small, but nice, neighborhood, but parking is not an issue. There is a free public parking area located diagonally from the restaurant. This is a bar, ok? Not much of a wine list or food menu, but what they do offer is of high quality at great prices. I had the specialty burger of the day, the ""LA Burger"", with potato salad and it was awesome!

Great Seafood and Convenient Location,"Over the years, we have dined here many times and have never been disappointed. Note that they are located in the heart of a popular vacation spot on Perdido Key, Florida, so the prices are a bit high, especially for dinner. I suggest trying them for lunch with better value and come back for dinner if you are pleased. They offer a diverse, seafood-heavy menu, plus decent wines and craft beers and a full bar. Service is consistently good and they offer indoor and outdoor seating all year long. Also be aware parking can be really challenging, especially during peak season around dinnertime. There are very few ""high end"" restaurants on Perdido Key, so give them a try!",November 2020,Crab Trap Perdido Key,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1435792-d538971-Reviews-Crab_Trap_Perdido_Key-Pensacola_Beach_Florida.html,"Pensacola Beach, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Great Family-Owned Restaurant,"Shiki, located in the Hallman Hill condominium building on 19th Street in the SoHo area of Homewood, is simply one of my favorite restaurants in all of Homewood. This small, unassuming place offers consistently great and affordable sushi and Thai food, prepared with the care you would expect from a family run business. We have dined here many times both in the restaurant and via takeout. The service and attention to detail is impeccable. Some of our menu favorites include Spring Rolls, Crab Angels, Seafood Baked Avocado, Squid Salad, and just about all sushi options.

The really good news is that the food, which was great at the old location, is actually even better. The upgraded menu has many diverse options and several unique Locals creations.

Easy Hike To The Falls,"This free public attraction offers several great hiking options. The easiest is a short (less than one mile) and fairly flat hike through the beautiful mountain woods to the Linville Falls viewing area. It's well worth the walk, but do be sure and wear comfortable, hard soled shoes. After a rain, there will be a few muddy spots and the rocks at the falls can be a bit slippery. There are two other trails for the more adventurous and aggressive hikers. NOTE: If you enjoy a more quiet experience, go very early. This is a popular attraction and gets crowded and noisy on weekends and during the summer vacation period. Parking can also be a real pain when crowded.",July 2020,Linville Gorge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g49295-d561352-Reviews-Linville_Gorge-Linville_Falls_North_Carolina.html,"Linville Falls, North Carolina",attractions,5.0,4.5

They also have other dishes besides trout which are great as well. Their wine list is full of high quality yet inexpensive options. Our servers were simply outstanding.

GREAT New Fairhope Addition!,"In a town of numerous great restaurants, Hope Farm is going to give all of them a run for their money for top restaurant in the area. They do ""farm to table"" cuisine, focusing on local ingredients, and they do it quite well. Our meal of grilled whole snapper, warm mushroom salad (best salad ever!), and local vegetables was outstanding. That said, many restaurants are using that theme these days. There are a number of things that make Hope Farm unique for Fairhope. The space is huge, with indoor and outdoor seating. I assume they will offer to hold large events there as the space can accommodate large parties. The ambiance is ""clean, modern, laid back rustic"", unlike anything else around. The cocktail and wine list is the best I've seen in the area. The Man o' War cocktail was amazing. Their wines are quite diverse and of great quality, and you can still find great ones by the glass in the $12-15 range. As a local, it is exciting to see a new star come to our local dining scene.

Several great ACBT sites are in the Orange Beach/Gulf Shores/Gulf State Park areas. I have birded them all and have found it to be some of the best, most diverse birding anywhere in the world.

The Jeff Friend Trail is the shorter trail and runs partially along Little Lagoon and also features a kayak/canoe launch. The Pine Beach Trail is the longer trail and is very diverse including deep woods, Little Lagoon and even the Gulf beach area.

There are a few picnic tables and a really nice raised boardwalk over the marshy area where you can see alligators, turtles, birds and other wildlife. My only reason for the 4 star rating versus 5 is the challenging parking. Your best bet is to either park at a nearby restaurant (several are within easy walking distance of Wade Ward) and visit after your meal, or park at the spaces far behind the Pizza Hut right next door.

We dined here for dinner with some friends and enjoyed our evening immensely. Our party of 6 sampled various specialty cocktails, fine wines, sushi, salads, fresh fish and shellfish, followed by scrumptious deserts. Everything was incredibly well presented, fresh and tasty.

Where Locals Go,"We stumbled onto this great little restaurant while walking around Naples. We noticed right away that most of the patrons were locals, known by name and food preference by the wait staff, a VERY good sign. The place is small and seating is quite condensed, so you will not find a lot of ""free space"" here, but you will experience great food and service in an authentic Neapolitan setting. They are located near the Piazza Bellini, named for the famous opera composer. We chose pizza and their house wines and were not disappointed.

(3) The footing, especially near the Parthenon, can be quite uneven and hard to walk upon. (4) It can get quite windy up there, so bring a jacket even on a warm day.

Walk Where Paul Walked,"The Apostle Paul and this ancient city are mentioned often in the Bible. His letter to the Ephesian church is one of the most quoted books in the New Testament. Also, the ancient Ephesus church is one of the seven churches addressed in the New Testament book of Revelation. We were so amazed at the quality of the restoration of this ancient city. It is truly a realistic glimpse into the ancient past. I would recommend a guided tour because there is SO MUCH detail that can be missed without a professional to point things out for you. This was one of the most enjoyable attractions of our entire Holy Land cruise.

Pretty Amazing for non-Catholics Too,"As some have said, this holy place where Mary the mother of Jesus Christ lived and died is a ""must see"" for those of the Catholic faith. I must say as a non-Catholic (Protestant) Christian, I was very moved by this visit for several reasons. First, the house is very small and simple, which one would expect from what we know of Mary. Second, the holy water springs and prayer notes wall add another simple, yet strong tone of validity and holiness to the place. And finally, we were treated to a brief Catholic mass in the small chapel at the rear of the property. It was amazing! The priest gave a wonderful, hard hitting sermon though it was only a few minutes long. For ALL believers in the Son of God, I highly recommend a visit. NOTE: The crowds can be overwhelming so be prepared to queue and wait for a bit to enter the house. NOTE: They have a snack bar and souvenir shop for your convenience.

These are genuine art pieces at affordable prices, hand made right there in the shop. They have everything from tiny souvenir pieces to rather large urns and sculptures.

Amazing History and Stunning Views,"The Acropolis is by far the most significant attraction in Lindos. Be aware that the climb from the village up to the Acropolis is long and rather steep, and may not be suitable for everyone. NOTE: There are donkeys available to ride almost to the top for a nominal fee . If you decide to go, you won't be disappointed. For a small entrance fee, you will be treated to some of the most gorgeous views anywhere in Europe. I spent a solid hour at the summit and could have stayed longer. The historical significance of the Acropolis and associated temples and buildings is also amazing. We had a tour guide but I'm sure you can conduct a ""do it yourself"" tour as well.

Another Greek Paradise,"We spent several hours here during a cruise ship excursion and my oh my were we impressed! The Greek isles have many stunningly beautiful places and Lindos is one of the most gorgeous and historic you will see. The village sits high on a mountain, which made it a virtually impregnable fortress down through the ages. Through the centuries, Greeks, Turks and others have used Lindos as a strategically important city from a religious, cultural, governmental and military standpoint. Today, this small village is alive with thriving restaurants and shops. They certainly have their share of ""trinket shops"", but you can also find high quality Greek goods like fine linen and leather items. If day tripping, be aware that the streets are rather steep in places and the walk into town from the bus station is also very steep. I recommend using a cab for the steep climb back up to the buses. If you are interested in staying here, they have some amazing hotels and gorgeous beaches adjacent to the village.

The house has been excavated and you can see where He actually sat, prayed, and ate meals. Incredible! The site also includes an excavated Jewish synagogue, so you can get a feel for worship practices of the Jews in those days. This amazing site has a working church, so be aware you may have to vacate that church above “Peter’s mother in law house” during worship services.

The doors themselves are a wonder to behold. Once inside, there are several treasures to explore. In the large sanctuary, there are numerous incredible paintings and mosaics from numerous countries dedicated to Mary. On another level, you can view the grotto where Gabriel appeared to Mary.

Men and women pray on different sides (men on the left, women on the right), so be prepared to split up and rejoin your group. Men,be sure for me to grab a yamaka from the kiosk as you approach the Wall as men are REQUIRED to have some sort of head covering.

Seeing and walking where Jesus actually walked, and more importantly where he was crucified and raised from the dead, was awe-inspiring beyond words. While I am certainly glad I did it, there were several disappointing facets too hard to ignore. The crowds were terribly oppressive and at times downright scary. Because of the throngs of humanity, it was impossible to spend more than a few minutes viewing and soaking up each site.

There are actually several churches under the one roof that meet and have regular services. We really enjoyed the Catholic church, which is located through a separate doorway into a beautiful garden area.

We dined on the daily special which was linguine with monk fish. My wife had a wonderful pizza and we enjoyed the bruschetta as an amazing appetizer. If in Murano, this is YOUR place for a great meal!",October 2019,B Restaurant alla Vecchia Pescheria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g681249-d1413346-Reviews-B_Restaurant_alla_Vecchia_Pescheria-Murano_Veneto.html,"Murano, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Yummy Gelato,"This is a nice place to grab a tasty gelato as you walk around Venice. Lots of great flavors to choose from, and the prices are quite reasonable.",October 2019,Gelateria Al Teatro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d4874582-Reviews-Gelateria_Al_Teatro-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Make Time to Do This! What a Show!,"If you can and the schedule works out, you MUST make time to see an opera or some other live performance at this gorgeous and historic opera house. Teatro has an amazing history. As you enter here, you feel like you are actually ""going back in time"". The theater is very chic and warm all at the same time. They offer wine, coffee and snacks before the performance and during intermission. We were fortunate to attend a performance of La Traviata, one of the most famous Italian operas. The theater shows English “sub titles” above the stage to help you ""interpret"" the Italian opera lyrics.",October 2019,Teatro La Fenice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d207094-Reviews-Teatro_La_Fenice-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Canal-side Dining with Good Food,"We stumbled onto this place during our last evening in Venice. The setting is amazing, situated beside a quiet canal. Several gondolas will drift by during your meal. We had the lasagna and cheese plate. Both were good, not great. Be aware that their house wines are just ok, so I suggest you order something off of the wine list. Bottom line, the setting is great, the food is just good.",October 2019,Sempione,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d1034691-Reviews-Sempione-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Renaissance Art at its BEST!,"If you can, try and budget some time to visit this really nice museum. The museum is in the Dorsoduro area, across the Academia Bridge from the very busy touristy areas of Venice. You will be treated to amazing Renaissance art including incredible works by Bellini and other famous masters. We really enjoyed the signature Venetian pieces featuring incredible paintings of ancient Venice. NOTE: Try to avoid the crowds since the museum only allows a certain number of patrons. They also require a bag check for backpacks and larger bags. There is nearby gondola station for a nice, quiet gondola ride before or after your visit.",October 2019,Gallerie dell'Accademia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d194254-Reviews-Gallerie_dell_Accademia-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.0
Canal-side Dining and The Bridge of Sighs,"This is a really quaint restaurant in a unique location. They have outside tables (I highly recommend you try and get one) that sit right along a quiet little canal where gondolas come by from time to time. The place is really magical at night. From here, you can actually see the famous Bridge of Sighs down the canal from where you are sitting. The food is good but not great, but they do take good care of you with excellent service. We had the porcini mushrooms pasta and calamari. Both were good, but not the best we had in Venice.",October 2019,Osteria Calle 21,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d10685913-Reviews-Osteria_Calle_21-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.0
