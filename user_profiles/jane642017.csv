A Rug Shop in Disguise,"An extremely disappointing visit I assumed, quite incorrectly, that we were going to see some art, but the group we were with were ushered into a room where the sales patter began.

I have seen this guise many times in various countries, and this was a rug shop that also sold other, over priced, bric a brac upstairs.

First & Last Time!,"Sadly, our Virgin flight (Premium Economy) to Dubai was cancelled due to technical issues and the lovely Virgin staff got us onto an Emirates flight (Economy) we thought great as they have won a number of awards. How wrong we were.

We were on a A380 plane - Emirates doesn’t have a Premium Economy section so we were herded into a very crowded Economy class.

My husband’s seat was broken and he had to sit bolt upright all night and there was very little leg room.

To compound the trip from hell, there were no vegetarian options on the in flight dinner menu and one was unable to order in advance. A very caring Steward did manage to find a fruit platter for me. How can an airline not have a non meat or fish option on their flight? My husband’s chicken concoction looked and tasted foul and the barley salad starter was equally disgusting.

I think all of the good reviews that Emarites receive are from customers that are fortunate to fly either Business or First Class, certainly not from the overcrowded, cheap seats.

Beware of hidden supplements!!!,"Saffron was part of our Platinum package at the Atlantis meaning that we did not pay extra or supplements to eat here.

On booking a table, nothing was said, but on going to dinner, staff tried to charge us a supplement. We explained our package, but the staff and management would not concede. Admittedly, it was the week of Chinese New Year, but that was never mentioned.

We were embarrassed and walked away from Saffron.

It was the principle of having to pay more for dinner, that we had already paid for.

"Bit noisy, but excellent food choices","This restaurant was a breath of fresh air. Our waiter, Nuwan, looked after us very well whenever we eat in this particular restaurant.

The food choices and the way in which the food is displayed is phenomenal. There was never any mess from spilt food. I discovered, on one particular evening, that the restaurant had1,300 covers - that takes some doing.

A good recommendation is to eat outside, it is less noisy

Check in at Rhodes was one of the worst airports I have ever experienced even although we had boarding passes it took 2 hours to get to boarder control and the another wait of about an hour.

The interior was lovely, very different to how I remembered it.",August 2018,Plymouth Arms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186460-d953087-Reviews-Plymouth_Arms-Cardiff_South_Wales_Wales.html,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Pleasantly surprised,"Spent a good couple of hours with four children who found plenty to occupy them.

The staff were marvellous and explained things to the children as well as speaking in Welsh to the two older kids (both Welsh speakers).

It’s great to have free entry to somewhere so interesting.

My only complaint was that I spent a fortune on a lovely MelinTregwnt blanket - couldn’t resist it!",August 2018,National Wool Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2456156-d1792506-Reviews-National_Wool_Museum-Dre_fach_Felindre_Carmarthenshire_Wales.html,"Dre-fach Felindre, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
One hell of a day!,"Free entry - always a good way to kick off the day, meaning that the children could be indulged in painting a home for ladybirds. The walks and play areas were fab.

Kids saw water buffalos and many different birds and didn’t complain once about walking - they had such fun.

Lunch was good, busy but still good service.

Well done to the team at the Welsh Wildlife Centre - you have an enviable product.",August 2018,Welsh Wildlife Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g4473228-d2294532-Reviews-Welsh_Wildlife_Centre-Cardigan_Pembrokeshire_Wales.html,"Cardigan, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
A must when visiting Cardigan,"We always head here when on holiday in the area. Fab, freshly made pizzas, lovely atmosphere and great for all ages. They have certainly put Cardigan on the map - we went on a Monday night and it was really busy.

Good tip - if you have family, go early to get a big table either in the tipi by the log fire or outside overlooking the river.

Loads of really big fish in the Teifi to spot - makes a great game for children.",August 2018,Pizzatipi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g316011-d3334038-Reviews-Pizzatipi-Cardigan_Ceredigion_Wales.html,"Cardigan, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good Sunday Lunch,"Great Sunday lunch if you eat meat, but poor vegetarian choice as food not this seasoned as well as it could have been.

The group I was with thoroughly enjoyed their lunch - service was good although they were really short staffed and the lady running the show did an exceptional job as did the cook.

Well done guys, you were really busy!",August 2018,The Bunch of Grapes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580438-d3586690-Reviews-The_Bunch_of_Grapes-Newcastle_Emlyn_Carmarthenshire_Wales.html,"Newcastle Emlyn, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Humble by Name Only,"This was our first visit to this lovely little restaurant, and by no means our last!

The food was unpretentious, beautifully presented and served with love. This is one place to which we will return again and again.

Our dining experience was brilliant, it certainly helped with staff able to talk about the food and how it was cooked - I’ve never seen a humble carrot cooked three ways as a starter, truly inspiring for a vegetarian.

The meat dishes were also excellent, my husband ate the belly pork and thought he’d gone to heaven. His highlight was the mash - the trouble chef had gone to for something so simple but also, in many cases, so bland.

A lovely dining experience - thank you.",August 2018,The Humble Onion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3446576-d12618074-Reviews-The_Humble_Onion-Dinas_Powys_Vale_of_Glamorgan_South_Wales_Wales.html,"Dinas Powys, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Reasonable Day out,"After previously seeing how run down Oakwood was getting, I was pleasantly surprised to see that money had been spent in a transforming the attraction up to a reasonable standard.

Many of the bigger rides were not open, which was disappointing and one could not get a coffee at 10.30 as the staff had only just switched on the coffee machines - lost revenue!

I did feel that the fast track system caused anger amongst people queuing for rides - this set up an elitist, badly organised segregation of punters, who, incidentally, had paid a lot of money in entrance fees.

Staff were pleasant, but the whole set up was lacking in lustre - I do realise that it is not Disney, and never will be, but please - get all of the rides running from opening to closing time and try to cut down on the queues",July 2018,Oakwood Theme Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2550689-d296698-Reviews-Oakwood_Theme_Park-Canaston_Bridge_Narberth_Pembrokeshire_Wales.html,"Canaston Bridge, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,3.0
A Foodie’s Paradise in Wales!,"From start to finish the taster menu was out of this world.

I ate a vegetarian option and my dining partner had the meat and fish - whow!

Nothing was too much trouble and the flavours were to die for. There are some excellent palates in the kitchen, but none more than chef’s daughter - Georgia. She invents some wonderful pudding combinations which is amazing for one so young.

This family run business is certainly worth a visit if you are staying in or around Cardiff.

The restaurant can be found on the seafront of the pretty Victorian town of Penarth - an excellent backdrop to an excellent restaurant.",July 2018,Restaurant James Sommerin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g609086-d6651984-Reviews-Restaurant_James_Sommerin-Penarth_Vale_of_Glamorgan_South_Wales_Wales.html,"Penarth, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Fed up with Motorway food - this is Worth a de-tour,"We were going to stop at a motorway service station for a break and somthing to eat when we saw a hand written sign for a pub with grub (we actually found out that this was the pub across the road!)

Ended up having Sunday lunch and watched some football with the locals.

What a lovely, friendly place with simple well cooked food. Staff were marvellous.

East Isley is a hidden gem, what a beautiful place.",June 2018,Crown & Horns Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3723848-d3696579-Reviews-Crown_Horns_Inn-East_Ilsley_Berkshire_England.html,"East Ilsley, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
