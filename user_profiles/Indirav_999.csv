Disappointing,First of call it is COVID time so we ordered to go. We ordered seven items online and had instructions. No attention was given to the instructions. For example we wrote shredded chicken for the tacos and they completely missed it. We called and the lady at the reception was not even apologetic. We had to drive all the way back for their mistake because they don’t have delivery service. We didn’t have the time to reorder and that was disappointing.,November 2020,Dos De Oros Taqueria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g44535-d2426502-Reviews-Dos_De_Oros_Taqueria-Kansas_City_Missouri.html,"Kansas City, Missouri",restaurants,2.0,4.5
disappointing,"Perhaps it maybe the COVID time, we ordered a carryout and were extremely disappointed with the meal. It was smaller quantity, food was undercooked and very salty.",November 2020,Carrabba's Italian Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g38969-d390768-Reviews-Carrabba_s_Italian_Grill-Overland_Park_Kansas.html,"Overland Park, Kansas",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Unsure,We ordered Door Dash delivery. My son ordered Fajitas and they forgot to include tortillas. When we called back they sent another order. But i gave them 3 because the food was actually good. May be they just forgot to include tortillas with the Fajitas this one time. SO just let them know or remind them to add those when you call in.,October 2020,MaMa CiTa's Mexican Cantina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g44751-d17435463-Reviews-MaMa_CiTa_s_Mexican_Cantina-Osage_Beach_Lake_of_the_Ozarks_Missouri.html,"Osage Beach, Missouri",restaurants,3.0,4.5

CREPES,Its the best Italian buffet you can enjoy starting with salads which includes hash browns to the pastas and pizzas at various stations. The entire dessert menu is available to choose from. The crepes are the best and always have long line but never miss tasting them. They are made to your options or choice of topping. We were there before COVID so i am not sure about the temp checks etc. Sorry,February 2020,Cinzetti's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g38969-d778195-Reviews-Cinzetti_s-Overland_Park_Kansas.html,"Overland Park, Kansas",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Nice,"Nice beach area to stroll, work out and enjoy a walk by the shore. Beware of the ""man of war"" here. Several are washed up the shore and some are even alive.

Very nice,"We had reservation for a room with two queen beds. Since the hotel was under renovation, we were offered two separate rooms at no additional cost. We checked very late and the lady at the desk was very nice. Am glad we weren't turned away or shoved into a smaller room to accommodate. The breakfast was okay (not bad). Rooms were very clean.",December 2019,Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Jacksonville - Mayport / Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60805-d1415635-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Hotel_Suites_Jacksonville_Mayport_Beach-Jacksonville_Florida.html,"Jacksonville, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.0
