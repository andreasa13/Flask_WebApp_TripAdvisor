"Loved it, definitely be back!","Even though they were insanely busy, we received incredibly good service, little problem with our 5pm booking, manageress went out of her way to oblige us.
Surprising queue for carvety quicker than expected, and the waitresses very attentive, without being intrusive.
I accidentally left my wallet on the floor, and they phoned me within a couple mins to let me know they found it, brilliant!!!!!",September 2020,Toby Carvery Clacton On Sea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503776-d2337672-Reviews-Toby_Carvery_Clacton_On_Sea-Clacton_on_Sea_Essex_England.html,"Clacton-on-Sea, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.0
Beautiful,"Absolutely breathtaking, a walk through history.
The reason for this review is to make people aware there is disabled access to the Acropolis, to the left of the entrance is a manned disabled entrance, show tickets, follow path to left and there is a manned lift, which takes you right to the top.
Thank you for this service.",December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

"Loved it, definitely coming back!","Really friendly place, room better than pictures, very spacious.
Dinner was excellent, from starter to desert, and extremely good value for money.
Breakfast is the best I've ever had, large full Irish and continental too, but with boiled bacon and chicken breast slices, I'd move in!

Staff really helpful and informative.

Lovely, definitely coming back.
