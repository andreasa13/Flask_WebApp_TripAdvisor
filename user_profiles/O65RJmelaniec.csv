"Gourmet pizza, great salads and super starters","Started off with calamari, meatballs and salads. So good. We ordered so we could do family style. The gnocchi was incredible! My fav.

"Excellent steaks, sides and salads","I took my Gators for a great celebratory dinner. My college kids were excited for a great meal...and it certainly was! It started off with a choice of tasty bread slices. We had the incredible prime filet mignon flatbread. The porterhouse steaks were excellent. I was pleasantly surprised. Especially because I ate at a NYC steakhouse the night before and I thought the steak was just as good if not better. The buttery spinach was one of our favs, along with the lobster mashed potatoes. The truffle Mac was a little bland.

Delicious pizza and waffles! Awesome outdoor picnic tables.,"Delicious deep pan pizza. Loved the squared crispy crust. The specialty pizzas were amazing (Motor City and Buffalo Bird). I took my college daughter and her girlfriends for dinner. Served in pizza boxes we asked for paper plates and sat in one of the many picnic tables. The pizza was devoured pretty quickly so we then ordered the buttery waffles. So good!

Casual and colorful style,I almost felt like I was going into a college apartment building with the pool tables in the lobby. Causal and colorful chairs and tables. Young vibe.

Charming tavern with delicious dishes,"When you walk into the restaurant it has a charming warm decor. Plexiglass divides each table. We were served humus and thick toasted bread right away. The Greek salad was solid with onions, small cucumbers and even a few capers. The grilled octopus appetizer was delicious. The seafood medley with orzo & feta was excellent and hearty. Only wish our waiter was better. He never checked on us.

Dorado delight,"I haven’t been to this property in 20 years. They did a beautiful job renovating and refurbishing the rooms and lobby. Very modern tropic. Best part is the beach! I love the alcove and the privacy of just our hotel. It took me a day to adjust to the decrepit building next door that they are demolishing. I stayed in my zone and appreciated the Hyatt property.

The delicious taste of Greece in Gramercy,"Having gone to Greece last year before COVid , I loved the vibe of white decor with splashes of blue.

Amazing Italian food and flavor,"We enjoyed a fabulous family dinner starting off with a pitcher of sangria, truffle ravioli (insane!) and seafood medley. The chicken parm was perfect.

Best burger and bone!,"My husband tried for weeks to get a reservation. We got one at 5pm! We took it. We had the place pretty much to ourselves inside. Our college age son was in heaven with the amazing burgers! We loved both the Black label burger and the Minetta burger. Probably one of our top 3 burgers we have ever had. So soft and juicy. The bone marrow was smooth and tasty. I’d never had it before, and truly enjoyed it. The spinach was a surprise side. Our waiter was excellent, Tony from Croatia, he was part of the amazing dining experience. Guillermo from Mexico, did a terrific job too.

Good food but missed the mark on service,"We took our college aged children for a great steakhouse. We had heard good things about Keens. We had a nice table inside by the wall with plexiglass dividing us from other patrons. Our waiter started off strong, but became non-existent and uninterested. Which changes the dining experience (hence, 3 stars). Our terrific bus boy, Alex from Mexico, was charming and improved our night. Getting to the food....The bacon was fatty and delicious, the crab cakes were delectable. The bread basket was average, but the carrots and celery plate with blue cheese was a nice and tasty opener. Of course we had the mutton chop, which was tasty and warm. Our porterhouse came out cold. So we kindly asked for them to heat it up. Once warmed our filet was delicious. But that’s when our waiter became nonexistent. We ended up ordering our cheesecake with Alex, because he was the one checking on us. It shows you that you can have a great steak, but you have to have equally great service to create the ideal experience.",December 2020,Keens Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d425330-Reviews-Keens_Steakhouse-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.5

"Gnocchi, nutella and Nirvana!","Located in the heart of restaurant row on Hopkins Ave, this charming and stylish restaurant had a whimsical and fun European flair. We ate inside at a high top booth in the corner. We started with the incredible truffle gnocchi, which was the highlight of the meal.
