"Food great, service slow","The food at Al Molo is 5/5. We had the squid starter which was yummy, and the pork belly which was also good. For mains, we had the lamb tortelinni and halibut. Both were great! We give the service 3/5. When we got there, they did not have a table for us. We waited wondering if it would be possible even though we had booked. It was our anniversary so we were quite worried - I had added this to the booking email. We mentioned that we had a 20% off voucher...we realised the waitress had not used the voucher once we had paid which was annoying. We sat down after 10 minutes and were asked if we wanted some water. 10 minutes later, we were asked again if we wanted water by our waitress. After that, the service was slow...we were often waiting to order. We thought our first drinks might have been free due to us not getting a table and having to wait. Though the waitress was friendlg and helpful, it was slow. We would come back if we knew the service was better.",August 2020,Al Molo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190817-d7891848-Reviews-Al_Molo-Weymouth_Dorset_England.html,"Weymouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Not great,"I visited with friends visited for dumplings on a Sunday. I visited a couple of years ago and loved it but it was a huge change when I visited a couple of weeks ago! The pastry on all the dumplings was so thick, the filling in the dumplings was mushy and bland, the meat in the rice wrapped in leaves was slimey and the service was cold (not friendly).

Always yummy,"Love this place. The food is always so so tasty!! I had a noodle dish and a coke on this visit and my friend had a rice dish. The only things I would say about this place is that the food comes at different times - surely it can be done at the same time? This is the only restaurant I know of that does this. Because it comes at different times, the food either goes cold while you wait for the other dishes or one person sits awquardly waiting fod their dish. The other thing is the staff push you to but more. I feel like this is done a little too much.",February 2020,Wagamama,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g504175-d1019726-Reviews-Wagamama-Kingston_upon_Thames_Greater_London_England.html,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Such a shame,"Good food, slow service and rude staff. We went here on a Sunday. It took a while for us to order - several times we tried to get the attention from a waiter or waitress. The food took a while to come but was really tasty. Before we had even finished, the staff started to take our plates away. We were shocked that 12.5% service charge was added. We decided not to pay it because we did not think the service was good enough. The waiter returned our money and bill and said that we had no paid enough. We explained that we had not paid the service charge. He seemed a little annoyed at this. When leaving, no staff said goodbye or smiled. Duck Duck Goose need to think about what good service it.

A lovely stay,"This hotel is really lovely. The service is good, it has gorgeous pools and is very clean. The hotel is just outside the Old Town which has lots of lovely bars and restaurants. There were a couple of annoying this that I found from our 3 day stay. Firstly, you have to wear swimming hats in the indoor pool. We were not away of this so had to buy them for €5 each. If the hotel wants everyone to wear swimming hats, why not provide them? Also, we had to pay €2 to use a locker. Silly. Secondly, we had to pay for wifi. It was not expensibe but for a 4 star hotel, I really do think this should be included. Other than these two things, the hotel is really nice and I would probably stay again.

Delicious Christmas burgers!!,"We visited Byron just last week. Everything was spot on. We both had the 'All Hail the Turkey' burger with the onion gravy and fries. They were delicious burgers and are a must at this time of year! They are basicalpy buttermilk chicken with, bread sauce, cranberry sauce and stuffing - what more could you want inna Christmas burger?
We also had the halloumi fries and Christmas baubles (macaroni cheese balls topped with bacon, blue cheess sauce and cranberry sauce) to start - so so yummy! Thank you Daniel and Mantas for the great, friendly service! We will be back asap :D",December 2019,Byron Kingston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g504175-d2421930-Reviews-Byron_Kingston-Kingston_upon_Thames_Greater_London_England.html,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.5
A real shame!,"Always loved this place but this visit was a shame! After waiting10 minutes, we sat down. We were asked to order straight away. The drinks and food came promptly. The food wasn't hot but it was so busy, we didn't bother saying anything. My pizza was a margarite with Italian ham on. There was little to no cheese on it which was a shame. Once we had finished, we were given the bill and 5 minutes later asked if we wanted to pay by card. We said we hadn't finished our drinks yet so didn't want to pay yet. We got a simple 'okay' reply back. The whold thing was very rushed - they just wanted us in and out so more customers could sit down. This is a shame as I've always enjoyed myself so much at Pizza Pilgrims. Better luck next time!",August 2019,Pizza Pilgrims,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d7291976-Reviews-Pizza_Pilgrims-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
"Great prosecco, good food.","Great bottemless brunch. They are very good with their prosecco - always topping it up snd for £18 per person, you can't go wrong! The food is good but not brilliant.

Good but could be better,"I went here over Folk Week. We booked luckily as it was busy. The mains were great - we all had the burger. Yummy! We had desserts also. The chocolate bomb was disappointing as the sauce wasn't hot enough to melt the bomb. The honeycomb cheesecake tasted like it had come from a supermarket - nkt very fresh. It was a shame because the mains were so good!! When we ordered our desserts, we ordered more cocktails. These didn't arrive. It seemed like the cocktails and the waitress had got lost. We went to the bar to have the drinks taken off the bill. The manager was happy to do so but didn't apologise - he seemed too busy to care about this. Unsure if I would return. We had nice burgers though.",August 2019,Prezzo - Broadstairs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635678-d730960-Reviews-Prezzo_Broadstairs-Broadstairs_Isle_of_Thanet_Kent_England.html,"Broadstairs, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Good but expensive,I went here over Folk Week. They had live music which was good and the general atmosphere was nice. The drinks were very expensive. £7 so a single gin is crazy. A nice pub though. I would return but have a coke instead to drink.,August 2019,The Charles Dickens Seaside Gastro Pub & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635678-d2105705-Reviews-The_Charles_Dickens_Seaside_Gastro_Pub_Restaurant-Broadstairs_Isle_of_Thanet_Kent.html,"Broadstairs, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
