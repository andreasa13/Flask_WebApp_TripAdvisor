Very Educational,"I never would have thought that Croatia is a place where they grow silk worms! This is a lovely shop with pretty items, some make with silk. We got to see how they turn silk worm cocoons into silk thread. Learning about the history and meaning of the different types of decorative silk bibs was quite fascinating. Luckily, people had the foresight to save and collect these historic, beautiful bibs.",December 2019,AR Atelier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2659007-d4610738-Reviews-AR_Atelier-Gruda_Konavle_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Gruda, Croatia",attractions,5.0,4.5
