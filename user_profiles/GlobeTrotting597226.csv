Reliable and Safe Service,"We booked a pickup at the Athens Airport to our hotel in the city. Nasos was our driver and was waiting for us when we arrived. He was very professional and safe driver. He gave us a tour of some spots to visit on our way to the hotel. He also had a bottle of water for us, a reusable tote bag and had wifi in the car. Booking process online was easy and I received email updates. I would definitely book with Welcome Pickups again on future trips. Cost was about the same as taking a taxi at ground transportation.",October 2019,Welcome Pickups,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d8609163-Reviews-Welcome_Pickups-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
An amazing part of History,"The view of the Acropolis is amazing from many points throughout the city (both day and night), however, it's definitely worth the climb and close up visit! As some others had suggested, we went early and headed to the top first and then worked our way down. We had purchased 'Skip the Lines Tickets', however, on the day we went (early October) there were no lineups. If you are not doing a guided tour, read up on the site so that you can truly appreciate what is standing in front of you!",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Minoan Route!,"We had an amazing experience on this tour. Darrel, our guide, provided us with an upfront and personal experience. He is so knowledge and a great story teller, but his sence of humor will have you laughing all day. Every stop had something unique to offer! We booked directly with Safari Club online before we left home and everything worked out as planned! We would highly recommend booking a tour with them and if Darrel is your guide, it's a bonus cause he really loves doing what he does!",October 2019,Full-Day Land Rover Safari from Heraklion with Lunch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189417-d11988602-Full_Day_Land_Rover_Safari_from_Heraklion_with_Lunch-Heraklion_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
A must see!,Meteora's scenery is breathtaking and a natural wonder worth seeing! Visiting the sites in person is better than the pictures. Our drivers were great and our guides were both very knowledgeable and great story tellers! Evangelos guided us to Delphi and Dimitri was our guide for Meteora. We felt that there was a good balance of guided tour and free time. We booked the tour online directly with Key Tours before leaving home and everything worked out as planned!,October 2019,2-Day Delphi and Meteora Tour from Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11472887-2_Day_Delphi_and_Meteora_Tour_from_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.0
Nice Relaxing Resort,"Resort is a nice large resort with a beautiful beach, lots of seating areas to relax, clean pool and a wide selection of good food at every meal! Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Thanasis, the bartender, was really welcoming and personnable. Besides pouring us some great drinks, he chatted with us each day and offered suggestions on sites to visit. Also, we arrived late, after the dining hours, however, we were still served a hot meal!",October 2019,Arina Beach Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g644208-d491529-Reviews-Arina_Beach_Resort-Kokkini_Hani_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Very Reliable and Safe Service,"I recently booked a pick up service from the Heraklion Port to our hotel. Even though our ferry arrived 45 minutes late, our driver was waiting for us! He was very friendly and gave us some travel tips for our stay. His car was very clean and he was very professional. I then booked with them online again for our pick up from our hotel to the Heraklion Airport for 4am. Again, we received the same timely and professional service. The online booking process is easy and the email communications are quick. You are given a price and you pay the driver directly. I also like the fact that they reconfirmed the 4am pickup. They provide a reliable and safe service!",October 2019,Heraklion Taxi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189417-d8770324-Reviews-Heraklion_Taxi-Heraklion_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great Location,"We stayed at this location for 2 nights and felt very welcomed by Donara. Our room was clean and as described. The hotel is very close to the Acropolis, restaurants and other sites.
