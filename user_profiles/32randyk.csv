"Nice facility, great beds and fantastic staff.","From a warm welcome when checking in to attentive staff throughout our stay to a friendly and efficient checkout our 3 day stay was very comfortable. The beds were very comfortable and the attention to cleanliness was impressive.

Disaster,"We had made reservations for a group of 20. The table arrangement was waiting for us when we arrived. It was downhill from then on. Almost 1 hour to be served our first drink. It was like pulling teeth to have the serving staff serve water. The kitchen ran out of chicken, dissapointing many in our group. We did request separate bills for each couple, which was requested upon our arrival. Not one bill was correct. It took almost 45 minutes to have them corrected. The quality of the food served was a mixed bag. Some dinners were very good others dissapointing. There is no doubt this restaurant should have done better.",March 2019,Restaurant Masala Bar & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1026781-d2011639-Reviews-Restaurant_Masala_Bar_Grill-La_Cruz_de_Huanacaxtle_Pacific_Coast.html,"La Cruz de Huanacaxtle, Mexico",restaurants,1.0,4.5

Best tacos ever.,We went in a group of 12. Great food and great service. Making a decision on what type of taco you would like is easy. Your choices are many as long as you want beef. Add the cheese and all the other toppings that they offer and there it is.....fantastico. Cost is very reasonable.

Another great meal,A group of 6 of us were at Ramone's for dinner. Most had the coconut shrimp which is always wonderful. I had the Pulpo Diablo (octopus) which was fantastic. If you are in the area do yourself a favor and have a meal here. It is family run and they consider your satisfaction their most important task. Definitely not fancy but very clean. The ambiance is half the experience.,February 2019,Ramones,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1026781-d14069223-Reviews-Ramones-La_Cruz_de_Huanacaxtle_Pacific_Coast.html,"La Cruz de Huanacaxtle, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Breathtaking site,"Unbelievable site but crowd flow management could and should be improved.

A don't miss,Well presented and extremely interesting. You will need the entire day (9am to 5:30pm) to do it justice but worth it.

Great food with great service,"Rickie, our waiter, contributed greatly in making our dinner experience here very enjoyable. His menu suggestions for each of us were bang on. Four of us ordered four very different dinners and each of us were totally satisfied with the quality. Great atmosphere, and even though the restaurant was very busy, our dinner was very relaxed. Worth a visit.",February 2016,Carrabba's Italian Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34352-d466092-Reviews-Carrabba_s_Italian_Grill-Kissimmee_Florida.html,"Kissimmee, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Great food, great service and great prices","If you're looking for fine dining this is not the place for you.... but if you're looking for great beach bar food, excellent service and local atmosphere and experience , all at a reasonable cost, this is the place.

"Awful, awful, awful","My wife and I had dinner. Her meal was served with cold fries and mine (prime rib) was served rare when medium was ordered. It took far too long to remedy the situation and when my meal was redone and served the meat was closer to well done. I had originally ordered the meal prepared as slow roasted and it ended being grilled. Service is poor and seems to be very unorganized. For what they are charging there is little value. Don't waste your time here as there are plenty of other restaurants nearby.
To add insult to injury I tried to share our experience on Outback's customer survey website but a few minutes into describing our poor experience the site timed out and suggested I start the survey over again. Another waste of time.",January 2016,Outback Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g40487-d463878-Reviews-Outback_Steakhouse-West_Monroe_Louisiana.html,"West Monroe, Louisiana",restaurants,1.0,3.5
