Wear good shoes,"The fortress and the church are not to be missed, but there is a good hike to get up to the old town. Try to go early in the morning to avoid the sun and heat.

Incredible hotel and location,"Just as they noted, if you have a car you park outside the castle gates and unload your luggage as there are no cars. We parked on the road along with everyone else, and rolled our suitcases over the cobblestones to the central registry for this hotel a short walk from the gate. Another walk to our hotel, but what a room, what a breakfast and what a great location. We had a large room with a private terrace overlooking the water (room #4?). An easy walk to everything, but away from the main tourist areas.",October 2019,Malvasia Traditional Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g285708-d4917371-Reviews-Malvasia_Traditional_Hotel-Monemvasia_Monemvasia_Municipality_Laconia_Region_Peloponne.html,"Monemvasia, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5

Great breakfast and hospitable staff,"We drove our car there, and parked up the hill outside an abandoned hotel and the old castle. Safe place to park and walk, but a little hooky nonetheless. The staff was very friendly, and our room was VERY brightly painted with lighting on the ceiling molding. We had no windows, but a door with a window that opened...also a little hooky. A short walk to all that you need to see, and the area is close by to a number of archaeological sites. The pedestrian area is AMAZING with numerous shops (silver jewelry, leather sandals and nice souvenir shops)",October 2019,Pension Marianna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g319780-d573464-Reviews-Pension_Marianna-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",hotels,4.0,5.0
Get there early,"Very impressive, but to enjoy it you will need to get there early to avoid the crowds and the heat (even in October). There are many guides to seeing the Acropolis, and we used Rick Steves. The tour groups fly through the site, but we spend quite a bit of time as this was our first trip to Athens and any of the historic sites.

Incredible,"We toured this site in October when it was cooler. The site is spread out and you will need a map of the site and some background to make the tour worthwhile. Seeing where they light the Olympic flame was amazing, not to mention the history of the site, the amount of reconstruction they have done, and the amount of artifacts just lying around.",October 2019,Archaeological Site of Olympia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189487-d243256-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Olympia-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great hotel and location,"Wonderful hotel in the Plaka and a short walk to the Acropolis. Generous rooms, great staff, breakfasts and snacks during the day.

Lovely beach,"Rented beach lounges under an umbrella and stayed about 5 hours. Shower and toilets available and a very nice taverna up the hill.

Enjoyable stay,"We stayed there for 1 night, and had lunch, dinner and their wonderful breakfast. The food and service were perfect.

Local food and customers,"When the locals go to a restaurant, you know it is good.

Quiet Location near the Rosenborg Palace and park,"Friendly and informative staff. Very accommodating. Recommendations for restaurants, mass transit and sites were all perfect. We had a room on the third floor facing the courtyard and it was very quiet. The mattress could have been more comfortable, but for a few nights, not that bad. They have coffee/tea, cookies and deserts available all day, and we even brought back a salad from a local grocery store and ate in the dining room. Breakfast only had hard boiled eggs, nothing else hot/warm.

The machines for the tickets for mass transit are not as convenient as other European cities, but the trains and buses are up to the usual European standards. 7-11 seems to sell tickets in every country in Scandinavia.",September 2017,Hotel Christian IV,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189541-d206749-Reviews-Hotel_Christian_IV-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",hotels,5.0,4.0

Wonderful stay,"Beautiful property, friendly staff, great food, great accommodations. We cannot say enough about the grounds, hotel, room and restaurant. The staff are very accommodating, parking is beneath the hotel, nice touches like 24 hour coffee, and fresh lemonade.

Cant even find the hotel on Tripadvisor,"This hotel is located at 1110 Bethlehem Pike, North Wales, Pa and has several restaurants nearby including Olive Garden. The hotel was clean, but they checked us into a room that WAS OCCUPIED. Then they moved us to a handicap room on the first floor that has a horrible hand held shower. VERY dated accommodations, and the heat was noisy. The breakfast runs from 7 to 10 on the weekend, and when we arrived at 9 am on Sunday, they were out of Greek yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, bagels, and forks. The staff made a very late effort to fill, but too little to late. This is NOT up to Marriott standards, and I would recommend to Marriott to take a close look at this facility, and kick the manager out.",November 2016,Residence Inn Philadelphia Montgomeryville,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g53354-d281414-Reviews-Residence_Inn_Philadelphia_Montgomeryville-North_Wales_Pennsylvania.html,"North Wales, Pennsylvania",hotels,2.0,4.0

Very enjoyable stay,"We arrived at the Bern train station, and went to Tourist information to find the best way to get to the Hotel. A few short stops from the City Center, and we arrived a few blocks from the hotel in a very nice residential neighborhood. The staff could not do enough and there was fresh lemonade and apples for their guests. The rooms have no A/C but even in August this was no problem. We were in the back of the hotel, so noise was non-existent but it IS a residential neighborhood so it is quiet. Breakfasts were wonderful, unbelievable coffee, but beware...you have to cook the eggs which I thought were already hard boiled. Live and learn. We opted to walk through the rose garden (what a view) down to the City and boy was it worth it. Not far from the main activities and wonderful restaurants. We picked up lunch at the Cop supermarket all through Switzerland and it was an inexpensive and flexible lunch. This hotel is wonderful with quirky things like the exercise room and art.

Wonderful stay,"We arranged to have the hotel pick us at at the airport, and this was our first trip to Prague, and probably not our last. The hotel staff could not do more during our 4 night stay. The breakfasts were outstanding, and if you get the table overlooking the city, well you could not ask for more. They also offer coffee and pastries every afternoon in the sitting room. The room was large and air-conditioned during the summer heat wave. Beds were turned down at night, and chocolates on the bed. It was away from the hustle of the downtown, and it is a few minute walk to the public transportation (which is very user even for an American couple). Very near the castle. We ate at the restaurant only one night, and when you do ask for the cocktail with Aperol. We also ate at Lví Dvůr and had the suckling pig which was phenomenal and it is within walking distance to the hotel. If the weather is nice, ask to eat on the rooftop garden.

Exceptional hotel,"We only stayed here one night on our way from Prague to Vienna, and found this historic hotel by chance. It has a great location, wonderful breakfast, and clean nice accommodations. We were on the third floor facing the river. I guess the front of the hotel would face the castle, but we were pleased with the view of the river and park. The room was air-conditioned in the summer heat wave which was needed.

"Beautiful lobby,outdated small rooms","We booked this hotel at the last minute from another one of the Logis Hotel properties (Le Christina in Bourges) on our way from the south of France back up to Paris. The Hotel has a complimentary parking garage across the street (extremely tight quarters, and we scratched our rental car), and the street level reception and dining room are very upscale. The room, however, was very outdated, and the area outside our window was noisy. The bathroom was very small and outdated as well. The breakfast was typical continental and served in the bar, not the much nicer dining room. The restaurant was very pricey, and we chose instead to eat downtown. What YOU MUST see is the light show on the cathedral. It is the most amazing use of laser lights I will ever see, and I cannot figure out how they accomplished this,and I am an engineer. Make sure you get a good map of the city (the Hotel's map is horrible) as we got lost for at least a half hour trying to get back from the cathedral. You need to go to the Creperie les Trois Lys located in the old town.

Amazing boutique hotel located above apartments.,"This hotel was an amazing property that we booked for it's location, ratings and air-conditioning (during their summer heatwave). It is located near both the metro and trolley stops, the Marriott, Four Seasons, Palace Colberg and restaurants (i.e. a great area). Walking distance to the Cathedral and the Stephansplatz shopping. The hotel rooms are located above the residences and we had a suite with 1 1/2 baths, and a view of St. Stephens. We ate breakfast at the Hegelhof Cafe near Hegelgasse, a few blocks away at their sidewalk cafe. There is a great supermarket similar to Whole Foods in the US BUT much nicer. It is Billa Corso near Neuer Markt. They make great sandwiches and they have just about everything you would need. For dinner we ate at the Restaurant Huth Gastwirtschaft.

Elegant hotel in historic building,"We booked this hotel for our last night in France before the rest of our trip. Absolutely beautiful hotel on a cliff with views (a few miles away) of Paris. We had a room on the third floor (I believe) facing Paris, with floor to ceiling windows. The room may have needed some updating, but was elegant and huge. The bathroom was all marble and large as well. The staff could not do more, and the public area were again elegant. Breakfast was pricey but very complete, and service was equally four stars.

No noise issues, and well appointed with a Nespresso machine (best coffee ever). Hotel staff could not have been more accommodating. The breakfast was one of the best on our trip with a variety of hot and cold dishes served in a very well appointed room. Not far from the Louvre, a long but pleasant walk to Notre Dame, restaurants and shopping.

The Tropicana is spending a lot on modernizing the casino, with new travertine floors and lighting. The smell of smoke was hardly noticeable, which I assume is due to their HVAC system as the casino floor was pretty busy. Dinner at the Fin restaurant was very good, while in past years was mediocre at best. My room package included a comp for breakfast, and I ordered room service.
