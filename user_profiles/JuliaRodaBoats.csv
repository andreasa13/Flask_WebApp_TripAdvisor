Absolutely worth a visit!,"We have visited several museums in Athens and this one was our favourite. It is much smaller than for example, Archeoligical museum, which makes it easier to go through. The collection of Cycladic artefacts is unique! Ancient greek collection is a overview of what you can see in Archeological musem, Cypriotic art is a pretty interesting colleaction too. Besides that, this museum unlike others has interactive activities and a couple of movies about ancient every day life, ceremonies, languages and so on. We visited in mid November and there were just a few people inside, no need to worry about buying tickets online (another reason is that then you have to pay full price instead of 50% discount which you get in november).
In general, if you have very limited time in Athens or can just visit one museum, this one would be the right choice.",November 2019,Museum of Cycladic Art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198712-Reviews-Museum_of_Cycladic_Art-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Acropolis visit mid November,"We travelled to Athens 18-23 of November and timing could not be better1 Still warm during the day (ca.20 degrees), but no heat and no crowds whatsoever! we arrived to buy tickets at 10 and there was 0 people queque. Up the hill we were not along of course but still could watch all the sites relaxedly without being pushed by people waiting behind. A tip before your trip: make sure you know the exact place to enter and to buy tickets, as it is located downside the hill (nearby Acropolis metro station).",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Can be easily skipped,"While travelling through Europe, we usually take hop on hop off bus to get to know the city. This one in Athens happens to be the one which could easily be skipped. 2 reasons:
-not enough information provided during the route, most of the time you just hear Greek music in your earphones, which is nice, but not that much, and while it can be easily substituted by some greek mythology or legends, the country has plenty of them.
-most of the route is not picturesque at all. You will pass the highlights like Syntagma square, Acropolis, National library and a few others but for the rest is just passing the Athens streets, which are not nice to see, wasting time on traffic lights and traffic jams.
We tried all of suggested routes, Athens Riviera is not interesting at all, you almost dont see the sea shore, as there are trees and tram rails inbetween the road and the coastline, so dont waste your time.
Pireus line is better.
To be fair, I d like to say that the Athens line is also the cheapest one (12 euro pp for 2 days) and the drivers are all very friendly.
To conclude, i would suggest just to take a 9 euro public transport ticket for 5 days and visit all the sites by yourself, combining with online/youtube audio guides which are now plenty available and much more informative.",November 2019,Athens Piraeus and Glyfada Hop on Hop off Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11455988-Athens_Piraeus_and_Glyfada_Hop_on_Hop_off_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,3.0,3.5
Very comfortable stay,"If you are searching for a spacious place for a comfortable stay, then this is the right place to be. Separate living room, 2 tv's (in bedroom and living room), bath tub and separate shower, kitchenette, equipped with everything needed (even the cutlery is of WMF and Sola!) and a washing machine - a super handy device when you travel for longer period as laundry service is usually quite pricy in all hotels. they provide an amount of washing powder as well, so you dont need to buy a complete pack. Lots and lots of space for your clothing. Drinking water provided every day to your room or is available in the gym. Coffee and tea you can get 24 hours a day in the lobby area.
the pool is fantastic, great view, clean and trendy.
Yes, as is mentioned in many reviews, the breakfast room is tiny and choices of breakfast is very basic, we visited in november so didnt experienced a que, but afterall, serviced suites (in Europe is usually called Aparthotel) is a bit different as a Hotel, mostly they dont even provide the breakfast possibilities, so see it as an extra, and if not willing to wait, you can always enjoy breakfast in your own room, the fully equipped kitchenette is at your disposal.",November 2018,"Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294265-d4310988-Reviews-Pan_Pacific_Serviced_Suites_Beach_Road_Singapore-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Fantastic stay, Parkroyal Pickering street","The design is very impressive, original, the hotel is covered with plants and surrounded with many fountains. It also supports the ""green"" idea, you have brochure in your room, explaing, how the hotel is efficient and eco friendly. The interior of the rooms is made in natural colours, with as many as possible wooden details.
We took a deluxe room, as it has a bath, which was huge - easy to fit for 2 persons. On the photos it looks like an open bathroom, but there is actually a sliding door in between, which is much better of course. Toiletries include besides a standart set also a toothbrushes with toothpaste and shaving set.
the location is also the best so far, comparing to other places where we stayed in Singapore. Walking distance to the center, really close to metro, Chinatown, which is full of dining options and the best shops for gifts (chinese spcialties like health and beauty products, chinese traditional pastry and so on).
very firendly and helpful stuff.
Extensive breakfast.
Try to get a room with park view, if possible.",November 2018,Parkroyal hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d5997028-Reviews-Parkroyal_hotel-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,5.0,5.0
"Great dinner, client-oriented service!","We went to this place on the last evening of our vacation and enjoyed every minute. The variety of food is superb, easy to find something for anyone: sushi, sea food, meat, italian, local (fresh prepared specially for you in some minutes). Nice atmosphere and plenty of space to be seated with enough privacy.
I would also like to specially mention the waitress who helped us, Voyce, she was very attentive, prompt, friendly and professional! tip for the management of the restauarant - dont lose this girl!

Truly disappointing,"After reading the reviews we drove 40 minutes to this restaurant, which turned out to be a big disappointment.I would be ashamed to charge nearly 20 euro for a dry piece of fish with some vegetables from deep-freeze package. The dish of my husband was enormously spicy, almost not eatable, and I understand, there are maybe some people who like it but there are also some, who don't, so it is at least decent to inform client about it and not just take the order without any caring. Both dishes were prepared and served with 0% of effort or any chef's talent. None of the waiters ever asked us how was our food. I definitely will not be back again, and what even worse for the place, i for sure will not reccommend it to my clients who rely on my unbiased opinion and travel around the island.",November 2017,Restaurante Club Nautico Ca'n Picafort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580284-d7598322-Reviews-Restaurante_Club_Nautico_Ca_n_Picafort-Ca_n_Picafort_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,"Majorca, Spain",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Not bad but also not fantastic,"I was always curious about ypical jewish quisine, so in one of our trips to lodz i booked a table in Anatewka. The interior design is very specific, but I liked it. It consists of several rooms, for me, I would suggest to make a reservation in the first room (where the bar is), as it is lighter, bigger and with more space between tables. In the second room where we were sitted, I found it a bit too close to each other. First we took soups, out of which goose was the best, and from our main courses all were quite good (we took different dishes from duck and goose). Rotshild's duck is huge! it is really half a duck on your plate! The service could be more attentive, we had to ask several times for our drinks.. and please, don't order gin-tonic there, it is not their strong side.",November 2016,Anatewka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274837-d749996-Reviews-Anatewka-Lodz_Lodz_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Lodz, Poland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
A good value and a pleasant stay,"My husband has already stayed 3 times in this hotel and for me it was the first. It has everything, what we needed during our business trips to Chojnice: central location, parking nearby, freandly and English-speaking staff. The room is not big, that is true, but clean, lately refurbished and equipped with tea/coffie facilities. A choclate on the pillow I found a very nice gesture!
The breakfast was prepared specially for us, eggs, omelet, yoghurts etc.",January 2015,Hotel Ratuszowy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g946522-d5420647-Reviews-Hotel_Ratuszowy-Chojnice_Pomerania_Province_Northern_Poland.html,"Chojnice, Poland",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Nice stay, mostly suitable for business","I chose this hotel during our visit to the Warsaw Boat Show. The reasons to do so were:
- realitively close to the boat show
- out of city center (so no problems with traffic and no bustle of any city center)
-we have stayed before at Double tree Lodz and enjoyed

For our reasons it was a good choice. If you still would like to go out or do something in the evening, please keep in mind, that there is absolutely nothing around the hotel and the center is not in walking distance.
For the rest, the hotel is good, big room, nice modern interior, big and free parking nearby, wi-fi in the room, bathrobe and sleepers, tea/coffie making facilities.
Breakfast was full of choices, however the taste (pastry and eggs) was OK. Just to compare, the breakfast in Double tree Lodz was better.
Another moment: the hotel has only 3-4 floors, but it is long! so, if your room is in the end of the corridor you will have to walk quite some time to reach it. Not handy if you forget something in the room and have to go back:) But, in regard to this, if you have problems with legs, better mention it while booking and ask a room nearby the elevators.",January 2015,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Conference Centre Warsaw,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274856-d5986800-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_Conference_Centre_Warsaw-Warsaw_Mazovia_Province_Central_Po.html,"Warsaw, Poland",hotels,5.0,4.5
Very good for 3 star hotel!,"We stayed there for 1 night while business trip to Radom. The hotel is perfectly situated in the center of the city with shops, restaurants and theater around, so if you need to kill some time, that is not a problem there.
The service in the hotel was good, English for receptionists was not a problem, they were in general pretty friendly and helpful. The room was really big, very spacious, modern bathroom with shower, complimentary water.
The public parking is available in front of the hotel, not very many places but we could park without problems. In the evening or weekend you don't have to pay.
During breakfast, coffee or tea and eggs of your choice are prepaired for you and the rest you get from a buffet.
There is a sauna and jacuzzi in the hotel and a small disappointment for me was that when I booked the room, it stated on the confirmation ""double room with access to sauna"", while in reality you have to pay for this access extra.
Except for this, pretty nice hotel of good value for 3 stars.",January 2014,Europejski Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274850-d1122884-Reviews-Europejski_Boutique_Hotel-Radom_Mazovia_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Radom, Poland",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Great attention to details, they show they care about their customer","The hotel is recently build, so everything in this place is brand-new, shiny, hip and trendy. We stayed on the 8th floor, in 1-bedroom suite which basically were 2 rooms together, with 1 as bedroom and another as sitting area. So everyhting is double there: 2 bathrooms, 2 mini-bars, 2 sets of slippers etc. Pretty nice, each of us could have his own bathroom. The bed is big and comfortable, modern minimalistic design, tea-, coffee-making facilities and nespresso machine. The spa, which is on the top floor, can be used by guests of the hotel free of charge. And it is open from 6 and till 22 so plenty of time to enjoy and relax. Music next to the swimming pool you can control yourself (choose from several channels and also adjust the volume) but if I could make one suggestion to the hotel, that would be to mute the light in the leisure area around the swimming pool in the evening a little. A very bright light is good for a gym but for relaxation in the evening a soft ""Zen"" atmosphere is more appropriate in my personal opinion.
You can choose from a wide range of extra services in spa, like massages and stuff, which I found very well priced. I mean, not cheap, but not overpriced as often happens in 4-5 star hotels. I would definitely try something from their variety of treatments if we had stayed longer. By the way, you can also come and enjoy it even if you stay in another hotel. In this case you get bathrobe, slippers and your parking is inlcuded.
Talking about parking, I saw several reviews mentioning expencive parking. As a matter of fact, there is a big public parking, available just next to the hotel, where you don't have to pay in the evening or weekend and perhaps during the day the tariffs are lower (don't know exactly as we stayed for a night).
The service is top! Professional, friendly and helpful staff. They try everything to make you feel welcome and show, that they care: you check in or check out, you get a welcoming home made chocolate chip cookie, you forgot your razor, comb or a toothbrush? no problem, we'll get one for you and it's complimentory, so all your wishes or needs will be taken care of. I personally think, it is a great concept, they take the ""service"" to another lavel and I couldn't not to appreciate it.",January 2014,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Lodz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274837-d4054245-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_Lodz-Lodz_Lodz_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Lodz, Poland",hotels,5.0,4.5
Nice place for a short stay and value for money in off-season,"We stayed at this hotel for 1 night in November. When we came in,very late, the owner was there watching tv and he came to greet us while we were checking in and that was a pleasant gesture. The receptionist spoke English and was helpful and attentive. The room was relatively big, and had a balcony ( I think, most of the rooms have balconies). We had the last room in the corridor and with that we were lucky, as we had the most of the side lake view.Keep in mind, that all the rooms (or the majority) have only side lake view, so the further away is your room from the lake, the less you see, and more of the side street. When you check this hotel on, for example, booking.com, you see the side of the hotel from the lake and you get a bit wrong impression of where the rooms overlook.
The breakfast was very simple and basic. They don't even have good coffie, or pastries. But we could get the scrambled eggs and that was a plus.
Unfortunately we couldn't use the spa,s can't leave my comments on that.
In total, quite worth the money, as I paid around 35 euro per night per 2 persons (not a clue how much it costs in summer), can be a nice stay for a night or 2 but maybe less comfortable for a longer stay.",November 2013,Hotel Anek,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274747-d1448625-Reviews-Hotel_Anek-Mragowo_Warmia_Masuria_Province_Northern_Poland.html,"Mragowo, Poland",hotels,3.0,4.0
Fantastic place to stay in Lodz.,"we have stayed in the Ambasador hotel for 1 night while visiting the boat show. It is located about 6-8 minutes drive from the expo, so for us it was very comfortable. The personnel is friendly and helpful, English is no problem. Room is big, as well as the bed, we loved the modern design. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room, bathrobe and slippers, so it makes it easy to visit the spa. Good thing is, it is included in the room rate (except for the beauty treatments and massages of course). But it was great to relax in sauna and jacuzzi after a long day. What I specially enjoyed, was the relaxing music and candles in the spa area. The breakfast was great! If they can offer a glass of sparkling wine with it, could be worth a 5star breakfast, in my opinion. What I found pity, is that there is no bath in the room, just a shower.",November 2013,Ambasador Centrum Hotel Lodz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274837-d2038721-Reviews-Ambasador_Centrum_Hotel_Lodz-Lodz_Lodz_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Lodz, Poland",hotels,5.0,4.0
Worthless hop on hop off ever!,"We came to Palma for 1 day while our vacation on Majorca. Hoping to see most of the city, we took hop-on hop-off bus which was a big disappointment. As already been mentioned in many reviews before, the audible quality is terrible! the language switches from one to another, you can hardly hear even with full volume or there is noise on the background. But actually, there is nothing to listen to! The information you get is something like: ""Now on your right you see the shopping center...10 min music...and now on your left you see the station..."".The bus goes full round in about 80 minutes but they do so just to justify the tarif because actually, except for the center, the harbour and some attractions that stay apart (like the castel Bellver), there is nothing to see! so you will drive through all the surburbs and ugly streets just loosing your time. To say the truth, Palma is a very lovely city and a very pleasant place to walk through. Because all those characteristic small streets you can not reach by a bus.
Hop-on hop-off can only be handy if you want to use it for transportation.But then be prepaired to waste some time between the stops. If you have a car, then it is no problem to visit Bellver castle as there is a parking nearby (unfortunately I don't remember if it is paid parking or not otherwise it can be an option to leave the car there and continue to the city by bus as parking in palma is a problem). Another option thoses buses are for those coming to the city by bus from other towns, as it stops just next to the station.A big advantage of Palma's hop-on hop-off compaired to some other cities is that the buses run quite frequently and till 22. If you still dare to take this tour, sit on the row behind the driver. Because if you sit on another side you will get slammed by the branches.
Another tip for those who come with the car. If you leave it on the street, the time is limited to 2 hours. however, if you are a little late and already have a fine, they have a fine cancellation option. Read the small paper which is attached to the fine for the details.",September 2013,City Sightseeing Palma de Mallorca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187463-d2021207-Reviews-City_Sightseeing_Palma_de_Mallorca-Palma_de_Mallorca_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,"Majorca, Spain",attractions,2.0,3.5
"Have been there 2 times, have mixed feelings","We have eaten at this restaurant twice during our vacation on Mallorca in September. It is nicely located next to the beach and has a spacious parking nearby(for those who can come with a car). The first time we loved the restaurant! the owners are very friendly people, menu is VERY extensive and the prices attractive too, a little lower than other places nearby. My husband and I both had paella, one black and one with seafood. They were both very delicious! Accompanied with a glass of good sangria we had a fantastic lunch. So, we decided to come back in a couple of days. The service stayed friendly as well, but this time my husband took the same paella seafood and I took a hake filet with the sause in Mallorcan style, which is a tomato sause with paprica,champignons and some other vegetables. The sause was extremely salty. That made the dish almost uneatable. Paella of my husband was neither so delicious as it used to be before and also oversalted. The portions of the dishes are enormous!(except for paella) And they are served mostly with both potatos and rice. So, that second time we were a bit disappointed. What was good is a tapas plate. Cost 6,80 euro and has a mix of seafood, chicken, champignons....If you are not a big eater, just this tapas plate can be a good meal, maybe with some fries or vegetables on a side. What is also good is that they take credit cards, what is bad is that the bottle of water costs quite expensive for the area (about 3,5 euro). In general, the place is worth a visit, I guess. Just depends on how lucky you are with your choice. Or ask in advance if the cook is in his ""salty"" mood today:)",September 2013,Restaurante Atlantic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g580314-d1488071-Reviews-Restaurante_Atlantic-Sa_Coma_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,"Majorca, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Pretty nice lunch,"We had a lunch at this place while our day trip to Palma. First of all, we were attracted by the location of course. We asked for a menu of the day, which was the choice between 3 starters, 3 main dishes and 3 deserts, plus a drink and a coffee. All together 15 euro p.p. For a starter my husband had a vegetable dish prepared in the oven in majorcan style, unfortunately I don't remember the name but I am sure if you are interested and ask the waiter, he will know what I am talking about since he was very excited and proud of this local dish and highly recommended it. I had a vichysoisse which was a cold cream soup. It was ok, but not more. For the main dish we both took spaghetti with garlic and scampi, which was good too. Dessert was pretty simple- just a choice between different types of fruit served simply sliced in a bowl. Together with the drinks and coffee we found it a good value for money. However, the portion of fries which I asked for the kids turned out to cost 5 euro. Which is of course not like 100 euro per fish like I read in other reviews but also pretty much for a plate of fried potatoes.",September 2013,Pesquero Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187463-d4589373-Reviews-Pesquero_Restaurant-Palma_de_Mallorca_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,"Majorca, Spain",restaurants,3.0,3.5
"Good location, good food but wouldn't stay there again","We stayed at this hotel in March 2013. It is located just next to the lake and a small harbour and that is all what I liked about the hotel. It has free parking nearby, which is however about 10 minutes walk. The cleaning was bad, especially the shower (see the photos). Tip or no tip makes no difference, so just save your money.The breakfast is pretty standart, bread, cakes, ham, cheese, corn-flakes, you can boil an egg for yourself, but no omelette or anything else warm. Bad quality of juices.
Another reason why I am not excited about the hotel is that we didn't feel welcome there. I do not know why. Anyway, we decided to leave 1 day earlier and when checking out the receptionist didn't even ask why we do it, so that confirmed my feelings.
The restaurant was good. We ordered several times the same meal, risotto seafood and spaghetti seafood, very tasty. Good prosecco. When it is warm you can also eat outside with a nice view of the harbour.So I would suggest to visit the restaurant but find something else where to stay at night.",March 2013,Hotel Benaco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g194935-d1392554-Reviews-Hotel_Benaco-Torbole_Nago_Torbole_Province_of_Trento_Trentino_Alto_Adige.html,"Torbole, Italy",hotels,3.0,4.5
Very good restaurant at the best location,"We ate there several times during our stay. We took the same dishes, risotto seafood and spaghetti seafood as we loved them. The prosecco is also very good. There you can also find kids menu with dishes at about 4-5 euro and the portions are quite big.

Good hotel,"We have spent in this hotel 12 days with 2 kids, one of 3,5 and another of 1,5 years old. In general I can say that our vacation was successful. However, not everything went spotless and perfect, as I have read in many other reviews. The territory is absolutely beautiful, with lots of flowers and different plants, everything is maintained perfectly. The staff and service in general are worth a compliment, attentive, well-trained, not begging for money, friendly and polite. Animation team is great, our kids had lots of fun during mini-discos. Food is good, always enough for everybody, different thema-buffets every evening. We have been to 3 a la carte restaurants of 4. Chinese we found the best, sweet-corn soup especially was very delicious. From Indian restaurant I could reccomend lamb. We also went to Italian (buffet), but that was a disappointment. I couldn t find any seafood in ""risotto seafood"", and also no salmon in ""tortellini salmon"". My husband is a spaghetti bolognese lover, he eats it everywhere, where he can, so he pretty much knows how it should taste and the one in the restaurant was far from his expectations. The deserts in all restaurants are pretty much the same as in the main building. Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to eat in Lebanese restaurant. Everywhere in the brochures it says that it should be booked the same day at the reception of the hotel at 9.30, but if you come at 9.30, they tell you: oh no, it is from 9, and now it is already overbooked.
More challenges we had with our room. It is big, with big beds, that was a plus but that was the only thing positive. Interior of the room is quite simple, the tv didn't work, the telephone didn't work. But the worst was the bathroom. First 2 days we didnt have hot water, then it was finally fixed, in a couple of days after that we had a flood, the person to fix it should have come in 5 minutes according to the reception, which took him a couple of hours. the evening was completely spoiled.
We used the laundry service. A bag full of clothes, all cleaned and ironed perfectly for 10 euro, absolutely worth the money.
The beach is big , so enough space and leisure beds for everybody, the only disadvantage is that if you want to swim, you have to walk along the long pier and that is not really handy with little kids. By the way, the swimming pool for the kids was very cold and I wish they had some small waterslides for the children to play in the water.
Hurghada is located about half an hour drive from the hotel and in my opinion, going there is not worth it at all. Ugly city. I will place a separate review about it.
From our tour operator agent we got a good advice, if you need unlimited internet during your stay, better purchase a usb in the city, 30 euro and you have internet connection everywhere.",November 2012,Stella Di Mare Beach Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297550-d1460445-Reviews-Stella_Di_Mare_Beach_Resort_Spa-Makadi_Bay_Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html,"Makadi Bay, Egypt",hotels,4.0,4.5
Wouldn't suggest to go there!,"We went there with my husband as those baths are considered to be the most traditional, the baths that everybody knows. Not many people who has never been to Budapest can name out of the blue other baths. Well, we were truely disappointed. The place is really old, very badly maintained and the sanitairy conditions are terrible. The building outside is quite nice, well stop here because nothing inside is special or interesting.

"Average food and overpriced, nothing special","This restaurant is located in the rich area with all the expensive shops and luxe hotels. That says enough. The food itself tastes good, but the same dishes you can try in many other Hungarian restaurants at a normal price. Besides that, the portions are really small! we had a 3-course dinner and left hungry! (don't get mistaken, I am a small woman of 50 kilo weight). The prices are really high for this quality and small amount of food. The prices of drinks are even higher then here in Belgium. Plus they add 13 percent for the service which is the highest rate that I have met in Budapest. I am also not sure that it was stated on the menu. In all other places that I have been to, it was always mentioned , how much they charge for the service.
