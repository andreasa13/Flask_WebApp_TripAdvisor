Almost normal breakfast,"This hotel is on the east side of I-25. It was fine, but a bit worn.

Few Guests,"For us this Hampton was located perfectly off I-25. We had a more than full day driving and arrived exhausted. A sweet lady, I think her name was Shy, greeted us and was very accommodating.
The bedroom was fine; though serviceable, the shower was aged and needs repair.
We left in the wee hours of the morning and our fresh coffee was ready.

Impressive Collection Well-Worth Seeing,"This museum is laid out well with the front room arranged starting with the oldest motorcycle in 1899 and continuing to 2021. Each motorcycle in the museum is displayed on a mirror that allows the visitor to appreciate the underside. Additionally each motorcycle has an informative panel of historic and practical information about the bike. These motorcycles come from across the globe and with only a couple of purposeful exceptions have been extensively and beautifully restored. Their beauty literally shines.
We really enjoyed the three other rooms containing motorcycles that ranged from avant-guard to racing specimens.
Throughout motorcycle sculptures line the walls with professional aerial photos Bobby Haas took for National Geographic hanging from the walls.
Many years ago we saw an impressive, large, diverse motorcycle exhibit sponsored by the Guggenheim Museum in Las Vegas. This museum is at least as good

Clarly 5 Stars,"Sometimes I struggle with ratings--is it a 4 or a 5. Not this time. The relatively-new Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum is a clear 5 stars. A short movie on the first floor orients the visitor to the museum and some things to consider going through it. Some thoughts are why is the Holocaust important, how does it speak to citizens about Human Rights, who are perpetrators, bystanders, and upstanders. Elevators or stairs lead to the third floor multi-faceted, well-done informational signage exhibits, videos, artifacts, and more including an original German transport railroad car. There is a lot of information, including but not limited to the development of and perpetuation of anti-semitism, how the Holocaust manifested in different European countries, Righteous Gentiles, and violations of Human Rights around the world.
On the second floor is the Dimensions in Testimony Theater that uses an interactive hologram of different Holocaust survivors responding to questions. The presentation is on the hour, but one must pre-arrange attendance. This can be done upon arrival to the museum.
On the first floor is the Cinemark Theater that shows Holocaust testimonies and liberator testimonies at different times. Well-worth seeing even if just stopping in to watch one or two interviews.
Plan to spend hours. We spent 3 hours and will need to return to take in the rest.

Tips:
Free to Bank of America account holders on the first full weekend of every month. Free to NARM members always.
Metered parking is hard to come by, but if you can snag a place it is .60 per hour with a 4-hour limit.

Take the Shuttle,"I am not sure why the title choices are for Skip the Line. We bought our tickets online, but still showed our receipt with the QR code at the ticket counter. That is also where one buys food to feed the animals. Buying online is cheapest way to go. The experience can get pricy, especially as you will want a lot of feed, especially with youngsters along.
We debated on driving our own car or going on the shuttle. In theory the ticket allows one to do both, but we didn't have that much time. We decided to do the shuttle and are glad we did. The driver over the 5-mile road was good and knowledgeable. In addition to explaining how best to feed each animal type, a guide points out and shares knowledge about the many different animals. We drove and stopped at least as much as one would in a car, but the animals are used to the bus coming and that is a plus. Another advantage of the shuttle is that everyone has an opportunity to sit by an open ""window"" and move from side to side to feed the animals.
We visited on a windy, cold day. There were a few empty cages in the Walk-About area, but mostly not. I imagine that for a place like this in a harsh and diverse climate like this it is an ongoing project to keep everything in tip-top repair. Unlike another reviewer, we did not find the animals lethargic. To the contrary, we were surprised that the lions were so active.
Don't miss the two giraffes in their own enclosure; so sweet. The reptile house was interesting, but somewhat lacking.
Signage about the animals could definitely be improved.
I asked where the animals came from and did not feel I got a straight answer.",December 2020,"Skip the Line: Wild Animal Safari Ticket in Strafford, Missouri",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g44943-d17403188-Skip_the_Line_Wild_Animal_Safari_Ticket_in_Strafford_Missouri-Strafford_Missouri.html,"Strafford, Missouri",activities,4.0,4.5
Why Model Like the Other Guy?,"This Hampton Inn appears new, is quite large, modern, and bright.
Our room was comfortable and fine.
They have re-instituted a hot breakfast where the guest is served. Ordering and receiving the products takes awhile, so allow time especially if there are a lot of guests arriving at the same time. The offerings are okay.
The staff we encountered seemed tired and overworked.
What really got to us is the $12 parking per night. When asked we were told that all the hotels in that area charge. Excuse me? Why be like other hotels? And why on earth charge so much? This is not Paris or NYC. Price the room to capture incurred costs.

Super Smiling Staff,"This is a Hampton Inn that knows to put the guest first. Every staff member we met from General Manager Beth to Justin at check-in to Betty, Tammy, Vickie, and others gave the sense that they earnestly wanted to have a part in our having an enjoyable stay. They all evidenced an ""of course"" attitude to whatever we asked or requested. They worked as a cohesive team.
Breakfast in these Covid-19 pandemic times had an interesting twist we had not experienced at other Hampton Inns. Everyone is offered breakfast to go in a paper bag that included fairly standard options---fruit, water, muffins, bagel. I actually forget the exact items. The interesting twist is that upon check-in you are presented with a paper where you can add other options such as cereal, hard-boiled eggs, cheese sticks, and much more. Then you can take it and eat it in your room, in the common area, or on the go. I know that they are trying to find a way under Florida guidelines to be able to offer the highly-valued hot breakfast.
Covid-19 precautions are taken seriously--from masks to cleaning. The hotel is very clean.
Our room was quiet and comfortable.
Absolutely no complaints. Will surely stay here if in the area again.",November 2020,Hampton Inn Crystal River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34162-d4688151-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Crystal_River-Crystal_River_Florida.html,"Crystal River, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.5

Alienating the Customer is Not a Successful Business Model,"WDW has reduced capacity and very strict restrictions.  There were still a lot of people, but it may have seemed even more than what was because everyone was so spaced apart.  Lines were long and very annoying due to spacing and intermittent cleaning of attraction.  Though we had an enjoyable time, to us Disney has lost some of its magic.  From parking to park experiences the attention to the guest was more lacking than in the past.  Parking is not designated as carefully to help locate the vehicle.  Staff often greeted with a smile, but it seemed forced.  There were 3 very short ""parades"" of perhaps a dozen characters walking down a main avenue, but the times were not published as to when they would come or where and when we asked we were told that when and where it happens that is when it will be.We woke early to try to get in the 1st of 2 times for a queue for the ""Star Wars:  Rise of the Resistance"" attraction.  Though we hit on it in the app at exactly the time, it was full.  We tried the only other available time  at 2 pm and then, too, it immediately came up full.  Lots of people tried and we never saw anyone succeed. After inquiring, it seems like it is a Disney state secret as to how many people can participate.  Totally inappropriate to have attractions that are not up to expected attendance. The park was at 25% and this decreased availability poor performance cannot be blamed on Covid.
Some attraction highlights:  We did enjoy the newest attraction:  Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway which was like being inside a cartoon, 3D Star Tours--The Adventures Continues was fun, Muppet Vision 3D was slapstick cute.  Perhaps a favorite was Toy Story Mania 4D shooting game.  The 30-minute Frozen sing along production is worth seeing multiple times.  We didn't have to wait and it is in a huge theatre where spacing of rows and seats between guests are very great. 
The line for Millennium Falcon:  Smugglers Run was about 1 1/2 hours long, but a very clever experience.  The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror should definitely have warning signs as the ""elevator"" free-falls drops suddenly and often--definitely not suitable for everyone.  The other line for a ride that was especially long and definitely needs a warning is Rock 'n'Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith.  It is very fast, goes upside down and vertical.  Again, not for everyone.

Disappointed,"I understand this Hampton Inn is 3 years old. It looks new with very modern interior design. One would think that good, but I found the cluster of frames in the lobby, hallways, and our bedroom not in good taste--different materials, shapes, colors, and patterns did not appeal to me. The business center was a desk in an open area just off the common room--not appealing to me. Furthermore, in the bedroom bathroom there is a motion sensor that turns on the light. May sound good, but getting up in the middle of the night, I do not want a bright light to turn on. There was a nite light, but no bathroom exhaust fan.
None of that affects my disappointment. What does? The check-in and check-out staff were not warm, friendly, or welcoming. They frequented the back office and had to be called to the reception area. Unusual for Hampton Inn.
We normally stay at Hampton Inns as well as on this road trip. They have run the gamut of how they handle breakfast, but in my opinion this one was unnecessarily using Covid-19 as an excuse. They provide Breakfast in a Box--bagel, hard-boiled eggs, small container of juice, very flimsy cutlery that could not slice the bagel. No plate to eat on. We were handed the box with a disgruntled attitude. No offer to assist, no commentary, just shove off. They were also out of dark roast coffee.
Perhaps this sounds like some minor complaining, but this was the most expensive Hampton we have stayed in over the last 4 months covering perhaps 30 hotel nights.
Additionally, the freeway noise was very loud and I don't ever remember complaining about road noise before, never mind in a new hotel.
We will not stay here again, but if you decide to note that it is at Exit 186 off I-75. There are no Hampton Inn signs on the directional Hotel signs coming off the interstate.",November 2020,Hampton Inn Forsyth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34951-d13386269-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Forsyth-Forsyth_Georgia.html,"Forsyth, Georgia",hotels,2.0,4.5
Head for Point Park,"To get our bearings, we weren't quite sure where to head on Lookout Mountain. My suggestion for anyone driving: follow signs either to Point Park or the Incline Railway. They both lead to the top of Lookout Mountain.
If you want to take the Incline Railway, you must buy tickets and depart from the bottom of Lookout Mountain. At the top at Point Park one can view the Incline Railroad and for free walk to a wonderful observation deck where one can ""see forever."" Great views. The area is residential, so all parking availability is pay to park. Also on Point Park is the Civil War battlefield Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Park. The office closes at 3 pm, but the grounds are open until dusk.
The road up Lookout Mountain is quite twisty with lots of tight turns.",November 2020,Lookout Mountain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g54946-d105134-Reviews-Lookout_Mountain-Chattanooga_Tennessee.html,"Chattanooga, Tennessee",attractions,5.0,4.5
Address captures part of the message,"After watching the 2004 documentary movie ""Paper Clips""--which I highly recommend--I really wanted to visit the Whitwell Middle School. Due to Covid-19 restrictions the railcar and the artifacts room are closed, but the trip from Texas was worthwhile nonetheless.
The address of 1 Butterfly Lane clearly reflects the poem I Never Saw Another Butterfly written by a Jewish child murdered in Terezin concentration camp. Beautiful butterflies made with mosaic designs line the walkway. There is a sign about the worldwide Daffodil project commemorating the 1.5 million children murdered in the Holocaust. The highlight was seeing the railcar in its protective building. Even though Covid-19 restrictions preclude entry, it is very emotional to see it and read the signs around.
The power of one teacher to affect change is demonstrated dramatically here. Fortunately in this case it is for the better. Wish that was always the case.
Kudos to the school and its staff for continuing to call out evil and injustice.

Before eating, the cup holding the concrete frozen custard flipped over by accident. Happily, the ""concrete"" name lived up to its reputation and the contents did not spill. Happy me.

Night Corn Maze Fantastic Fun,"We went on the last day (October 31, 2020) of the night time corn maze. It was fantastic fun. Our group ranged from 11 to 73 years old. We each had a wonderful experience. Suggestion: when they have it again next year: GO. Bring your own flashlight!
The corn is feed-stock corn and very tall. The paths throughout the maze were clean and neat. There were various stops on the routes for completing a game sheet--learning information on story boards, rub impressions, and a Maize-O-Vision station to know where you are.
They were Covid-19 compliant. Plenty of parking.
There are many other activities for young and old alike--creative playgrounds as described by others, hay stacks on which to climb, opportunities to buy pumpkins and other products.
Throughout the year there are pick-your-own fruits--apples, strawberries, blueberries--and other activities. it is 30-45 minutes from Kansas City.",October 2020,Gieringer's Family Orchard & Berry Farm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g38677-d4283676-Reviews-Gieringer_s_Family_Orchard_Berry_Farm-Edgerton_Kansas.html,"Edgerton, Kansas",attractions,5.0,4.5

House made from a Sears Kit,"This is reported to be the first Sears and Roebuck House, west of the Mississippi. It was delivered by The St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad. Railroad tracks are near the house. It was built in 1912. Look online and you can find the blueprints. The house has remained in the same family since 1912—at least until 1981 when I read a report. I don't know the current ownership status. It is amazing to see the size and designs and intricacies of this house. Clearly people are living in it. None of us could believe this was made from a kit. This is a drive-by as I doubt the owners want visitors.

Hopefully in non-Covid times it is better.,"The double queen suite was a good size, but the pullout sofa was barren of sheets or any bedding. No, there was nothing in the closet.
We had to set the a/c to 60 degF for it to go on and then it did not cool properly.
Breakfast seemed more meant for ""grab & go"" than eat there. It was sparse. I know this is the era of Covid19, but it was pretty bleak. There were boxes of cereal, but no bowls.

So Much Free Fun,"We--grandparents and grandchildren--had a wonderful experience digging for selenite crystals. It was very easy and yielded a lot. It was almost addictive ""oh, let me dig for just one more."" We spent close to 2 hours and had a lot of fun.
I read other's comments and advise which was very helpful. Here are my observations:
Go to the bathroom in Jet. The woman at the gas/grocery was very understanding. No restrooms in the dig area vicinity.
Follow the posted signs from Jet to the dig area; it is only a short distance on unpaved roads. Our GPS wanted to take us a long way around on paved roads.
Once you get to the entrance of the Wildlife Refuge, it is about a 1 mile drive to the posted, designated dig area. Drive slowly. There are many depressions in the ""salty-sandy road"". If it had or is raining, I would not go.
Once you arrive at the dig site, park, and decide where you want to dig. We dug in 3 places and had great success near our parked car.
One place we dug a very deep hole to get to the water table. Another hole we used a hand shovel, dug a small amount, and felt along the side of the hole for something sharp. The third hole we dug a somewhat flat depression and felt for something sharp. In all 3 cases we succeeded in getting many selenite crystals. These crystals are not big. Perhaps the size of one's thumb at most. The hourglass-shape is within the ""sharp"" item--the crystal itself is not in the shape of an hourglass. Something we did not realize at first.
Suggested items to bring: vinyl-type gloves to keep your hands clean, water to drink and clean the sand from the crystal, a Ziplock bag or bucket for the crystals, a piece of cardboard to sit on, a small hand shovel and even a small hand trowel. We did not feel the need for the big shovel.
