Flavors meet classy autmosphere.,"This is a fantastic restaurant if you are looking to impress anyone on a date, or business.
It's beautiful (the smoking area is outdoors setting with beautiful lights, not too smoky) The inside is very beautiful and classy. Food wise, the kitchen is spectacular. I order a pasta with beef ragu and fresh mint, THE BEST I EVER HAD.. my clients ordered fish and lamb, both great choices. Arugula salad with strawberries and balsamic dressing is full of flavors... dessert is a must! try the figs, canolini and the sorbet.
TIP: make sure you ask for the price of the wine before you order from the ones recommended, as they will try to sell the more expensive, nothing wrong with that, because they are delicouse, just dont be surprised with a bottle's price tag.",March 2019,Cantinetta Del Becco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150800-d2490627-Reviews-Cantinetta_Del_Becco-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html,"Mexico City, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.0

All the great restaurants are also at a 5 -10 min distance walk. If you are staying here, most likely you don't need a car! HERE IS THE ""BUT PART"" IT is also located at a noisy corner. Our room was at ground level and the misfortune of also having very noisy second floor neighbors. Poor insulation... Soo, ask for rooms on top floors. Suites are large and beautiful.

"""Good choice"" only needs little improvemts","This is a more modern and chic, very clean hotel.. I will break down the pros and cons ..
- Location for me is everything. We chose this hotel for the great reason that ITS ON A ROAD.. In Mykonos this is very IMPORTANT. last thing you want is a hotel in the center town where you would have to stroll luggage on cobble stones.
- Hotel is 10-15 min walk to center-town. easy to get around.
- Serves a very nice breakfast daily with great option (beyond buffet style) menu options.
- Nice small pool area
- Clean
now, here are a few cons -
- The road can get a little noisy at times. but not too bad
- Staff needs to be better trained, not the friendliest, some better than others
- No shuttles provided for beaches nor city center.
DO NOT GO IN AUGUST. TOO WINDY!
Do your due diligence for the beaches, some are too expensive to rent beds.

"""Hotel was the highlight of our trip""","This hotel is by far ONE of the best hotels in the world. Here is how I will break it down!
1 - Best view from all others in the Caldera
2- Best service ever! This is a very small hotel with 7-8 rooms. The service and crew go out of their way to make sure you are well taken care-off (BEST A TEAM Vasilicos 2018)
3 - Location is amazing and 10-15 min. walks to any place you need to go.
4 - This hotel is very silent and peaceful. You will appreciate that as you meditate overlooking at the sea, from your private terrace.
5 - Bathrooms are packed with fine personal-care products, EVERYTHING YOU NEED.
last, eat at the hotel, take the time to reserve a dinner one of the nights you are Here! The Chef is the best! I can still taste the grilled octopus, fresh sashimi with herbs and fish with a thyme sauce.. YUMMM!!!!!

Does not get worst than this...,"I have stayed in many hotels in Santa Barbara. This is the far one of the worst hotels in town. Where do I begin..

Perfect Location. Steps away from everything.,"This is a very nice boutique Hotel. It is perfectly located in the French Quarter near everything. 18 of us traveled, from the whole group, my husband and I were the ones that apparently made the best choice.
