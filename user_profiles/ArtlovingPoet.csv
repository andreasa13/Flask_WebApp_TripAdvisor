Nice resort,"I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to my room. I had two bedrooms, a kitchen and a living room. Everything was spotless. I was especially pleased to see a washer and dryer.

Costa Rican Ecology,"Mildred and Jose made me feel like part of the family as we hiked in the mountains and in the tropical rainforest. They took our group to family-owned hotels and restaurants, and I was able to purchase items made by indigenous people. One of the best trips I ever took, even though it included rugged hikes and humid heat. They can arrange your trip based on what you are looking for.

Don't trust Getaroom,"room was clean but small, maid forgot to make my bed one day, friendly staff, it was a decent place to use to explore the U.P.
