Seats like cardboard!,Always forget that the seats on Rouge are so darn uncomfortable and it feels like one is sitting on cardboard. Don't recommend Rouge for anything over 2 hours flying time.,February 2020,Air Canada Rouge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8808634-Reviews-Air-Canada-Rouge,World,flights,3.0,3.0
Loads to do and lots of FUN!!,"This was on the top of our list to do and really enjoyed our day. My only complaint would be that they allow smoking on the property! They pride themselves on being eco friendly and it is very family oriented; therefore it should be Smoke Free!! A really high kudo for such a nice clean well kept park, bathrooms and shower areas!",February 2020,Xel-Ha Park by Xcaret,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g12900715-d275031-Reviews-Xel_Ha_Park_by_Xcaret-Solidaridad_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Solidaridad, Mexico",attractions,5.0,4.5
Always enjoy our experiences here!,Lunch for 3 and once again everything was fabulous. The staff is very friendly and service fast but excellent. The quality of all the ingredients is fresh and tasty and presentation is very appetizing. 2 appetizers Springs Rolls and Shrimp Rice Wraps are our favorites. Look forward to our next visit.,December 2019,Oriental Phoenix Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154913-d707549-Reviews-Oriental_Phoenix_Restaurant-Calgary_Alberta.html,"Calgary, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Was worried about making connection.,We were over 55 minutes late leaving Barcelona - no reason given. We only had 1 hr 25 min to make our connection once we reach Frankfurt. When we landed in Frankfurt it was quite a lengthy ride to where the plane was parked and then we were loaded on buses and taken to a terminal. Thank goodness the airport has a lot of moving sidewalks as we just made our flight - literally walked right onto plane and into our seats - no lineup. This was not good on my nerves as closest I've ever been to missing a flight.,November 2019,Lufthansa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729113-Reviews-Lufthansa,World,flights,5.0,4.0
Premium Economy seats were great!,Always find it worthwhile paying more for comfort and service on longer flights. We were on time leaving Frankfurt and arrived early into Calgary. Unfortunately it was over a half hour wait for all bags to arrive on carousel and this was after going thru customs. The attendants were not overly friendly but service was decent.,November 2019,Air Canada,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8728998-Reviews-Air-Canada,World,flights,5.0,3.0
Well worth the visit.,"Stunning sights and very beautiful. It is definitely a shame that the crowds are always so thick - wall to wall people even at the end of October. We purchased a pass at the kiosk that was good for five days, 1 visit per site (Acropolis & Slopes, Ancient Agora, Hadrian's Library, Kerameikos, Aristotle's School, Olympieion & Roma Agora) and highly recommend this at 30E each. The Acropolis/Parthenon are the busiest with lots of people only interested in getting that selfie at any cost. It is really quite sad how many tourists do not take the time to appreciate and read about the ruins.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Get there early to beat the crowds!,Visited in late October around 10:30am and the crowds were already thick. Would not recommend visiting on a hot day as no shade to be found and washroom facilities are few and far away. Expect the crowds and people who only show up to take selfies - very rude and inconsiderate tourists out there for sure. If you are a real history buff the information signs are very informative when you can get near them.,October 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Family run establishment that takes pride!!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon meal here. The service, food, quality and quantity were excellent. Nice clean washrooms and well maintained establishment. Why would you go to Hard Rock Cafe (right across the way) in Athens when you could visit this fabulous family run restaurant. Will look for Maiandros again!!!",October 2019,Maiandros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2315343-Reviews-Maiandros-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Love the location,We stayed here 2 nights and would stay again. Do not recommend the breakfast buffet for the price. There are plenty of small coffee shops in area are a better value for your money and quality. We do recommend the rooftop restaurant for at least one dinner. The food and service were very good and the view is stunning! Be careful what you order as the meals are larger portions. We were a little disappointed with our room - the floor as you enter is peeling from being a poor quality laminate and the doors to hallway are extremely thin. We were woken each morning when the cleaning staff arrived for work and there was not peace and quiet after that. The room was a decent size and clean. The afternoon staff on front desk were friendly and helpful but found the morning staff to be a bit stuffy and not overly friendly. Everything we needed was within easy walking distance of this hotel.,October 2019,The Athenian Callirhoe Exclusive Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d286943-Reviews-The_Athenian_Callirhoe_Exclusive_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Very friendly efficient staff.,This place is frequented by visitors and locals. The view is the old port and lots of great people watching from tables outside under cover from sun. Ordered appetizers the 2 times we stopped here to go with our beers. Lots of people were having full meals and they looked good and didn't hear any complaints. Prices were on par with the location.,October 2019,Music Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d1576350-Reviews-Music_Cafe-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great food and service.,We were here at the end of October and were very pleased with everything. The location is just off the waterfront in old town and if eating outside - people watching is high on the list. The dishes were excellent and the portion sizes not too big. Establishment is well run and clean - even though it was getting on to the end of the season the food and service were still top notch.,October 2019,La Casa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189430-d3174280-Reviews-La_Casa-Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Clean little beach right in old town.,Visited towards the end of October and this beach was mostly deserted. There is a very small questionable change shack and no washrooms. The beach is on the smaller side but very clean in the water and on beach.,October 2019,Old Port Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g662620-d17795338-Reviews-Old_Port_Beach-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.5
Good ferry system to get to the new port!,"The little ferry runs frequently between old and new port and is way cheaper than a taxi for getting to old Town Mykonos. The ferry is well maintained, runs right on time and price is good.",October 2019,Mykonos Port,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g662620-d15124230-Reviews-Mykonos_Port-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.5
Bit of a disappointment.,Yes they look stunning in pictures but the area is quite run down and not recommended for anyone with trouble walking. When you get up close to the windmills they are very run down. Don't go out of your way to visit.,October 2019,The Windmills (Kato Milli),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g662620-d669289-Reviews-The_Windmills_Kato_Milli-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0
Fell short of expectations.,Would not recommend going in late October as they are getting ready to close for season and staff is in wind down mode. Bathrooms very untidy and out of toilet paper - not very good for what is considered a higher end establishment in Mykonos. The food was decent but service was lacking - sorry but if you are open the service and food should still be decent - you don't offer a discount for end of season so don't discount customers!!,October 2019,D'Angelo Mykonos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d3585051-Reviews-D_Angelo_Mykonos-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Food was great but service was just a bit slow,"We had a very enjoyable 3 course meal here with a nice bottle of wine - the price was very reasonable for everything we had. We were not rushed with our courses but the service was a bit slow due to the waitress being distracted by an acquaintance/friend. The dishes were a bit slow on being cleared, once the wine was opened we had to then attend to ourselves and we waited quite some time to receive our bill. The food was of a high quality and the pasta was delicious.",October 2019,Pasta Fresca Barkia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d1516149-Reviews-Pasta_Fresca_Barkia-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Fabulous fresh fruit and tasty omelettes!,"We found this place on our 2nd morning and fell in love with their breakfast; so much so that we returned 2 more times for breakfast. The staff was very friendly, location great and nice clean washroom. The food and coffee were excellent and more than enough to keep us fueled for the day! We recommend the fresh fruit yoghurt with honey and omelettes.",October 2019,Salt & Sugar Breakfast Lunch Dinner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d7998926-Reviews-Salt_Sugar_Breakfast_Lunch_Dinner-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great family run hotel!!,"Once we found the hotel we were more than pleased with everything; and each day was better. We stayed for 4 nights at the end of the Mykonos tourist season in October. Even though every day there were more restaurants and stores closing for the season the staff at the hotel continued to give us great service. The room was spacious, very clean, secure and a great location for walking and exploring in old town. If you are an extremely light sleeper you may want to consider another quieter Island; the night life in old town seems to start about 1:30am to 4:00am; the sound really tends to travel here but we were able to get plenty of rest and this is not the hotels fault. All staff were friendly and extremely helpful. Thanks to all and we look forward to our next visit.",October 2019,Hotel Carbonaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g662620-d253760-Reviews-Hotel_Carbonaki-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great sleep,"Travelled for over 18 hours and arrived at hotel in the dark. Did not look like too great of an area but were very pleased with the interior and our room.

Stunning views and great location.,We stopped in twice while in Altea. The owners are very friendly and hard working young people. Nice location right on the waterfront with easy parking across the street. Excellent coffee and a good selection of beers with tapas made fresh.

Hidden Gem - very relaxing,"We spent our last 2 full days/nights here and could not have picked a better place to end our vacation. We chose one of the cabins to stay in and found it very comfortable, clean and quiet - it was like we were in our own little country cabin and the views were super. We had breakfast both mornings and thoroughly enjoyed - the fresh baked croissants were delicious; service and quantity/quality of overall breakfast was very satisfactory. We had dinner the 1st evening in the restaurant and were very satisfied with everything. Both evenings we enjoyed before and after dinner time in the lounge with a fire in the fireplace while visiting with other guests. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.

"Fantastic Views, beer, food and service!","Our server Fonda was very informative, friendly and willing to take pictures. The view from restaurant is stunning and one we never get tired of. We have been to their other place in Canmore (Grizzly Paw) but now have a new favorite and look forward to our next visit. The Chef has a very healthy but extremely tasty menu available and we enjoyed every bite. Wally enjoyed his Mac N Cheese and said he was stuffed, my Not A Burger Burger was delicious and the dressing on side salad was like velvet on the tongue.

Do Not Miss this!,Have not been here since the 1960's; mad it took so long to get back here for a visit. As we visited in the winter we were prepared for the grounds to be a little slippery but the walk around and falls were well worth braving the conditions. Lucked out with a beautiful clear sunny day which made viewing these falls even more stunning.

Love Chef choice menu!,Welcomed by Jesse and had our choice of table as was not a busy night. Specials and the overall menu explained and all questioned answered to the fullest. Jesse recommended that for the few extra $ we go with the Clayhouse Petite wine and it was a fabulous recommendation. We had the game meatballs and mushroom appetizers and both were delicious. For the main it was Wild Boar Chop and the fresh catch of the day and can not say enough about how much we enjoyed these.

Ralxing perfection!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our time here and planning on making it a yearly visit! We upgraded to a lake front Junior Suite and were more than comfortable. Enjoyed the outdoor heated pool and hot tub as well as walking around Lac Beauvert just outside our suite. For anyone not looking to walk back and forth between accommodation and main building they have a shuttle on demand; we walked and found it was not far or difficult. The first morning of our arrival we were fortunate enough to see male Elk wandering the property.

Night tour is the best!,We did a Viatour Exclusive Access Colosseum Night Tour with Underground Dungeons. It was very easy to find the meeting place and the guide was excellent. The whisper audio system was great and never once had a problem hearing or understanding the guide. Tour started out and about 5 minutes into it the lighting and thunder started. Well what a show we had. Unfortunately the rain started up and then marble size hail for about 20 minutes. Guide got us under cover as soon as possible. Unfortunately the Dungeons got flooded and that part was cancelled (we got refunded for that part). The remainder of the tour went on as planned and would highly recommend.,October 2018,Colosseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d192285-Reviews-Colosseum-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5

One night only,"Just a lay over in between flights. The door is a bit thin and you can hear noise from the hall (doors opening and closing - busload of orientals getting off elevator and nattering away to each other loudly - very inconsiderate nationality in my opinion!).

Fantastic views and an easy ride!,We do this ride about 4 times a year and notice something new each time. Recommend starting at the Canmore Visitor Centre where there is plenty of free parking in the Legacy Trail (marked with signage) parking area. Expect to take approximately 2 hours to complete a round trip unless you are a super biker. Do not feel like doing the round trip - that is easily taken care of with the bus that runs in between Canmore and Banff and accommodates bikes.

Nice way to soothe the muscles after a 100km bike ride,Never been here that it has not been crowded; but the muscles are always happy after a good soaking! The facilities are very clean and well attended. In this day and age you have to expect crowds in such a beautiful location and of course families with kids.

The beach is not dog friendly but if you go just out of the park you can take your dog on the beach. We could not get over how far out the tide goes and then when you reach the water - it is not deep at all for quite a distance. Park is very clean with loads of campsites.,May 2018,Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g181779-d1014396-Reviews-Rathtrevor_Beach_Provincial_Park-Parksville_Vancouver_Island_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",attractions,5.0,4.5
Sea Lions are very entertaining.,We went to get fresh fish for our dinner at the French Creek Seafood store and discovered they have an area were Sea Lions congregate. What fun and did not have to fight the crowds to watch like in San Francisco at Pier 51! Lots of fishing charters and tours available from this harbour.,May 2018,French Creek Harbour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g181779-d13753471-Reviews-French_Creek_Harbour-Parksville_Vancouver_Island_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",attractions,4.0,4.5
Stunning Falls - very picturesque!,Plenty of parking available with nice well maintained washrooms before and after you hit the trail(s). We took our 14 year old dog and she enjoyed the shade and a little dip in the river above the falls. Love walking among the trees with the sound of rushing water and the falls are amazing - especially how much water rushes through such a narrow channel!,May 2018,Englishman River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g181779-d9820102-Reviews-Englishman_River-Parksville_Vancouver_Island_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",attractions,5.0,5.0
Early birthday lunch for 4,"Decided to find a different place to eat in Edmonton that was open for lunch on a Saturday.We found Meat, a nice deli with a good menu both for food and liquor. Food was pretty good, both taste and portion size. Recommend the brisket sandwich with garlic fries. Casual and good service.

Best Calamari ever!,"Have not been here for quite a while so very pleased that it is still an excellent restaurant. The staff are always very friendly and service is top notch. We shared the Calarmari and enjoyed every bit of it. Husband had the lamb shank and commented on wonderful flavour and tenderness. I went with the spaghetti and meat sauce (wild boar was one of the meats) and it was so tasty! We both had our own Tiramisu which we would also recommend. Thanks for another wonderful dining experience, we will be back!",February 2018,Bonterra Trattoria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154913-d702252-Reviews-Bonterra_Trattoria-Calgary_Alberta.html,"Calgary, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
1st time here and will be back!,"Two in the group had Rueben sandwiches and thoroughly enjoyed every bite. It is a big sandwich with more than enough french fries (if you need more fries just ask) and so tasty! The other two had ribs - both highly recommend for the flavour and tenderness. You can order the ribs with 2 sides of your choice - I had the home coleslaw and baked beans - excellent! The restaurant is clean, comfortable and staff is so friendly you feel like one of the family.

On Time and great staff,"We enjoyed our Air Canada Vacations flight February 12th to Huatulco, Mexico. Very fortunate that weather allowed us to fly without any difficulties. We pulled away from the gate on time and landed ahead of schedule. The crew was very friendly. As always my number one complain with flying Air Canada Rouge, Jazz or Air Canada is the seats in economy are never very comfortable. It is as if you are sitting on plywood after about 1 hour in the air.",February 2018,Air Canada Rouge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8808634-Reviews-Air-Canada-Rouge,World,flights,4.0,3.0
Totally Relaxed!,"After an easy check-in we were taken by golf cart to our suite which was everything we could have hoped for. Accommodations were clean, bar fridge fully stocked, bed and linens extremely comfortable and the view from our patio was stunning. If you are not into walking the transportation is always available; but encourage everyone to walk as lots of beautiful grounds to see and of course good exercise. The staff in all departments are very friendly and helpful and English was never a problem. We did find that the main buffet was better for breakfast than the Mexican (service and selection). Would not recommend the Solarium al la carte (steak). The other al la cartes are okay but do recommend the Mediterranean.We did also enjoyed all 3 of the evening buffets we attended. The free onsight activities are excellent and a big kudos to the crew in charge of water sports! Enrico taught us how to sail a hobi cat within 30 minutes and then we were off and away. Thoroughly enjoyed our 2 weeks and look forward to our next visit. Thanks to all the guys at the main bar especially Vladimir!",February 2018,Las Brisas Huatulco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150789-d268104-Reviews-Las_Brisas_Huatulco-Huatulco_Southern_Mexico.html,"Huatulco, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
The Royal Castles - excellent!,Was a chilly overcast day with rain in forecast. The tour was excellent from start to finish. Our guide Christine was very informative and helpful. Plenty of time to see things at both Linderhof and Neuschwanstein Castles and a nice break in Oberammergau. The walk up to Neuschwanstein is steep but did not take us more than 30 minutes so do not rush up like we did. Enjoy a nice lunch in town with a refreshment. We walked farther up to a bridge that provides a magnificent view of the castle - even in the rain.,October 2017,Gray Line SIGHTseeing Munich,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187309-d1763981-Reviews-Gray_Line_SIGHTseeing_Munich-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,"Munich, Germany",attractions,5.0,4.0
Mo Mo appetizer is fabulous!,"It takes 20 minutes for the Mo Mo but was more than worth it. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Easy to find as you leave Temple Bar, very clean restaurant and semi busy for a Monday. We did not need a reservation but perhaps on Friday/Saturday would recommend. The entire meal was delicious and spicing right on. Also recommend the garlic naan.",October 2017,Kathmandu Kitchen Nepalese & Indian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186605-d3742785-Reviews-Kathmandu_Kitchen_Nepalese_Indian_Restaurant-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Worth the visit,Try and go in low season as even on a Monday in October was busy. Lots of interesting facts to read before actually viewing the Book. Can actually see that the books in case are written on leather. The Long Room is also amazing and quite moving.,October 2017,The Book of Kells and the Old Library Exhibition,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d215062-Reviews-The_Book_of_Kells_and_the_Old_Library_Exhibition-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
