Great tacos and great service. Good place for vegetarian items.,"Great tacos and great service. Wonderful location about three blocks from the main plaza. There are many wonderful vegetarian options. The papas al horno are a favourite, but all the other tacos we tried were also excellent.

Amazing food and service,"A wonderful Italian restaurant about three blocks from the central plaza. We stumbled across it as we were walking to where we were staying. We love Mexican food, but felt we needed something a bit different for a change. The menu is traditional Italian. We had a caprese salad that was one of the best ever. We also enjoyed an amazing homemade ravioli and a thin crust pizza. The garlic bread was also great. We will be going back to try the some of the seafood on the menu. Good wine selection as well. Many at very reasonable prices. The service was amazing and helpful. Don’t worry if you don’t speak a lot of Spanish as the staff were very fluent in English. The interior was very comfortable and pleasant. Will definitely return.",February 2020,Mare Nostrum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g151932-d1602245-Reviews-Mare_Nostrum-San_Miguel_de_Allende_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html,"San Miguel de Allende, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Renovated and wonderful,"Located on the central main square and newly renovated, this hotel was a great place to stay. The location was great and although other reviewers commented on noise at night, we did not hear anything and our room looked over the square. In fact, the town is surprisingly quiet at night. We took a tour that started at 9 pm and found that there were not many other people around. We found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. I would recommend staying here. This town is very picturesque and definitely worth the visit.",September 2019,Hotel OLDINN,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274688-d277629-Reviews-Hotel_OLDINN-Cesky_Krumlov_South_Bohemian_Region_Bohemia.html,"Cesky Krumlov, Czech Republic",hotels,5.0,4.5

Potsdam tour - highly recommended,"This was our first Fat Tire tour, but won’t be our last. The tour company is efficient and provides all the information required.

"Good food, lots of conversation, great service","A great place for dinner in Charlottenburg. Extensive menu, attentive and friendly service. The caprese salad was very good as was the orchiette pasta with sausage, tomatoes, chilies, garlic. The ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach was good if a little bland, but that is common.

Decent choice in Charlottenburg area,"Loved the location, nestled in a quiet neighbourhood. Great patio and nice interior seating as well. Service was great and the wait staff were helpful and friendly. The chicken tikka was great. Nicely spiced (medium heat). The lamb with mushrooms and tomatoes was slightly over cooked, a mild/medium spiced heat. The rice and naan were both good. Worth it to sit, watch people go by and have a meal.",September 2019,Rasas Indian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d802011-Reviews-Rasas_Indian_Restaurant-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Deserves to be top rated,"Wow! One the best meals we have had. We usually go to Keystone Alley which is very good, but the Red Rabbit was recommended by a friend. I feel I owe them a bottle of nice wine as the meal was outstanding. We had the Prix Fixe Menu before the theatre (5 to 7). A la carte can be had afterward. I started with a Frisée salad and then had a crispy duck leg on a bed of mixed vegetables, mushrooms and pickles. Both were to die for. My wife started with a torn mozzarella and pickled rhubarb salad, which was also amazing. Don’t be put off by this unusual combination, it was so amazingly good. There is an extensive wine and cocktail list. Apparently the beer menu changes frequently. I tried a couple of local beers and loved them, particularly the Herald Haus H2 ale. Highly recommended. I also recommend making a reservation so you won’t miss out.",June 2019,The Red Rabbit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155015-d8441671-Reviews-The_Red_Rabbit-Stratford_Ontario.html,"Stratford, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Definitely worth it - make a reservation,"Three of us had a great dinner. I had the Lingcod, which was absolutely amazing. Perfectly done and delicious. Fish is so often over cooked, but not here. I would go back just for that. The other two meals were also very good. A shrimp dish made to order and the burger were also very good. And don’t forget the bread and spread. Outstanding.

Buy tickets for the museums before you get there,"We knew to buy tickets for Tikal National Park at a Banural before we arrived, but didn’t know we also had to buy tickets for the museums. Our own fault, but disappointing nonetheless. Loved the park and recommend going.",March 2019,Tikal Museum / Museo Sylvanus G.

"Walk, bike, taxi or drive, but go - the food is terrific","The short walk, tuk tuk or taxi ride to the South end of Antigua is totally worth it. We went twice, because we enjoyed the food so much. The first time we had pizza, which was amazing. The second time we had the Mediterranean platter which had humus, guacamole, grilled veggies and the best oven roasted flat bread ever. We also had a veggie sandwich on sourdough bread, wonderful oven roasted potatoes and a salad. Both dishes were amazing. There are lots of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free choices as well. There are guided tours of the farm to be booked a day in advance.

Don’t forget the tickets for the park and the museums before you go.,"The park is great as everyone says, so I’ll stick to some suggestions. First buy tickets for the park in advance at any Banural location. If you are in Antigua first, there is a less busy Banural on the second floor of a building on the corner of 3a Avenida Norte and 4 Calle Oriente. If you want to go to the museums at the park, you also need to buy tickets in advance. There is a kiosk at the airport in Flores if you are flying to the park. FYI, it is an hour to 1 1/2 hours drive from Flores to Tikal. Hope that helps. It is so worth it.",March 2019,Tikal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g292015-d10736302-Reviews-Tikal-Tikal_National_Park_Peten_Department.html,"Tikal National Park, Guatemala",attractions,5.0,5.0
If you’re tired of ‘tipico’ try this place,"This restaurant serves all manner of crepes. Traditional French, but many others, savoury or sweet. The sign at the door reads that the restaurant has the best cooks, but the worst patio. In reality, the food is very good and the roof top patio is great. This restaurant was recommended by a Guatemalan couple and we were very glad we went.",March 2019,Luna de Miel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295366-d2403235-Reviews-Luna_de_Miel-Antigua_Sacatepequez_Department.html,"Antigua, Guatemala",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"View great, food good, shuttle a problem","This small place is worth a visit, the food is decent and there is the view of the valley. You can hike up, but it was a very steep 3 Km from the bottom. You can catch the shuttle from Nim Po’t Textile Centre on 5a Avenida Norte for 10 Quetzales return. We had been informed that the shuttle goes every 20 minutes. Waited 30 minutes for the pick up at the store. Should have clued in at that point, but we were on holidays and thought a few minutes wasn’t a big deal. When we arrived at the Cerro, was told that when we were ready to leave, all we had to do was ask the waiter to call and the shuttle would arrive in 20 minutes. An hour and a half after calling, it arrived. All it would have taken was a bit more communication, could have ordered an extra beer to while away the time or called a taxi.",March 2019,Cerro San Cristobal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295366-d7374716-Reviews-Cerro_San_Cristobal-Antigua_Sacatepequez_Department.html,"Antigua, Guatemala",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Wonderful place to see and stroll through,"I loved this place. Rather than start at the luxury hotel, enter the museum on Avenida 1a and begin your tour at the old pharmacy museum. The entrance fee here is 40 Q, versus 48 Q at the hotel, unless you are staying at the hotel, which gives you free entrance. You walk through many ruins of churches, a convent and crypts, but for me the highlight was the PreColumbian exhibit of statues and pottery curated by subject and situated beside modern glassworks. For example, ancient statues of eagles were beside a modern glasswork of an eagle in the same display case. There are equally impressive displays of snakes, rabbits, crocodiles and other subjects. Wonderful curation. Highly recommended.",March 2019,Paseo De Los Museos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295366-d4607989-Reviews-Paseo_De_Los_Museos-Antigua_Sacatepequez_Department.html,"Antigua, Guatemala",attractions,5.0,4.5

Intriguing as you walk by,"The bubbling pots of stews, soups and cauldrons full of ribs, rice, beans and plates of fish and spinach pies at the entrance was enough to entice us into this restaurant for dinner. The four of us tried the chicken in black bean sauce, pork stew, ribs, spinach pie, rice, beans to name a few. The ribs were good, the chicken was deemed okay, the spinach pie was good as was the bean and rice dish. The pork stew also got mixed reviews. Some of the rice dishes were dry. For 80 Quetzals you had one main and two sides. The service was good and the explanation of the dishes was very helpful.",March 2019,La Cuevita de Urquizu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295366-d2272727-Reviews-La_Cuevita_de_Urquizu-Antigua_Sacatepequez_Department.html,"Antigua, Guatemala",restaurants,3.0,4.0
A great spot for lunch,"A lovely little café and bakery. I love cinnamon so a café with that name beckoned to me. It was very pleasant sitting in the courtyard, looking at the flowers and listening to the water flowing in the fountain while having lunch. The avocado toast with egg and the vegetarian panini were both very good. We also succumbed and had dessert. Worth every calorie. The service was excellent and allowed me to practice my Spanish, yet spoke perfect English.

Deserves to be a success,"Recently opened, this restaurant deserves a visit. The menu is extensive and includes culinary influences reflective of Persian history. The baba ganoush was amazing and the accompanying naan was warm, soft and delicious. The vegetable kabob was grilled to perfection. The lamb kabob was tasty. A Persian stew with chicken in a pomegranate sauce with walnuts and spices was tangy and sweet. The accompanying saffron rice was very good. The only regret was not being able to try some of the other menu items. Vegetarian and vegan options were available. Service was great and the waiter was very knowledgeable.

Our favourite hotel in Greece,"This hotel and associated restaurant deserve the highest ratings. The place is lovely, great rooms, a terrific pool large enough for decent lap swimming, a great restaurant and perhaps most important, amazing staff. And of course very close to several great beaches for sunning, swimming or a long walk along the beaches or through the cedar forest. About 25 Km South of Hora (Naxos Town), it is peaceful, not crowded, yet has easy access to everything you would want and for touring the island. We spent our days walking, swimming, sunning and/or visiting Hora, touring the countryside and visiting villages and historic sites and then returning to have a wonderful meal in their restaurant. Pickups from the airport or sea port can be arranged. Highly recommended for those that want all that Naxos has to offer, while avoiding the busier nature of staying in Hora. Can’t wait to go back.",October 2018,Faros Villa Small Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189431-d644697-Reviews-Faros_Villa_Small_Hotel-Naxos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Naxos, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Expensive but convenient,"Nice hotel, surprisingly quiet given the proximity to the airport. The service was good, rooms decent, excellent bathrooms with one of the best shower/tub combinations. Staff were helpful and the restaurant food was quite good. An issue for us was the restriction to the number of devices per room for WiFi access. Given we both have smart phones and tablets, allowing only 3 devices to access the internet required some planning. The indoor pool was too small for lap swimming.",October 2018,Sofitel Athens Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562627-d285733-Reviews-Sofitel_Athens_Airport-Spata_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Spata, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great lunch - worth the walk from Oia,"Located in Finikia, it is a 10 to 15 minute walk from Oia, but definitely worth it. The view is of the sea on the North coast of the island. Not as spectacular as the caldera views, but sitting on the roof top away from the crowds was terrific. We were there for lunch and had the best eggplant I have ever tasted. We also shared the special salad ( not the typical Greek salad ) and really enjoyed it.

Good lunch and dinner,"We were staying in Finikia so decided to try all three restaurants here. We had lunch and dinner here and enjoyed both meals. The service was good both times. We had the eggplant salad, saganaki and Greek salad for lunch. My wife thought it was the best eggplant salad and bread on our trip ( I liked the eggplant salad at Meze Meze better ). For the dinner we tried the kokonisto ( beef stew ) and the Greek version of spaghetti bolognese. Both were great. The seasoning in the bolognese was particularly good. Of course there is a scrumptious dessert ( on the house ). If you are staying in Oia, it is certainly worth the short walk away from the hordes there. Because it is an old Greek village with a maze of small paths, watch for the signs.",September 2018,Krinaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g10521928-d1812490-Reviews-Krinaki-Finikia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great dinner - reserve if possible,"We went for dinner at 7:45 p.m. and we got one of the last tables available without a reservation. The food was amazing and the staff were great. The waiters were busy and rushing everywhere, but we never felt rushed or pushed at any time. We had the stuffed eggplant and lamb chops. Both were absolutely delicious. As usual at many Crete restaurants we were given a delicious custard dessert and Raki on the house.

"Great place for lunch or early dinner - casual, family atmosphere","This restaurant was recommended by our hotel across the street and it was very good. It is only open during the day, closing at 8 p.m. They have daily specials in addition to standard menu items. Two of us shared a seasonal salad and a pumpkin pie ( the savoury kind, not the sweet dessert). Both were excellent and the portions were quite large. The staff were very helpful, encouraging us to view the open kitchen and explaining the menu. It is very busy, but turnover is fairly good.

"A good choice away from the craziness of downtown, but close enough to enjoy all the sites","We stayed for a few nights at the start of our trip and for one night after a tour of the mainland. Listed as a 5 star, at first I thought it didn’t deserve the ranking. Then we stayed at some 4 star hotels after and I revised my internal ranking and boosted it up a notch. The room was fine, great bathroom, lots of space and importantly, quiet at night. The WiFi wasn’t the best, but certainly adequate. The roof top pool was great. Not huge, but still good for some laps. Drinks at the pool side bar were two to three times the price compared to the restaurants virtually next door. We really liked the location. Away from the noise and bustle from the city centre, yet easily accessible to all the main sites. Situated on Caravel Square, there were lots of restaurants near by. We walked to the centre a couple of times, but when we were tired the taxis were very reasonable. Usually 5 Euros. The staff were great. Attentive, friendly and helpful. All in all, I would recommend this hotel.",September 2018,Divani Caravel Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d230392-Reviews-Divani_Caravel_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Great view, food average","Loved the view, sitting on the cliff side overlooking the bay, full moon rising. That part was definitely worth it. My sea bass was fairly good and I liked the tomato/caper salad that was an accompaniment. My wife’s shrimp were over cooked and tasteless. The Cretan wine was nice. A small glass of Raki and a cheesecake (on the house) completed our meal. The staff were very pleasant.",September 2018,SCALA Fish Bar Restaurant & Hotel Boutique,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g656572-d1803989-Reviews-SCALA_Fish_Bar_Restaurant_Hotel_Boutique-Matala_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Best lunch on our trip,"We stumbled upon this place when driving around the area surrounding Anogia. We had just seen the Sfendoni Caves in Zoniana and decided to go to Axos to see what was there. We spotted the restaurant higher up the mountain and thought the view would be worth the visit. Best decision in a long time. The lunch was simply amazing. We shared the Oaxis salad ( lettuce, grilled pork, dried figs amongst other ingredients and a terrific dressing ) which came in an edible bowl of sesame seeds, slivered almonds and honey. We also shared what we thought would be a plate of bread and meats, but turned out to be like a pizza on a flat bread. Also delicious. The portions were quite large. The service was excellent, staff extremely friendly.

A hotel full of tour buses,"A decent enough hotel, not sure if 3 or 4 star. On the outskirts of the village, but easily walkable in 5 to10 minutes. The village is cute and has tremendous views of the valley if you have time. Breakfasts and dinner are the typical buffet style with all the same menu items. Lots of choice, but average.

Great choice on Caravel Square,"We were in Athens for five days and ate here twice. Chose it the first time due to the proximity of our hotel. Went the second time because the food was decent and the staff exceptional. The staff were always warm, cheerful, friendly and attentive. There are lots of restaurants on the square and this one is certainly worth a try. Many choose to sit inside but we preferred the tables across the narrow street nestled under the trees in the square. Very pleasant, even when the sun is beating down. As others have commented, we ordered only drinks and the main course and we received complementary soup and dessert. In essence they were probably included in determining the cost per dish, but still was nice to have. The moussaka was terrific. We also had the beef ribs one night and the roasted lamb the other night. Both were good, not exceptional but good. Less then 50 Euros for two people each night.

The West African Peanut Stew and the Vegan Meatloaf (an oxymoron?) were both considered to be excellent by our table mates. The dessert was the only disappointment. Overall a great choice.",July 2018,Boffins Public House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155043-d774256-Reviews-Boffins_Public_House-Saskatoon_Saskatchewan.html,"Saskatoon, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Great spot for lunch, coffee, light dinner","Very good salads and paninis. Our party of four had the spicy chicken panini, Greek feta panini and the salad with strawberries, nuts topped with grilled chicken. All were extremely tasty. Has a Lovely back patio. Lots of choices of coffee, teas, cold drinks, beers.

"Service good, limonada good, tacos not so good","A great location close to the centre. We went for a late lunch/early dinner as we had a walking tour organized for the early evening. The staff were pleasant and got added points for letting me use my limited Spanish. The limonadas could be ordered with or without sugar and both were good. The tacos were a huge disappointment. We had the barbacoa fish tacos and the al mojo fish tacos. The al mojo were so loaded with garlic that they were not edible. The barbacoa tacos were over cooked and dry. The salsas didn’t add anything but heat. Perhaps this was a one off experience, but there are so many good restaurants in all price ranges in San Miguel that at this time I can not recommend this one.",March 2018,La Sirena Gorda,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g151932-d3708479-Reviews-La_Sirena_Gorda-San_Miguel_de_Allende_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html,"San Miguel de Allende, Mexico",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Enjoyed our lunch tremendously,"Such a pleasant surprise. We were on a day trip to Querétaro and our guide suggested we stop here for lunch. The day was sunny and hot, but under the umbrellas it was very pleasant. The service was outstanding. As others have mentioned the menu is eclectic. My wife and I shared a cheese board and a salad. The cheese board had five different types of cheeses, Serrano ham and fruit. The salad had arugula, spinach, carmelized nuts, grilled asparagus and goat cheese. Both were wonderful. Accompanied by locally brewed cervezas and mineral water, we couldn’t have asked for a better place to sit, eat, drink and enjoy the lovely plaza.",March 2018,Restaurante Bar 1810,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g479232-d1170735-Reviews-Restaurante_Bar_1810-Queretaro_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html,"Queretaro City, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Best place for coffee, pastries, limonada or sandwiches in San Miguel","The pastries are tremendous, the coffees excellent and the limonada is made on the spot with or without sugar or as requested.

The best cooking class ever.,"The title says it all ‘ The best cooking class ever ‘. Great market tour, great food, great fun, great conversation. Paco is knowledgeable, personable and an incredible chef. We have been fortunate to have been on market tours in many countries and although this market was not the largest, without a doubt it was the most enjoyable tour we have had. Paco’s love of the food and the people came through in every encounter. We made tamales, empanadas, pozole and a chocolate/tequila desert that all six of us said was the best Mexican food we have ever tasted and perhaps the best meal ever. I wish there was the ability to give six stars.

This a real find,"In a slightly hidden courtyard near the corner of Zacateros and Canal, this pleasant coffee shop/restaurant is one of our favourite places in San Miguel. Close to the central plaza (El Jardin), but sheltered from the noise. We stopped in for almuerzo (early lunch) and really enjoyed the food, service and ambiance. We shared the fruit plate and the tostadas de hummus. Both were excellent as was the café con leche. We will definitely return.",March 2018,La Sacristia Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g151932-d12902855-Reviews-La_Sacristia_Cafe-San_Miguel_de_Allende_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html,"San Miguel de Allende, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great food, great service","The bar was packed, but the restaurant had a couple of tables available on a Friday night. The service was just right, attentive not overbearing. My wife had a stacked vegetarian and cheese tortilla that she loved. I ordered the pork tenderloin with blackberry sauce. Perfectly cooked to my specifications and delicious, flavourful, but not sweet. Surprisingly, it was the whole tenderloin. The side of green beans with almonds was also perfectly cooked and also delicious. All in all, one of the best meals I’ve had recently.",March 2018,Hank's New Orleans Cafe & Oyster Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g151932-d1032337-Reviews-Hank_s_New_Orleans_Cafe_Oyster_Bar-San_Miguel_de_Allende_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_.html,"San Miguel de Allende, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Worth a return visit or two,"As everyone indicates, eat on the roof top terrace. Great food, good selection of beverages. The fish tacos are terrific. We had tilapia, spicy shrimp and marlin tacos. All were delicious. Will try some of the other dishes on our next visit. This has a casual, welcoming atmosphere. So nice after walking through the busy central plaza.",March 2018,Baja Fish Taquito,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g151932-d6405478-Reviews-Baja_Fish_Taquito-San_Miguel_de_Allende_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html,"San Miguel de Allende, Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Will have to change my ranking scale - this restaurant is the best, others will go down a notch.","The best tapas ever. Nice decor, great ambience, friendly and efficient staff and great food. Recommended by a close friend who lived in Spain until recently. Easy to get to by metro (near Bilbao stop). Not your typical tourist tapas. Much, much better. We had quekas (like a quesadilla), humus made from edamame and tofu on top of homemade crackers, camarones in a curry sauce and a house favourite of baozi de cebón. Then dessert was amazing. A cheese cake and an apple crumble with cinnamon ice cream. A bonus because you can reserve on line.

Great choice on a street filled with restaurants,"We went on a Friday evening at 8:30 and were lucky to find a table. Shortly after this it was full. The menu is not a type tapas menu, it has some familiar items such as patatas bravas. We tried the avocado and palm hearts salad, the mexican burrito abs the cachapas (corn pancakes with fillings).

Had lunch twice here and loved it,"We stumbled on this place when roaming near the Palacio Real and the cathedral. About a block North of Calle mayor, it is nestled in a tiny plaza (Biombo) away from the tourist hustle and bustle so you can talk, yet so close to these important sights. The food is good and the service excellent. Highly recommended.

A must see - look for automated ticket machines,"This is truly an amazing place. Go see it. It has all been said, so I will just add my suggestion regarding the tickets. When we arrived, I noticed a long line at the ticket booth, but if you glance to the left of the booth there are two small automatic ticket machines. A short line up, fast and easy.

"Great food, great service","Nestled in a courtyard, this restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere. The food and service are both excellent. The salads are great and if you order the full size, it is more than enough for 2 to 3 people. The salmorejo and the beef sirloin strip are also wonderful.

"Great room, great staff, spectacular view","We loved it. We had a junior suite which was spacious and had an enormous bed, chesterfield, chairs, an ottoman, dresser, a large closet (lots of hangers) and a safe to name some of the amenities. The bathroom was also large with good lighting and a large shower encased on three sides in marble. On top of this, the view was amazing. The staff was also great: friendly and extremely helpful.

Great tapas with a difference,"It was suggested by two different staff members at our hotel as a place that both locals and tourists go. The food was amazing. The cod with parsley sauce and the grilled vegetables tapas were both outstanding. We arrived a short time after opening, which is 8:30 and got one of the last tables inside ( it was a cool night, so the outside tables were left to more hardy folk ). It quickly filled with a wide range of people including four young families with babies and strollers. A fun time with lots of conversation, great food and wine.

"Good food on the street or in a quiet, cool courtyard","This taberna has tables outside, inside the bar area and up a few steps into an interior courtyard. Depending upon your mood and the temperature outside, this bar/restaurant has great options. The menu has many Andalusian and North African items. The chicken kabobs are very good, the chicken with plums and almonds is great, the humus is fabulous . The service is great (many languages spoken) and you can reserve on-line. The best part is that you can avoid the crowds in the Cathedral and main plaza areas.

"Spectacular, but plan your visit ahead of time","An amazing place to tour and definitely worth the time. We were there mid-October and the line up to get in without a pre-purchased ticket was huge. Go early morning and line up before it opens ( and you will be in the shade ) or very late in the afternoon. There are actually 3 lines: one for on-line tickets, one for groups and one for those of us who did not remember to pre-book. At times it is hard to know which is which. Regardless, don’t miss this.
