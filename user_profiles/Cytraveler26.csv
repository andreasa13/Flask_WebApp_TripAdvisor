The food was served promptly and was very tasty and the prices were very reasonable. The quality of the ingredients was excellent. The best part was it was not full of loud tourists so you could have a nice conversation. My wife and I each had pasta and both were very good. There is an open kitchen so one can watch the meals being prepared. I highly recommend this for a nice diversion from Greek Food.",November 2019,Belpaese,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3323606-Reviews-Belpaese-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
