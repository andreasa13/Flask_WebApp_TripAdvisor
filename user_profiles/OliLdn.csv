"Fun evening, great food!","We booked via the fork and were pleasantly surprised by this traditional restaurant located in the old town.

Authentic Madeiran food experience,"Our hotel recommended us this restaurant for dinner, located next to the Mercado dos lavradores.

Fantastic dinner experience!,"We booked via the fork and were happily surprised with everything Principal Bistro has to offer! From the service to the food, the whole experience was fabulous!!
The restaurant and its terrace are very well appointed and the service is impeccable. The food was nothing short of a Michelin star, I had the best seared foie gras ever, cooked to perfection! The whole meal was simply delicious and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Madeira, just fantastic!

Lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Funchal!,"The location was great, on a quiet side street in the heart of town, walking distance to all the restaurants, with parking facilities available just outside the hotel for 6 Euros a day.

Our room had a nice balcony overlooking Funchal and its hills, comfy bed, power shower, couldn't fault it.

We stayed for 7 nights and what made it special for us was the team. Everyone we dealt with (from reception, housekeeping to the breakfast ladies) were just super friendly and genuinely nice!

Special thanks to Marcelo and Tania who did a superb job at making us feel welcome and at home, super informative, nothing was too much trouble and we really appreciated all your efforts during our stay, thank you so much!",October 2020,Hotel do Carmo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189167-d254086-Reviews-Hotel_do_Carmo-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,"Madeira, Portugal",hotels,5.0,4.0
Fab Italian restaurant in the heart of Soho,"What a nice surprise in the heart of Soho! We had a delicious meal on a cold Friday night, the service was impeccable and the food really fresh and tasty! The Vermouth bar was fun, we discovered a few new ones before dining. Despite the street level bar being empty, there was a nice ambiance in the restaurant downstairs which was nearly at capacity.

"Hell in 'super paradise', avoid at all costs!!!","Overrated and overpriced, badly managed staff with a lot of attitude.

With such rates one would expect a posh club where clients are treated like royalties... Quite the opposite sadly, they never apologised nor expressed any form of empathy for ruining my 40th birthday!

Five of us spent the last full day of our 2 weeks holiday there in the hope to spend a relaxing day in beautiful surroundings. Unfortunately, soon after our arrival, we realised it was going to be a journey to hell!

First, they tried to overcharge us for sunbeds (235€ in total!), all sunbeds were in the shade by 3pm,no comment. Instead of having a 3 course birthday lunch in the restaurant (I did book a table) we were forced to eat mediocre food on our laps by the sunbeds as they wouldn’t let 5 of us eat at the same table in the restaurant!
We never had a problem finding a table for 5 in over 2 weeks, but they claimed they were only following COVID government guidelines, really? A third of your staff didn't even wear face masks when talking to us, get a reality check please.

The rounds of drinks weren’t cheap at 25€ a cocktail, plus if you wish to see the Drag Show there is a minimum spend of 50€ per person, even if you’ve already spent 100s of Euros at the Club all day long, what a joke!

We witnessed dodgy deals in the toilets, male escorts by the pool, other unhappy customers complaining to a so called ‘store manager’ who has no clue about customer service, that's Jackie O for you in a nutshell!

Extremely poor management response, instead of easing the situation they stood for nearly 30min by our sunbeds, arguing in Greek with my friend, causing a scene, a total disgrace! It put us off our food and ruined the whole day for us. We ended up leaving before the show as we couldn’t bear being taken for fools any longer. I wanted to treat my friends for my birthday and instead was made to pay 600€ for a horrid experience. Tavernas offer better food and service for a fraction of the price!

I contacted them by email the next day, they refused to give me the details of senior management and stopped communicating with me. I've been chasing that 'store manager'for 3 weeks via email now, I'm giving up!

Tip: try Scorpios or SantAnna instead, much nicer clubs with proper service!

Jackie Oh no, never again!",September 2020,Jackie O' Mykonos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6581364-d4813583-Reviews-Jackie_O_Mykonos-Plintri_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Amazing day in Piraeus,"We spent the day at Pisina, lounging on sunbed, in and out of the pool, sipping cocktails!

Fantastic dinner overlooking the Acropolis!,"So glad my friend recommended this place, a must when in Athens! The food is Greek fine dining, the service was great and most importantly the views of the Acropolis did not disappoint. We got there just before sunset and loved the roof terrace.

"Fantastic location, great beach bars and restaurants!","What a beauty! The place is insane, we absolutely loved it! So many restaurants to choose from, so many bars, a great vibes.

Greek hospitality at its best!,"We stopped by during the day for drinks as we noticed canary birds in separate cages dotted around the terrace, named after Pavarotti, Elton John and the likes, such a nice touch! It was my birthday and Mr Spiros offered us some aperitifs. We had a lunch reservation elsewhere on that day but promised to come back another time. A couple of nights later we went back for dinner and experienced sumptuous Greek food and Greek hospitality at its best! Mr Spiros is certainly the host with the most; while his wife and her team prepare delicious meals in the kitchen, Spiros entertains guests with such authenticity and humour, a true legend! We shared a few Uzos and hope to be back for more soon!

"Fabulous birthday lunch, great service, highly recommend The Ark!","I was travelling the Greek islands for my 40th birthday and stumbled upon The Ark while looking for recommendations on Corfu and its beaches. I contacted the restaurant via Facebook to reserve a table and they immediately offered to make a birthday cake for me which was really sweet. On the day, the service was impeccable, we had a 3 hour lunch (great cocktails, delicious food and a fantastic birthday cake indeed) followed by some relaxing time on the beach before watching the sun set from the terrace. An amazing experience, made all the more special by Yorgos and the fabulous team who looked after us so well all day long!

Fabulous day out!,"This day was just amazing, one of the highlights of my trip to Thailand. I was picked up from my hotel and an hour later or so, after driving through the jungle, arrived at Camp 6 where the whole team made us feel so welcome. There were 8 females and 1 baby elephant (male), Lufy, the star of the show! The elephants are so well cared, free to roam, go as they please. After feeding them bananas and bamboo shoots, we pampered them, gave them a mud bath and went into the nearby riverbed with them before having a delicious meal overlooking the valley. It was magical, thank you so much for such a great, lots of fond memories!!",February 2020,Chiang Mai Elephant Sanctuary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293917-d8638599-Reviews-Chiang_Mai_Elephant_Sanctuary-Chiang_Mai.html,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.0
Amazing boutique hotel experience in the heart of Bangkok,"The hotel is simply fabulous! I stayed for 3 nights and made the most of Bangkok as it is so conveniently located. The public areas are outstanding, the pools (there are two!!) are really clean and inviting, the restaurant serves delicious authentic food! The bedroom was super comfortable and spacious, the bathroom really posh - 5 star European standards in the middle of Asia, couldn't fault it! Breakfast was served in the garden each morning, yummy buffet and great egg station! I felt so lucky to stay at the Rose Residence, the team are very friendly and spoke good English. As I was travelling on my own, they did everything they could to make me feel at home, they arranged taxis for me, give me recommendations etc. True Thai hospitality at its best, I'll be back!!",February 2020,The Rose Residence,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293916-d14933462-Reviews-The_Rose_Residence-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",hotels,5.0,5.0
