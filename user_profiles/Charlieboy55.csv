A bar with connections with James Joyce,"When James Joyce left Ireland with Nora Barnacle in 1904, he looked for work teaching English with the Berlitz schools in Zürich and Trieste. However, the organization found work for him in Pula instead. Although paid only £2 for a sixteen-hour week, Joyce and Nora enjoyed this first taste of domestic life, though Joyce did not care for Pula and regarded it as a provincial backwater. He left at the first opportunity and accepted a job in Trieste just six months later.

Joyce spent most of his time in Pula writing much of what subsequently became 'Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'. The city made little impact on his literary imagination.

The café-bar Uliks ('Ulysses' in Croatian) is on the ground floor of the apartment block that previously housed the Berlitz language school. The terrace has a bronze sculpture of the artist sitting on a chair; there is a plaque on the wall and inside there is a small glass cabinet that contains Joyce memorabilia.",May 2019,Caffe Uliks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295373-d9587465-Reviews-Caffe_Uliks-Pula_Istria.html,"Pula, Croatia",attractions,4.0,4.0
A pleasant retreat from noise and bustle,"As I live quite close to Farmleigh, I regularly walk around the grounds during the morning. It has a small lake, where you can feed the ducks from a café by the water's edge, a walled garden (which latterly has been in poor shape), an ornamental garden and a fine long avenue lined by tall trees. The place is especially magical in spring and autumn.

The house, which is very average by Irish 'big house' standards, is worth a visit. Some years ago, the public was allowed to enter by the hall door and wander around. This was stopped and free organised tours were started. From this year, the tours have to be paid for - €8 for an adult. Although the house is large, only very few of the rooms are open to the public. There is a fine ballroom, where concerts are held from time to time. The conservatory, which is beside the ballroom, has been restored recently.

Overall, a fine place to visit, though the grounds are not in such good condtion as they used to be some years ago.",October 2019,Farmleigh House and Estate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d2467386-Reviews-Farmleigh_House_and_Estate-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,4.0,4.5
Expensive dinner dishes but a convenient place to dine,"Although I had been warned about the price and poor quality of the food in The Terrace restaurant, a friend and I dined there before a concert recently. I was glad that I had booked a table in advance, as it was quite packed when we arrived. My chicken dish (a generous helping of chicken breast with sauce and very small helpings of potato and vegetables) cost about €20 - and I needed a slice of bread to accompany the meal. It was tasty, but could have been better for the price.",October 2019,The Terrace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186605-d1379459-Reviews-The_Terrace-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Dublin's best concert hall,"I have had the pleasure of being at many fine concerts in Dublin's National Concert Hall. This year I attended a wonderful production of Bach's Saint Matthew Passion in April, the Verdi Requiem a month later and, just recently, a powerful performance of Mahler's mighty Third Symphony. For all these concerts, the hall was packed to full capacity. My only criticism was that there were no words with translation printed in the programmes for the Bach concert, an omission that irked many who had paid €5 for the booklet; I was told that many people demanded their money back and received it. However, words and their translation did appear in the programmes for the Mahler symphony.

Before the Mahler concert, a friend and I dined in the NCH restaurant - despite the fact that I had been warned about the food being overpriced and not particularly good. I was glad that I had booked a table in advance, for the restaurant was packed. The food was expensive (about €22 for one main dish) but attractively presented. Nevertheless, my chicken dish consisted of a generous helping of chicken breast and very little else - I was glad of a spare slice of bread to go with it. Otherwise, it was a pleasant experience.",October 2019,The National Concert Hall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d1531869-Reviews-The_National_Concert_Hall-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
A must-see,"Although the Treasury is a short distance from the main archaeological site of Mycenae, it is worth taking the time to visit it and marvel at the enormous blocks of stone that were used to construct this beehive-shaped building - without the use of modern machinery. It is believed that earthen ramps of increasing height were preprared around the structure and the large stone blocks slid into place all the way to the top. When finished, the ramps were turned into the hill that you can now see.",September 2019,Citadel and Treasury of Atreus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189486-d243267-Reviews-Citadel_and_Treasury_of_Atreus-Mycenae_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Mycenae, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Well worth visiting,"Although probably the best of the finds at Mycenae are to be seen in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, this small museum has an impressive collection of Mycenaean artefacts. Our visit was a little rushed, owing to the fact that we were on an organised tour, but I made sure to take plenty of photographs (without flash). The so-called gold mask of Agamemnon is a copy of the original, which can be seen in the museum in Athens.

A palatial restaurant with excellent food,"Our tour bus stopped at this palatial building at lunchtime, after we had visited nearby Mycenae, and we made our way to the cool and spacious interior. The service was quick; as I was hot and not particularly hungry, I just ordered the Kolizeras salad and a glass of their fresh orange juice. One of the waiters quickly appeared with a basket of bread. Delicious. Later one of my companions offered me a glass of wine, as he had ordered too much. Very comfortable - and the toilets were very modern and clean.",September 2019,Kolizeras Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189486-d6623646-Reviews-Kolizeras_Restaurant-Mycenae_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Mycenae, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Terrific views,"Our guided tour stopped in Nafplio for a couple of hours on our last day of the holiday. While many of my companions ambled around the pretty streets or sat outside a café with a cool drink, I headed up the steps with my camera to the Akronafplia Fortrtess. Although I did not have enough time to go into the fortress, I was able to take some terrific shots looking down over the old town towards the bay and, from the other side, towards the fortification on top of an adjoining mountain - very impressive. I wished that I had more time to explore the town, with its interesting examples of Venetian architecture here and there.",September 2019,Akronafplia Fortress,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g319780-d4454397-Reviews-Akronafplia_Fortress-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
A wonderful experience,"Having seen photographs of this famous archaeological site, I was very interested to visit it, mainly because of its age and importance. Dating from the Bronze Age (c. 1600 - 1200 BC), Mycenae was the capital of an empire of city-states. After the Mycenaeans attacked Troy in Asia Minor, they became undisputed rulers of the Aegean region. They then mysteriously disappeared and their capital was abandoned. What now remains of it is in ruins, but one can still imagine how imposing it must have been.

We were first taken to the amazing Treasury of Atreus. Although there is nothing to see inside this mighty 'tholos' or beehive-shaped funeral chamber, the sheer size of the building and the huge stones used to construct it are a wonder to behold: the lintel over the doorway is enormous and weighs 120 tons.

The famous Lion Gate forms the entrance to the city on the acropolis or hill. This too was constructed using huge stones. Just to the right after the gate is Grave Circle A, where members of the royalty were buried in shaft graves. These were excavated in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann, who discovered a rich find of precious belongings, including the so-called gold mask of Agamemnon (a copy of which can be seen in the nearby museum). A slippery climb brings you up to the ruins of the Royal Palace and Throne Room, from where there is a fine view.

The museum by the hill is also worth visiting. Highly recommended; miss this and you've missed one of the great historical sites of Greece.",September 2019,Archaeological Site Mycenae,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189486-d522565-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_Mycenae-Mycenae_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Mycenae, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A thrilling experience,"We were taken to the Great Theatre of Epidaurus (or Epidavros) as part of an organised tour. This wonderful sight is the finest and best-preserved theatre in Greece, and it is noted for its excellent acoustics. From the top I could clearly hear conversations down around the orchestra (the circular part of the stage). When I got a chance, I went down, stood in the middle of the orchestra and declaimed some poetry that I had learned in school. The effect was astonishing - I could hear my voice coming back to me like an echo. Afterwards, I rejoined the group and we were brought into the museum for a quick tour. Thoroughly recommended.",September 2019,The Great Theatre of Epidaurus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g815573-d198893-Reviews-The_Great_Theatre_of_Epidaurus-Epidavros_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Epidavros, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
A good place for a relaxing lunch,"A companion and I had a simple lunch in this restaurant, sitting outdoors and overlooking the deep blue sea. I just ate a Greek salad, with some bread, and we shared a small carafe of rosé wine. Afterwards we used the toilet, which wasn't exactly very clean. We noticed the presence of quite a number of locals, who had obviously come for their Sunday lunch - usually a good sign. As far as I remember, the price was quite reasonable.",September 2019,Mpoumpoulina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2699968-d1477950-Reviews-Mpoumpoulina-Spetses_Town_Spetses_Saronic_Gulf_Islands_Attica.html,"Spetses, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
A rapid tour of an interesting house,"We were brought to the island of Spetses as part of an organised tour, travelling there by water taxi, and our guide recommended visiting Bouboulina's Museum, which was just a minute's walk from the port. One of my companions and I availed of the concession rate for retired people and so the ticket only cost €4. Inside, we were given copies of a description, in English, which we were allowed to read but not keep. We read this while a young man gave a verbose description to a group of locals in very rapid Greek.

An English guide then conducted us inside the fine old house and described it to us in a similar rapid manner. Once we were finished in one room, we were ushered into the next - managing to avoid clashing with the Greek-speaking group. The house was not very extraordinary and there were only four rooms to visit, but it was quite interesting - it was an opportunity to see the inside of an upper-class house. The story of Bouboulina was certainly quite extraordinary.

The short tour ended abruptly, we were shown the door and the guide scampered off to deal with the next group of people. We concluded that the people who run this small museum should allocate a little more time to visits, which are really rather rushed.",September 2019,Bouboulina's Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189496-d1822757-Reviews-Bouboulina_s_Museum-Spetses_Saronic_Gulf_Islands_Attica.html,"Spetses, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
A wonderful experience,"My visit to this unique Byzantine town (mostly in ruins) was with an organised tour group. Because of the nature of organised tours, our time was limited and we saw relatively little, but what we saw was extremely interesting and our appreciation of the buildings was intensified by the expert explanations given by our excellent guide. The two main sights we visited were the small Saint Kyriaki chapel, with its wonderful frescoes, and the Convent and Church of Pantanassa, a relatively easy climb upwards from the chapel.

Although crude by modern standards, the frescoes in the Saint Kyriaki are vivid and depict scenes from the New Testament. The Church of Pantanassa is a more conventional Greek Orthodox church, which also has fine frescoes. The convent area outside is very pretty and, when we were there, was alive with cats - including a tiny marmalade-coloured kitten. Our guide spoke to one of the elderly nuns, who admitted us to a room and offered us sweets. For sale here were examples of the nuns' embroidery work, some of which was very fine. Although I would not describe myself as a religiious person, I was delighted to purchase one of these handmade works, as I was deeply moved by the experience of visiting this special place and the nun's gratefulness and warm handshake when I paid her the money. I will treasure the memory of this excursion - it was really something special.

Highly recommended; spend as much time as you can here and follow the suggestions of other travellers regarding sensible footwear.",September 2019,Mystras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189489-d320200-Reviews-Mystras-Sparta_Sparta_Municipality_Laconia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Sparta, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A pleasant stay,"Like a previous reviewer, I was a member of a Travel Department tour and stayed in a similar room close to the car park. I made sure to keep the window tightly closed at night and I avoided the bar beside the swimming pool in the evening as nearly everyone got mosquito bites. Fortunately we did not have eighty Dutch teenagers taking over the restaurant. The breakfasts were good and the dinners in the evening were eatable but unexciting.

Worth seeing - but not worth going to see,It was miserably wet when our tour bus stopped briefly so that we could see what little remained of Ancient Corinth: just a few columns and lots of stones scattered about a couple of fields.

Good food at a good price,"Having stopped to view the Corinth Canal, we were driven to the large To Perama restaurant, which caters for large tourist groups.

A comfortable stay,"I stayed for three nights at this fine hotel, situated in a rather grubby and noisy street. Although at some distance from the historical centre of Athens, it was a comfortable twenty-minute walk away from the National Archaeological Museum - a big plus in my estimation. The room was pleasant, the staff friendly and the buffet breakfasts were excellent. The rooftop restaurant was a nice place to relax in during the evenings. My only quibble was the WiFi signal, which was very weak in my room on the sixth floor - it was better in the corridor. On my first evening, I had to go down to the lobby to avail of a stronger signal.

Exquisite,"I walked a considerable distance to get to the Benaki Museum; when I arrived I discovered that I was too early - the museum opens at 10 a.m. A few other people had made the same mistake. Once inside this beautiful Neoclassical building, I knew that I was in for a treat. Established in 1930 by Antonis Benakis, this private collection houses some real gems from different periods of Greek history. Not only are there exquisite ancient artefacts, but there are also fascinating examples of early Christian art and lesser-known aspects of Greek culture. As you progress through the rooms, you go forward in time; there are examples of Byzantine and Ottoman art, local costumes, traditional domestic rooms, paintings of a later period... the collection is quite mind boggling. My only quibble is that the numbering of some of the rooms was rather confusing. Give yourself plenty of time to see this worthwhile collection. There is a classy rooftop café where you can relax, and a fine gift shop.",September 2019,Benaki Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198714-Reviews-Benaki_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A dream come true,"I went on an organised trip to Delphi - a place that I had long wished to see. Precariously perched on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, this ancient and sacred site affords breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside and mountains. We arrived mid-morning and slowly ascended, stopping to view the various ruined buildings and listen to our guide's explanations. Passing the Roman Forum, with its row of shops, we made our way to the Treasury of the Athenians, a small but important building architecturally speaking. The great Temple of Apollo, in which the oracle delivered her prophecies, is higher and only its six great Doric columns and the base now mark the spot. From here you can see the great and well-preserved theatre; climb up to the area above the theatre for the best view looking downwards. If you still have energy, continue upwards until you reach the fine stadium, where the Pythian Games were once held. The admission ticket entitles you to visit the museum, which is well worth seeing. However, as the rooms are small, it can become rather crowded.

Built in the 19th century, it is dimly lit inside but very atmospheric. Weary after so much walking during the heat of the day, it was delightful to sit here for a while and contemplate the frescoes, icons and general décor.

A rushed tour of the Agora,"According to Rick Steves' guide, 'Greece: Athens & the Peloponese', the Ancient Agora would be open until 8 p.m. However, when I arrived at 6.30 p.m., I discovered that it was due to close at 7 p.m. Nevertheless, as I was in the area and was not planning to return to it, I paid for a ticket and, once I had got my bearings, headed for the impressive restored Stoa of Attalos. When I entered the small museum, the ladies in charge informed me and some visitors that it would close in ten minutes' time. To emphasise the point, they began to turn off the lights as I took a hurried look at the exhibits. The ancient artefacts looked interesting, but I was only allowed a few minutes to examine them. Outside again, I picked my way across the site by the Middle Stoa and walked towards the Temple of Hephaistos. Just as I approached it, a man began to ring a bell and shout that everyone should make their way to the exit. When I tried to take a photo of the elegant temple, the battery in my camera suddenly gave out. However, I took a good look at the temple, which is in remarkably good condition, and gradually did make my way to the exit, having seen little or nothing of the rest of the site. Annoyed by the brusque treatment by the staff, I told the lady at the gate that my tour had been very rushed but unsurprisingly she made no apology. I left well before seven o'clock.

A wonderful experience,"I visited the Acropolis as part of an organised tour and was puzzled as to why we were brought there at around midday, when the temperature was at its hottest. The explanation was simple: people were leaving and there was no queue at the entrance gate. We entered without any delay and began the climb to the top of the hill. Although in ruins, I was thrilled to see these famous temples at long last. When our excellent guide had finished her description of the site, I stayed on and explored the rest of the ruins on my own.

A wonderful experience,"Having visited the Acropolis, it made perfect sense to visit this highly original and wonderful museum. The large windows admit plenty of light and offer a most spectacular view of the nearby Acropolis. I started with the restaurant, where I had a light lunch and enjoyed the view. I then applied myself to the exhibits. Although they are very interesting, you do have to use your imagination as most of them are damaged in some way; for example, many of the statues have broken arms or no heads. On the top floor, the frieze and surviving metopes of the Parthenon are displayed as they would appear on the temple outside. Screens dotted around the exhibition halls depict items as they would appear if restored, and show the colours as they would have appeared when newly painted.

Astonishing,"Having read all about this important museum, I visited it at around 4 p.m., soon after arriving in Athens, and left when it closed shortly before 8 p.m. Using Rick Steves' excellent guidebook ('Greece: Athens & the Peloponnese'), I began with the earliest exhibits: the Cycladic figurines, dating from around 2500 BC. Although quite fascinating, the gold masks and decorative items of the Mycenaean era (1600-1200 BC) really took my breath away. Having examined these wonderful exhibits in the central rooms of the ground floor, I then applied myself to the statuary, starting with the typically stiff Archaic 'kouroi' and 'korai' (naked men and modestly clothed women). These gradually gave way to more naturalistic statues such as the astonishingly realistic Artemision Bronze. At the far end of the ground floor were beautiful, yet heart-rending funeral steles: carved depictions of deceased people bidding farewell to their loved ones, which would have been placed over graves. Also on display in this area was the Artemision Jockey: a bronze statue of a young jockey astride a galloping horse. The rest of the statuary, displayed on the other side of the museum, was incredibly realistic; this collection comprised Greek originals and Roman copies. There are more rooms upstairs, where you can see wall paintings and artefacts discovered in the ancient settlement of Akrotiri on the island of Santorini. Also there are a collection of Greek vases and a gallery containing Egyptian artefacts.

At the end of my tour, I staggered out and had a meal in the restaurant in the grounds of the museum. The food on offer was European rather than Greek, it was a little expensive and the service was rather slow. However, when you're exhausted, anything will do!

Very enjoyable,"On a recent trip to County Down with Friends of the National Gallery of Ireland (in Dublin), we stopped in the F. E. McWilliam Gallery for tea and scones, a look at McWilliam's highly unusual but interesting work and a temporary exhibition of paintings entitled 'The Scottish Colourists'. The scones were delicious; the sculpture garden, sculpture collection and replica of McWilliam's studio-workshop were fascinating; and the paintings (by Scottish artists previously unknown to me) were well worth seeing - even though many of them were painted in the style of better-known continental and world-famous painters.

Overall I was most impressed by the cleanliness of the centre and the helpfulness of the staff. The gentleman who explained the works of art to us was, despite his modesty, very knowledgeable about the paintings and the sculpture. A thoroughly enjoyable visit.",July 2019,F E McWilliam Gallery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g209955-d1489020-Reviews-F_E_McWilliam_Gallery-Banbridge_County_Down_Northern_Ireland.html,"Banbridge, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
A wonderful visit,"I joined a group of Friends from the National Gallery of Ireland and set off last Friday morning by bus to visit the F. E. McWilliam Gallery in Banbridge, County Down and then Hillsborough Castle, where we stopped for lunch in the new restaurant. As the meal was pre-booked, we just had a choice of two hot meals: salmon or chicken. Some members of the group ate very little of the meal, probably because it was such a hot, sunny day, when a salad of some type would have been more welcome. Other reviewers have remarked on this. However, I was most impressed by the cleanliness of the restaurant and the friendliness of the staff.

After the meal we spent some time wandering around the fine walled garden, where we got chatting to one of the gardeners, who proved to be a very interesting person. I learned from him that the walled garden had been restored and the new restaurant opened in April 2019.

While in the walled garden we were accosted by a gentleman in period costume who told us his name, which was very long indeed, and who proceeded to tell us all about himself and various historical facts. We escaped from him as quickly as possible and made our way to the beautiful grounds and gardens that surround the big house. For an excellent description of these, see Tim B's review below.

Our tour of the house began at 4.15 p.m. precisely. There were 23 of us in all and so the rooms did not feel too crowded. Our guide was a young lady who gave us an excellent introduction to the history of the house and its various rooms, which were quite interesting. Although the house is not hugely impressive, it certainly is well worth visiting for its works of art, furniture and history. I was interested to note a fine longcase (or 'grandfather') clock made by the celebrated 17th cent. clockmaker Daniel Quare. My favourite room was the State Drawing Room, where we were allowed to sit on the wonderfully relaxing settees. In it is a fine portrait of Prince Charles by the Belfast-born artist Gareth Reid, which caught my attention.

The tour was perhaps a little rushed, but all in all we were very pleased with it.

Very interesting,"While ambling around the lovely old town centre of Novigrad, we stumbled across the Muzej Lapidarium, where we found a group of people chatting and enjoying coffee and cakes outside in the sunshine. I spoke to a young lady at the door, who apologized for the state of the little museum, which on that day was being used for a conference - inside we could see chairs and tables with notebooks and laptop computers on them. She gave us some literature about the place, brought us in and showed us the exhibition of ancient Roman stonework found in the locality, as well as some photographs and paintings, all of which were quite interesting. On leaving, a young man walked in with a tray full of leftover cakes. When I remarked, 'Mmm - they look tasty!' he said, 'Would you like to try some?' We helped ourselves and he gave us some paper napkins.

Very touristy,"I had read about Motovun and how interesting it was but was rather shocked at how touristy the place was when we arrived: the car, bus and coach park, the shuttle bus service, the shops and restaurants, and the crowds. However, I was glad to discover that by leaving the main square at the top of the hill and taking a narrow, twisty street that led away from the square and down in the opposite direction, I was able to get away from it all and enjoy some delightfully dilapidated rustic architecture and the fine views over the surrounding countryside. This part of the town was quite picturesque and worth visiting. However, I much preferred the hilltop town of Grožnjan, which I had visited with some friends a couple of days beforehand.",May 2019,Hilltop Walled Ancient City of Motovun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303817-d3217281-Reviews-Hilltop_Walled_Ancient_City_of_Motovun-Motovun_Istria.html,"Motovun, Croatia",attractions,3.0,4.5
A very pretty hilltop village,"The village of Grožnjan in inland Istria is well worth visiting and, in my opinion, it is much prettier than the larger and very touristy hilltop village of Motovun further south. The narrow streets are full of charm and there are wonderful views of the rolling countryside from the church and square at the top of the hill. Just before the main gate of the village is a restaurant with outdoor seating, overlooking the countryside, where you can order a simple but tasty meal of local food and drink. To get to Grožnjan you will need to drive or get a taxi. Highly recommended.",May 2019,"Groznjan Hilltop village of artists, Istria, Croatia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303807-d4568497-Reviews-Groznjan_Hilltop_village_of_artists_Istria_Croatia-Groznjan_Istria.html,"Groznjan, Croatia",attractions,5.0,4.5
A most unusual and interesting chapel,"Just outside the tiny village of Beram, east of Pazin in Istria, is a unique chapel known in Croatian as Svetište Sv. Marije na Škriljinah (the Sanctuary of St Mary on the Rocks). It is one of two small churches in Croatia that feature fifteenth-century frescoes depicting various scenes from the Bible. The chapel was featured in a BBC series entitled 'Francesco's Mediterranean Voyage' (2008), in which the Venetian Francesco da Mosto visited it. To get to Beram, you will need to drive or take a taxi. On arrival at the village, it is advisable to ask for the key as the chapel may be locked. A lady will come with you as you will need to drive a short distance to the chapel, which is located in a forest. The building is rather unremarkable from the outside but is quite astonishing inside. You are allowed to take photos, but not allowed to use flash photography. The lady will explain the meaning of the frescoes in a mixture of broken English, German and Italian and will tell you that the roof was restored some years previously. She will draw your attention to a depiction of the Danse Macabre (Dance of Death) painted by Vincent of Kastav on the back wall over the main entrance.

I went to the chapel and nearby Pazin with two friends by taxi, which was organized for us in Poreč; the taxi driver knew where the lady with the key lived.",May 2019,Iglesia de Santa Maria de las Rocas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g13341536-d17599284-Reviews-Iglesia_de_Santa_Maria_de_las_Rocas-Beram_Istria.html,"Beram, Croatia",attractions,5.0,4.5

A pleasant and convenient place to stay,"The Rubin Sunny Hotel is an easy ten- to fifteen-minute walk from/to the old town centre of Poreč, either through a small forest nearby or along the sea front. Although the reception area is large and impressive, the bedrooms are in need of some refurbishment - as other travellers have reported. In my room a reproduction of an Impressionist painting hung crookedly on one of the walls, the telephone was mounted on the wall opposite the bed (not beside it) and the bathroom door was scuffed at the bottom. Nonetheless, both the room and the bed were comfortable and very clean.
The meals in the dining room were, on the whole, excellent, and there was always a terrific selection of food. For tea drinkers, choose the Indian tea bags - this is the nearest they have to standard British or Irish tea. Note that there is no tea- or coffee-making facilities in the bedrooms.
One drawback in this hotel is the lack of lunch either in the dining room or at the bar. Presumably the theory is that, because the weather is always fine, you'll be out and about and within easy reach of a café or restaurant. However, if the weather is unseasonably wet (as it was when I was there) and you're stuck indoors for the day, you won't be able to get anything to eat. The only solution is to defy the rules and smuggle out some food from the restaurant after breakfast. Several of us did this and, thankfully, were not stopped.",May 2019,Rubin Sunny Hotel by Valamar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g303829-d313327-Reviews-Rubin_Sunny_Hotel_by_Valamar-Porec_Istria.html,"Porec, Croatia",hotels,4.0,4.0

Flamenco show of indifferent quality,"While staying in Puerto de la Cruz, I was told of a Flamenco dance performance in the Teatro Timanfaya. Having seen the real thing in Seville, I was rather wary and asked our tour guide for details. She kindly telephoned the theatre and asked if the music was live; she was told yes. She asked if the show was for tourists and was told that it was not; as it was a proper theatre, it was open to everyone, including the locals. Reassured I set off in the evening and bought a ticket for €18, having found the entrance which was temporarily blocked because of repairs to the road leading to it.
I was surprised that the audience was made wait in a rather shabby foyer before being admitted to the small but clean theatre. The show began with a video explaining the art of flamenco, in Spanish, with translations on the screen. At last dancers appeared in a puff of smoke and... prerecorded music was blasted at us over loudspeakers. There were four female dancers, the eldest of which was the best - the others often looked a little unsure of their steps and moves. I guessed that the eldest lady was a teacher. However, the star of the show was the one male dancer, who was a true professional. Instead of the usual accompaniment of guitars, clapping and singing, the music was orchestral and very un-flamenco in style at the beginning. However, as the show progressed, the music and dance became somewhat more authentic.
The worst parts were the live musical intervals that enabled the dancers to rest and change costume. For these a young man ambled on to the stage with a guitar and attempted to play some Spanish music, but his performance was very poor indeed.
The male dancer's excellent performance was enthusiastically applauded but the overall effect was spoiled by his playing to the audience and making them laugh towards the end of the show, which lasted just one hour. Before leaving, we were treated to glass of sangria and savouries.
Although I was reasonably satisfied with the show, I believe that it could have been done so much better. It certainly was for tourists - I don't believe that there was a local in sight.",March 2019,Teatro Timanfaya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187481-d5989838-Reviews-Teatro_Timanfaya-Puerto_de_la_Cruz_Tenerife_Canary_Islands.html,"Tenerife, Spain",attractions,3.0,4.5
Wonderfully calm and very beautiful,"Following a detailed map of the historical centre supplied by the Tourist Information Office in the Casa Alvarado Bracamonte (go inside and ask for one), I found my way to this convent, the entrance to which costs just €3. The Santa Clara Museum inside occupies part of this convent building, which was founded in the 16th century and is run by an enclosed order of nuns. The actual museum is, however, relatively small and contains various precious and beautiful artefacts, including paintings. In a room on the ground floor you can watch a short film about the history of the convent - there are three versions: Spanish, English and German. The chief delight, however, is to just wander around, in and out of the inner courtyards, savouring the peacefulness and beauty of the complex. Like the Convento de Santa Catalina facing Plaza del Adelantado, the convent has a distinctive carved wooden balcony and grille, behind which the enclosed nuns can gather to look out over the surrounding streets and buildings without being seen.

When I voiced my astonishment at the amount of gold and silver used in the adornment of the main altarpiece, he laughed and said, 'You know, we got that from the Americas...!' After I had seen around this wonderful old church, he encouraged me to nip next door into the former convent, which was just about to close for lunch.
