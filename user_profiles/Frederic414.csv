Beautiful place place ruined by poor staff.,"Not going to lie, I really enjoyed my experience of the Acropolis, nice views, nice monuments and a great view of the city below, better than the views up on the Areopagus hill, the time that I came on the 17th of April, 2019, there were little people on the area so my experience there wasn’t disturbed by multitudes of people, so overall it did lived up to the hype and is definitely recommended to others. But the reason I gave a low star is because of the unbearable staff members. When I arrived, at the ticket office, the member of staff viewed my combined ticket paper and pointed me to go over to the gate to get access using the sheet. With that in mind, I went to the office and gave them the sheet, so what they did is opening the pdf on the email and walked over to the ticket office, then she returned and for some reason called me a “liar” and held on my shoulder and attempted to push me away from the gates, with that I eventually went pass the gates on to the acropolis by getting my pass from the pass I bought from the Ancient Agora yesterday. Overall I believe that the staff are extremely unhelpful to the tourists and really require some bondage between them as they clearly cannot co-operate well and the woman at the gates should learn some manners as that she should learn to solve the problem instead of making it worse.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5
