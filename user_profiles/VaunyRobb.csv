Crowded,"We were excited to see this, and then we were told 5 minutes in that we couldnt take photos due to teh art being privately owned. I was not happy at all as its art and history, its owned by the people not a personal person, that makes me mad",August 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best EVER,"The location of the hotel was perfect, we didn't have to take a bus really anywhere in Athens, besides to the coast. The hotel is very modern. It was super clean, and the room was so nice, crisp and refreshing. The best part of the hotel was the staff and the bed. LOL. The staff were very interactive, even through we did not speak Greek they were able to speak some English and conversation with us and make us feel welcomed. They also joined our conversations during the evening when we were outside enjoying the night, as it was August and hot so we slept most of the day. The breakfast provided was amazing and this hotel was the only hotel that we have stayed at that checked to see what room you were in when you were dining for breakfast which came across to me as super efficient and i appreciated that. Now back to the bed, my husband and i flew to Rome, Italy from Spokane Washington, United States, in Rome we did not sleep well and were excited to explore, when it came to Athens we were on the same trip of hey this is once in a life time, we need to see everything, so when we landed in Athens we rode the bus to the square then walked a few blocks to the hotel (conveniently located), and we checked in. when we got to the room, we thought we will take a small nap and get up and explore. well to our surprise we hit the bed and we slept for 14 hours. I mean WOW, i haven't slept like that since i was a baby i bet, it was awesome. The next 3 nights we slept like rocks. It was amazing, and the night crew that were up when we were, talked to us all the time it was great.",August 2019,Best Western Plus Amazon Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d260275-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_Amazon_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
