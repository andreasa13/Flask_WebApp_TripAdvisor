Airport Overnighter,"I showed up without a reservation needing a room near the airport for one night. The staff were very friendly, and the room was nice with a good bathroom. There was free private parking which was great for me as I had a rental car. I think because of Covid, there was a very reduced breakfast offering available in your room included in the price.
The one problem was that the power went out at around midnight. I was still awake, but an alarm outside was going off, and the bright emergency lighting turned on in the room. The power came back after about an hour, but that sure wouldn't have been a great experience if you were sleeping at that time!",October 2020,Apartments Tina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2184506-d12676207-Reviews-Apartments_Tina-Artemida_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Artemida, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Mayonnaise Burger,"Came here for lunch and ordered a cocktail and burger. The cocktail was straight sugary strawberry syrup, and the burger may have been the worst burger I've ever had in my life. The bun was four sizes too large for the patty, and there was more mayonnaise than meat. It really was hardly edible...good thing there was a cat begging for food so he got a large portion of it.",October 2020,Feel The Rocks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315843-d15207582-Reviews-Feel_The_Rocks-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.0
First Time Rock Climbing!,"I did the beginner rock climbing course with one other tourist and totally loved it. I had never rock climbed in my life before but the guide was great, and we went up 30-40 meters multiple times and rappelled down.

Wonderful Service and Food,"I was in Kalambaka for three days and ate here twice. The servers were beyond nice - so friendly and attentive. There was also an adorable little dog that sat with me while I ate both times. I had mousaka and bean soup which were fantastic, and at the end of each meal they gave me a free dessert and raki.

Absolutely Magical,"I was lucky enough to travel Greece during Covid so experienced so many amazing places without the crowds...Meteora being one of them. I have heard that during a normal year at high season, the road connecting the monasteries can become a complete traffic jam and people are generally advised not to do the trip with their own vehicles. I however had my own rental car and did the entire circuit myself one day. There were hardly any people or tour buses and I had no problem whatsoever. You park on the road at each monastery, then hike the many stairs to access each one. Ladies need skirts below the knee that you either bring yourself or they have some to lend. If bringing your own, definitely wear tights or something to hike the stairs, and carry the skirt until you arrive at the top because it's not easy hiking all that in a skirt!
Each monastery was so peaceful and serene. Varying degrees of difficulty to get to each (though none very hard), and varying degrees of what you can see inside each. But all had stunning views over the mountains, other monasteries and towns below. You really feel so relaxed and calm - it's easy to understand why the monks chose to come all the way up there!",October 2020,Meteora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1070999-d523805-Reviews-Meteora-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Good Hotel Choice,"I showed up without a reservation and got a room for three nights. The room was comfortable, had a big balcony wrapping the corner of the building with views to Meteora, and was quiet at night. I had breakfast included which was simple, but more than good enough for me. The location is within walking distance to the main road of Kalambaka with all the restaurants and shops.",October 2020,Toti Boutique Rooms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315843-d3138610-Reviews-Toti_Boutique_Rooms-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
Fascinating Site,"After visiting the archaeological museum, I explored the site. It is very large which makes for a peaceful experience (at least during these Covid times).

Maybe Even Better Than the Athens Museums,"I visited the museum prior to going to the archaeological site, and was pleasantly surprised at how good the museum is. I had come from Athens and done the big museums there, so this was much smaller, however I thought the artifacts and displays were excellently done and just as interesting, if not more. When I arrived, I mistakenly thought that this museum was going to be about the history of the Olympic Games, but it was about the archaeology and history of the site. I loved the weaponry and armour displays, as well as the pediment reconstructions.",October 2020,Archaeological Museum of Olympia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189487-d243257-Reviews-Archaeological_Museum_of_Olympia-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Pleasantly Surprised,"I hiked up the stairs to the castle which was a pretty good workout, and was pleasantly surprised with the castle. There was a lot of spaces to see, and it felt nice that it wasn't overly regulated in that you were fairly free to roam around as you wanted without a bunch of signs or gates etc. The view over Nafplio and the sea was beautiful.",October 2020,Palamidi Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g319780-d2218054-Reviews-Palamidi_Castle-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Walk Along the Sea to Get Here,"You can either drive/walk up a road from the town to get here, or you can walk along the sea from the harbour/pier. There are gates saying that this walking path is closed due to falling rocks, but everyone was going around it and walking anyway. There were no issues I could see. It was so pretty at sunset.
The beach is pebbles and not sand, but there are rock ledges flanking either side of the beach with ladders installed on them where you can swim off of. The beach isn't much, but I liked the rock swimming better, and it's a nice place to check out.",October 2020,Arvanitia beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g319780-d8473402-Reviews-Arvanitia_beach-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0

Lovely Stay,"I was doing a week-long road trip through Greece and last minute decided to stop in Nafplio. I didn't have a reservation when I showed up but got a large room on the main floor with big bathroom. The employees working the front desk were all very friendly and helpful with suggestions of what to do and where to eat. The hotel offers laundry service that was done within a couple hours. Breakfast buffet was included and had an expansive, yummy selection. The restaurant area has full-height windows which makes for a lovely place to eat in the morning. There is also free public parking very close which was a big plus for me with a rental car.",October 2020,Leto Nuevo Hotel Nafplion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g319780-d648567-Reviews-Leto_Nuevo_Hotel_Nafplion-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Super Cute!,"I came here once for lunch and had a yummy cocktail and Greek salad. The second time I came I had raki that was served hot with honey, like an alcoholic tea.

"Nice Place, Meh Cocktails","I had heard a lot about this bar being one of the top 50 bars in the world so made a point to check it out. Perhaps I didn't make a great cocktail selection, but I found it overly sweet and it tasted like a fake strawberry syrup or something was used...and far too much of it.

A Must See,"I visited the Acropolis during Covid, so was so lucky to have experienced the site without the hoards of tourists that would normally be there. The entire site is very interesting along with the Acropolis Museum. The one thing that ruins the ambience is the employees who walk around the grounds, blowing whistles at people who are coming too close to something they shouldn't be. I could have done without the incessant, ear shattering squeals. That aside, the site is absolutely a must-see in Athens.",October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Ideal Plaka Location,"Showed up without a reservation and wound up staying here six nights. The room was small but perfect for just me, with a small balcony. My one complaint is that the elevator was extremely rackety. I took the stairs as my room was only on the second floor, but I constantly heard other guests taking it, and it was brutally loud. Breakfast was included and was good, and they also offered laundry service which I used. There is a nice rooftop patio with views to the Acropolis.

Go here!!!,"After renting a car to drive to Elafonisi Beach, I randomly noticed this beach on my Google Maps and decided to check it out. Wow, best decision ever! I actually loved this way more than Elafonisi. There were all of 15 people when I arrived, and I've never seen water more gorgeously blue in all my life. The drive down to the parking lot is tight switchbacks, where you're greeting by goats who are curious to know if you have any food for them. From here you scramble down the side of the mountain (there is a trail), and end encircled in this little spectacular paradise.",October 2020,Seitan Limania Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1925969-d4932230-Reviews-Seitan_Limania_Beach-Akrotiri_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Beautiful, but Slightly Disappointing","Don't get me wrong, the beach is big and beautiful, but maybe I saw too many edited photos of the beach before going which made me slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't nearly as pink as I was expecting it to be. The sand is only slightly pink, and in only certain areas and only really visible in sunlight. I really liked the area though where you had to wade through around waist-deep water to get to a second sandy beach portion away from all the sun chairs and umbrellas.
Also I don't know if it is always windy there, but holy smokes, the day I went was crazy, and actually cold enough that I didn't even go swimming.",October 2020,Elafonissi Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1535800-d1536672-Reviews-Elafonissi_Beach-Elafonissi_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Highlight of my Entire Greece Vacation,"Did the Samaria Gorge hike with Io Tours, and it was definitely the highlight of my 3+ week trip throughout Greece. It is a fairly strenuous hike but so worth it. The various terrain that you go through and the scenery is magical. There are some washrooms along the way, and natural springs where you can fill your water bottle. We started with an early morning bus ride (6:30am pick up) from Chania to the top of the gorge. From here it is 13km to the end of the gorge, plus another 3km to the town of Agia Roumeli where there are restaurants and a beach to swim at. I think the entire 16km took me about 5 hours. Here a ferry takes you to the nearby town of Sougia where the bus is waiting to take you back to Chania, ending around 9pm.",October 2020,Samaria Gorge National Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2396903-d254264-Reviews-Samaria_Gorge_National_Park-Sfakia_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

The Best Meal I Had in Chania,"Came here for dinner while travelling on my own, and it was hands-down the best meal I had in all of Chania.

Good Backdrop and Snorkelling,"Took the bus from Perissa here, and walked over and down to the beach instead of taking the boat transportation. The beach area itself is small and not that amazing, but the massive red cliff backdrop is very neat, and there was some good snorkelling off to the one end near the rocks. The short hike down to the beach over the rocks from the parking lot is easy. Yes there are signs saying the beach is closed because of falling rocks, but I found this notice in various other places I went throughout Greece, and all were still visited by many people...no issue.",October 2020,Red Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1189834-d641334-Reviews-Red_Beach-Akrotiri_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,3.5

"Cliff Jumping, Stairs and Fish Taverns","I walked all the stairs down to the bay in Oia and walked them all back which is a serious workout, but I believe there is a road if you wanted to drive instead. The bay is very pretty with lots of fish restaurants lining the edge. If you keep walking along, there is a trail over the rocks that takes you to Ammoudi Beach (though not a beach at all, but just a space on the rocks to go swimming from). There is a small island a short distance from shore that you can swim to and cliff jump from. Perhaps 20-25 ft. high.

Second Half of the Hike is Pretty,"Hiked this trail to Maidenhair Falls around Christmas.

Totally Basic,"The hotel was fine for us as we really only used it as a place to sleep, and were out doing activities all day long. Room was clean, staff was friendly. Breakfast could have been much better as it basically only consisted of toast, corn flakes, fruit, juice and coffee. The wifi seemed to go out every day, and I constantly had to go to the front desk to have them reset the router. It always started working again after that, but very sketchy. The walls and floor/ceiling were very thin and we could clearly hear our neightbors beside and above us stomping around and talking all night long.",December 2018,Travelodge by Wyndham Indio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32524-d77341-Reviews-Travelodge_by_Wyndham_Indio-Indio_Greater_Palm_Springs_California.html,"Indio, California",hotels,3.0,3.0
Good But a Little Kitschy,"Service was very good and the food was decent. The fact that the restaurant is built right into the side of the cliff is pretty amazing.

Betto Tours / Giselle Tours,"First off, I apologize in advance for the length of this review, but it really all needs to be said. My boyfriend and I booked a four-day tour in Uyuni with Giselle Tours, however the tour operator wound up being Betto Tours (unbeknownst to us until we left on the tour). I am writing the majority of my review here as it was my understanding that Betto was the tour operator, however please read my review on Giselle Tour's page for further information on their role in this whole saga).

We started our tour with Giselle/Betto with a group of five of us, plus the driver Willy. We had a wonderful first two days going to Tunupa Volcano and seeing the salt flats. This was by far the best part of the entire trip. I would definitely tell everyone reading this to book a four-day tour rather than a three day. The volcano is spectacular (like a mini- Rainbow Mountain), and you get to climb it if you want!

Willy was an absolutely wonderful tour guide and driver. However, on the second day, my boyfriend and I had to transfer to a different a driver in a different jeep with a different group of four other people. This was because Willy and our original group were going back to Uyuni as they had only signed up for a two-day tour, whereas we were continuing on to Chile.

The new driver was Marcus, and it was unclear if he was an employee of Betto or Giselle, or perhaps a third company called Fortaleza Tours, as three of the other tourists in this group had actually booked their tour through Fortaleza. However I believe he was with Betto.
And this is where it all started going downhill. MARCUS WAS HORRIBLE.

Here are some examples:

-Not on time: one morning we were told to be ready to leave the salt hotel at 5am to go see the sunrise. Therefore, we all woke up and got ready for this time. Marcus did not get out of his bed until 6am. Thanks.

-At one point while driving, I could see in his rear-view mirror that he was falling asleep while driving. Shortly thereafter, we proceed to hit a huge hill, rock or something, going at least 60km/hr (the speedometers do not seem to work on any of these jeeps), which sent all of us in the vehicle flying through the air. Heads smashed into the ceiling, arms got caught in windows. Wonderful.

-Another point while driving, we also hit a pothole or something, also going way too fast for the ""road"" we were on, and he completely blew out a tire. We had to stop, and luckily another jeep was approaching, so they stopped to help change the tire.

-Shortly after this happened, the other jeep that was now driving along with us, somehow managed to completely destroy their driveshaft and could no longer drive. We stopped to help them, but it was virtually beyond the repair that could be done in the middle of the desert with nothing and no one around. Instead of Marcus just taking them to the last town to get parts/tools, or call for a replacement vehicle, we wasted four whole hours sitting in the middle of the desert, driving the other driver back and forth to the nearest town, who after three failed attempts at obtaining the correct parts, did not have the parts required to fix the vehicle!!! In the end, we finally left the other driver and tour group - again to reiterate - in the middle of the desert, to wait for help. But only after our tour group wasted an entire morning of the tour we paid for, for no reason! Therefore, the rest of our day was beyond rushed. We had ten minutes at all the remaining spots on the itinerary for that day (which were a lot!), so we were not able to really appreciate any of them. Not to mention, the last stop was Laguna Colorada which we were really looking forward to seeing, and instead we got to ""see"" it in the dark. Cool.

-And here's the icing on the cake: There were three of us out of the six in the tour group that were transferring into Chile on the final day. The other three were going back to Uyuni. Our bus tickets to transfer into Chile were for 9am (please read my review on Giselle Tour's page for further information on this), but Marcus proceeds to tell us that we can arrive anytime between 9 and 10:30am, and it will be fine. We do not know any better, and are forced to trust Marcus, because hey, you would think this guy has done this 500 times before, right? So this must be the way it works? Not even close. We arrive at the Bolivian border just before 10:30am. Now the Bolivian border is literally a hut – again - in the middle of the desert with nothing else around. The Chilean border - which is actually a real building - is a few miles further down the road. At the Bolivian border, there were still buses and other jeeps dropping people off, however our bus company was nowhere to be seen. Marcus had already left immediately after dropping us off, rather than actually handing us over to the bus company; which we found out after, was actually the process that was supposed to take place. Soon, there was no one left at the border, except for the three of us, with our backpacks, in the middle of the desert! Luckily my boyfriend can speak Spanish, so was trying to figure out how this happened, and what to do now, with the border agent. We really had no other option, other than to start walking to Chile. Just as we had lost hope (I was crying), a bus is coming towards us from Chile. It was another driver that we had happened to talk to earlier while we were looking for our bus. I guess he made it to Chile, found our bus there (they had already left Bolivia at 9am, as per our tickets), and realized that we were going to be stuck. Thankfully, he took us to the Chilean border (not without us repaying him for our bus tickets of course), and we were able to continue on with another company to San Pedro.

So to conclude this rollercoaster of a review, all of the sights along the way of the tour are other-worldly and fascinating, and staying in the very basic salt hotels was an adventure in itself. In that sense, 100% I would tell anyone going to Bolivia to make sure they do the salt flat tour, however everything that went wrong on our tour, I 100% blame on Marcus. Whether this is Betto's or Giselle's or Fortaleza's employee, he needs to fired immediately. Willy on the other hand, is deserving of a promotion and so much praise. Unfortunately, this review cannot properly capture which tour company was responsible for what given the lack of information we received at the time, and the multiple different players involved. But in the end, we paid for a four-day tour, and really only got a two-and-a-half-day tour after losing a whole morning due to vehicle issues, and the last day not really being a day at all (ie: having to be at the border for 9am- refer to Giselle Tours' review).",April 2018,Betto Tours - Day Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g317033-d8760106-Reviews-Betto_Tours_Day_Tours-Uyuni_Potosi_Department.html,"Uyuni, Bolivia",attractions,4.0,3.5
Unique!,"We rented a motorcycle to drive around the Sacred Valley and take in various archaeological sites. Moray was very interesting in that I have never seen anything like it before. It is included in the Boleto Turistico, so if you already have that are in the area or passing by, I would definitely recommend to stop and see the site.

Magical,"We woke up at 3:30am to hike up the Inca Steps to see the sunrise at Machu Picchu. The hike was semi-tough in that it was all stairs and you are dripping in sweat once you reach the top, but seeing the golden sunlight wash over the site at 6:30am was worth every second. It is also nice being there that early because there are not as many tourists. Come 10am the place is crawling, even in off-season when we went. The site itself is quite small, but the surrounding mountains and landscapes are some of the most beautiful I have seen. Make sure to do the trail to the Inca Drawbridge. The bridge itself isn't the most exciting thing, but the trail and scenery is awesome! Overall, out of my whole 4 week vacation through Peru, Bolivia and Chile, I wasn't that excited to see Machu Picchu (I'm probably the only person every to say that), but I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it. Definitely not be missed...even with the crowds.",March 2018,Santuario Historico de Machu Picchu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294318-d668949-Reviews-Santuario_Historico_de_Machu_Picchu-Machu_Picchu_Sacred_Valley_Cusco_Region.html,"Machu Picchu, Peru",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Awesome Time, but No Photos :(","First off, there is nothing dangerous about biking this road; it is completely safe.That being said though, I always thought I was a decent mountain biker until I biked this road. It is a tough workout! The road is very bumpy so your body get shook up pretty good, and I also got some serious blisters on my hands, but the experience was so fun! The scenery is beautiful and our tour guide was great. The tour ended at the hotel where you get a pretty good buffet lunch, and you can also swim in a pool. When we signed up for the tour, we didn't really care about this end part, but trust me, after all that biking, you're going to want a swim to cool down and relax!
The first part of the bike down the road is pretty cold, but the second half is very hot. Bring a change of clothes. Not to mention, you are going to get filthy! Even with the full gear they give you to wear, your own clothes are going to get very dirty. Also bring bug spray. We didn't realize until after the tour that we got covered in bug bites. Not mosquitoes, but small gnat-like things that you don't feel biting.
Redline was great, except my one complaint is that it has been almost a month since we took the tour, and they are ignoring my emails where I am requesting the photos. We could not bring our own cameras on the tour, so those photos are the only ones we would have the experience, so it is sad not to have them.",April 2018,Red Line,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294072-d11851324-Reviews-Red_Line-La_Paz_La_Paz_Department.html,"La Paz, Bolivia",attractions,4.0,4.5
HUGE,"We took the teleferico up to El Alto to check out the Sunday market which was a totally easy and fast way to get up there (WAY better than taking a taxi from La Paz!). Some of the reviews I read before going talked about the market (and El Alto in general) being a dangerous place. We had no issues in the market or in El Alto at all, but do keep your bags close just because of the sheer number of people.
The market was HUGE! Do not go expecting to buy anything, or find anything catering to tourists whatsoever. This is entirely a local market, where everything from cell phones, clothing, birds, food, car parts and building materials are sold. There are also some huts along the perimeters where shamans and ""witches"" will read your tarot cards and coca leaves. We tried one out, but I am not sure how legit it actually was.",April 2018,El Alto Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2053387-d7395626-Reviews-El_Alto_Market-El_Alto_La_Paz_Department.html,"El Alto, Bolivia",attractions,3.0,3.5
Stay the Night,"Isla del Sol is absolutely magical; it is very clear to see why it was so important to the Incas. It is easy to spend the whole day hiking, and it was beaitufl to see the sun set on one side of the island, and then it rise on the other. Lake Titicaca is breakthtaking; it is like an ocean it is so big, but calm without boat traffic. I definitely would recommend spending the night on the island. It is a wonderful place to recharge and relax, as well as hike surrounded by llamas, alpacas, sheep and donkeys, and see one the most beautiful places on earth.",April 2018,Isla del Sol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297316-d554191-Reviews-Isla_del_Sol-Copacabana_La_Paz_Department.html,"Copacabana, Bolivia",attractions,5.0,4.5

Biking Valle de la Luna,"We rented bikes first thing in the morning to go through Valle de la Luna to try to avoid the midday heat and sun. This was a good idea as you are the only ones in the park first thing in the morning, and the bike rentals in San Pedro are typically for 6 hours or a full day. With the 6 hour rental we had just enough time to get through the whole park, stopping at each of the attractions/sights, and back to the rental company. That was going pretty quickly though. If you want to not be rushed, just get the whole day rental. The bike ride is pretty hilly with good inclines and declines, so be ready for a workout. Bring LOTS of water and some snacks.
Valle de la Luna was very cool - more so than I thought it would be. Most of the stops through the park are very good, including the cave and a huge sand dune, but a few are a little boring including the mine and Tres Marias (unfortunately this the last stop at the end of the park).",April 2018,Valle De La Luna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303681-d315617-Reviews-Valle_De_La_Luna-San_Pedro_de_Atacama_Antofagasta_Region.html,"San Pedro de Atacama, Chile",attractions,5.0,4.5
So Much Fun!,"We did the morning tour time, with a total group size of 6 people plus the driver and instructor. The instructor was great, and we got right into riding down the dune.

Amazing to See the Southern Sky,"Coming from the northern hemisphere, it was so interesting to see a completely different sky. You don't realize how familiar you are with the night sky until you see it from a totally different perspective, and are thrown completely out of whack.
Jorge was a wonderful guide and provided fantastic customer service through booking and throughout the evening. I cannot speak to other stargazing tours that are offered in San Pedro, but I feel like this tour far exceeded any others. More and better telescopes, a smaller group of people, a real astronomer (not just some tour company), etc. etc...you definitely get what you pay for.

I see that some of the other recent reviews talked about it being noisy due to construction in the adjacent restaurant. There was definitely construction going on, however we were on the fourth floor and had no issues with noise. So perhaps requesting the fourth (which is the top) floor would be beneficial.
