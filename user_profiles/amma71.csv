Jain temples on the hill: Beautiful architecture.,"1. Yes you climb about 3500 steps. But they are easy steps and some flat walking in between.

2. Definitely start as early as you can to beat the sun and heat

3. WATER: They DO NOT allow plastic bottles. Westerners seem like exception as they were carrying it. Water is available on the way, but if you are concerned about drinking water everywhere like us, then plan to carry metal containers for water. This was tough part of our trip as we did not get to drink water for a few hours.

4. They may NOT allow leather hand bags, purses, camera bags etc.

5. Camera: You can take pictures outside. Once inside the shrine cameras are NOT allowed. That is where the beautiful architecture is. So think if it is worth carrying heavy SLR cameras.

6. Yes the trip can be completed in 4-5 hours if you want to, But why? Engross yourself in majesty of so many temples and plan to spend some leisurely time.

7. You don't have to be religious to immerse yourself in the scintillating experience.
