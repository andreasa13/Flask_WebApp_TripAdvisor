"Good service, not an Atelier","I ate lunch twice these last few days. The serve was excellent and the food good, but not with the finesse we experience in the old London Atelier or in other Robuchon restaurants. However, the prices here are also lower. The Sunday roast special offers too much food for a single person. The shank was good but the two sides were uninteresting and the few specks of truffles on the macaroni with cheese did not justify the £10 surcharge. The desert was OK. Overall good value but not exceptional.",February 2020,Le Comptoir Robuchon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d19381841-Reviews-Le_Comptoir_Robuchon-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Nice terrace, good food, too long a wait for lunch","At 11:30 we told the waitstaff when ordering that we had to leave by 12:40 and please ensure that we could do so. We waited 45 minutes for the grilled cheese sandwiches and for me the fish and chips to arrive. The fish was good, lots of batter, the chips were bland and uninteresting. Overall, the food was what one might expect for the price. If we were not in a rush, the leisurely pace would have been fine.

"Stale bread, over cooked veal, rude","The oysters, fries and ice cream were good. The veal chop was hard, over cooked I assume. My friend had tasteless mussels.

"Wonderful atmosphere, good service","A German friend and I celebrated my wife's birthday here and had an excellent dining experience. We were served a sparkling wine on arrival, a nice surprise. The dining room is beautifully designed with contrast between the elegant table settings and the rustic stone walls of the palace that had once been partially destroyed.

We started with the ""Entrée variation with shrimp and rocket, tuna sashimi, gratinated scallop and grilled calamaretti"", a marvelous dish superbly prepared by the chef. The Monk fish main was proper, a little bland for my taste. The sides came cafeteria style and I would have preferred a better integration of fish with the accompanying vegetables. There was no design in the plating. The Crepes Suzette was prepared at the table adding a dramatic finish to the meal.

The service was excellent, careful and professional. The recommended wine was right on and to my surprise, moderately priced. After the main course we were asked if we wanted to wait a while for the dessert or to have it right away.

Dissapointing,"The setting is nice and service is OK. The soup was fine though bland. The salmon was over cooked and dry. It looked like it had been cooked once and reheated. It came really hot to the table and Avery even begibibg chef knows that that is a sign that the fish is over cooked. It is so easy to cook salmon properly. The glaze on the fish was very nice.

"Excellent room and location, locked fire escape door, supper huge variation in price","We have stayed here several times over the last twenty years and really like the location and the large rooms. Having a coffee maker in room would be a good improvement. The buffet breakfast is OK.

I was surprised at the huge variation in the hotel bill: two nights at 360 euros EACH, then two at about 90 euros and one at 55 or so. As to value, one star for the high price ( choir Olympics were on and we got the last available room) and five stars for the other rates. Had I checked before the booking , we might have split our stay in two hotels. The 360 euro per night rate is just 20 euros short of what a store clerk in old Riga told us she was payed each month for working 12 hour days.

Our room was at the far end of a convoluted set of corridors and had a nearby stair to a fire exit as shown in the first photo. The heavy door to the alley was locked. A sign asking clients to keep the door closed implied that it was openable. We tried to push it but the lock was secure. We reported to the front desk what should clearly be a serious violation of the fire code but nothing changed over the next four days.",July 2017,Rixwell Hotel Konventa Sēta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274967-d277634-Reviews-Rixwell_Hotel_Konventa_Seta-Riga_Riga_Region.html,"Riga, Latvia",hotels,3.0,4.0

Excellent organization of Jordan trip as well,"Mehedi helped us not only in Wadi Rum but with our whole trip in Jordan. For a small fee ($12 US) he got us an excellent taxi driver, Ahmed, with a new spacious car. Mehedi does not take a commission on the taxi so we got the taxi for five days to cross Jordan at the normal taxi rate, very reasonable.

The Wadi Rum trip was in a covered jeep which we found comfortable and would not have wanted to be on the back bench in a 4 by 4 pickup as were most of the other tourists we saw in the site.

The Bedouin Direction camp is surrounded by large blocks of stone, keeping the wind out but also the views. It is comfortable with running water toilets and a shower. The large dining tent is comfortable with lots of cushions. The supper on the first night was cooked in an underground oven and was excellent. Supper the second day more basic. We were the only two tourists in ten camp this cold February day.

The first day out took us on a fixed route to some seven places. Other tours joined us and the drivers enjoyed gossip and tea in the nearby tents. The second day offered a climb on Jordan's highest mountain. We did not do it but drove to the starting point after which it looks like a 450 meter climb. The track did not look comfortable as there is some scrambling involved and it definitely needs a guide (cost about 35 JD). We did enjoy the extra day in the dessert with a visit to a Bedouin nomads tent an camels and sheep. Our driver was an excellent cook.

"Overpriced, small servings but sort of OK food","We each had a watery lentil soup and I had shshkebob with a few fries while my friend had two humus style appetizers with some dry pita bread. We also had two teas ar 1.5 Dinars a tea bag. The meal came to 25 JD, a little under $40 US, or $50 Cdn. My friend from London also thought that the price for the quality and serving size we got was about twice what it would have been at home. On way back to the hotel, another restauranteur invited us to consider them tomorrow. We told him what we thought of the value in his neighbours restaurant and were told that taxes are very high and the price of lamb had been rising.

Hardly any cash on hand. 45 minutes later after calls to card company in Japan and in Canada told there was no problem with the card. We then learned that the restaurant had a PIN entering device but didn't think it was needed as the cards for other clients could be charged without the number. Not for us!

We went to the front desk, entered the card's PIN and it all worked. A lesson for everyone.

The food was very good and we could see it being assembled in front of us. The first wonderful dish was built arround a small scoup of cooked eggplant ice cream. The tastes of the 8 dishes were harmonized, earthy and complex but no highlights. The rice dish at the end was too ordinary for a restaurant in this price class.

The food is good, not terribly innovative and only two of the dishes were remarkable in my opinion - the watermelon soup and the dessert. The soup presented a blend of flavours highlighted by the small slices of cucumber tinged with chilli. The caramelized ginger on the chocolate on top of the almond mouse was brilliant. The pork belly was on the dry side, the halibut was OK but nothing to write home about, the beef was very good but I may have missed its organic subtlety.

very good food but a somewhat disappointing experience,"I enjoyed the food but the setting is more like a hotel restaurant with a busy feel and more noise than one might expect in a one star restaurants. The service was lackluster and did not contribute to our dining experience. The dishes were brought out by young possibly inexperienced servers who rattled off their content and had to be asked in every case to repeat what they had said. They could not answer questions. The sommelier helped us chose an uninteresting Riesling for 51 pounds. Most of the dishes were unnecessarily deep - at the finish the fork and spoon would inelegantly slide into the bowl handle and all. The bare Formica tabletop, the noise level and perfunctory service, overly large dishes detracted from the chef’s excellent work.
The food was expertly prepared and was, as some other reviewers have commented, somewhat bland on occasion but that might be the nature of nouveau-Islandic cuisine so I can’t complain. Although I had eaten lamb recently in two star restaurants, this lamb was by far the best I have ever had. Of course it was perfectly pink but it had depth of flavour and a perfect texture. The lamb dish was memorable as was the preceding course presenting a drumstick and a bit of breast of an Anjou quail. I only wish that quail were larger birds, the dish was wonderful and complex. I was particularly looking forward to the smoked eel course but was disappointed by the size of the serving. I have never seen such a small piece of fish on a plate even in a fourteen course tasting menu. My disappointment with the quantity marred my enjoyment of its quality. I was surprised by the subtlety of the taste and wished I had a better chance to explore it.
The pre-desert was a palate cleanser, not a desert, and I have forgotten the amuse bouche we had at the start. I think it was cold. The chips brought to the table were uninteresting, the bread vas good with nice accompanying olive oil and salt. Overall I could have had more food in the four or five courses but my three friends were satisfied with both the quantity and quality but said they would not come back. The madeleines at the end were great! The pace of service good.
I believe that there is more potential here and wish that Chef Sverrisson would present his culinary art in a quieter more conventional setting with a better trained and personable waitstaff and on tables with white tablecloths in dishes that are not quit as deep.

"Good food, nice setting, excellent service","This is a solid two star restaurant offering a consistent set of dishes. I was pleased with all of my dishes. My daughter took the vegetarian option and liked it but felt that another two star restaurant in London offered more innovation.

The eight course menus with the cheese option took a leisurely four and half hours, a nice way to spend time with a grown up daughter. The setting is very pleasant and the service outstanding and added to our enjoyment of the evening. It was attentive but not intrusive, friendly but also professional. We were served by a number of people who brought their individual personalities. The sommelier gave us an very good wine at a reasonable price (49£). At the end we enjoyed our conversation with our head and we took a tour of the kitchen. It was past midnight and the restaurant was closing. Again, I can not speak highly enough of the quality of service.

Try the cheese option, the explanation of the varieties is worth the added price. Take care ordering gin and tonics as they have some excellent but pricy options.

Excellent big city restaurant in a small town,"We enjoyed the evening on this small informal restaurant. Each of the dishes we (4 of us) had were outstanding. The servings were generous.

"Good food, huge, loud inside, nice outside","We ordered the chef's selection for $55 each. The dishes were very good and the quantity ample. The seafood dishes were somewhat more satisfying than the meat. The kebabs were uninteresting and dry, the deserts delicious. My wife's salmon was properly cooked and good.

This is a large restaurant with a set of standardized dishes, nothing innovative here. The service was courteous and responsive to requests except for our second set of drinks. We had to wait too long for a second glass of beer and had to ask twice. Beer doesn't go well with dessert. There were a number of waitstaff that appeared to be just standing around while our main waiter appeared very busy.

Very ordinary food with lacklustre service,"We were brought in by the posted all inclusive menus and upscaled to their 30 euro Sardinian special. The antipasto very ordinary in a city where you can get wonderful salami etc in supermarkets. The second and the main felt like they came from a big pot. Greasy potatoes, hard overlooked tasteless beef. My colleague had a tasteless pasta dish and asked for oil and vinegar for her salad. She got two bottles of oil. Eventually I had to go to the other room to ask our waiter, who was leaning against a wall eying the front door.
The house wine was almost unpleasant.

Surprised by extra charge that seemed unjustified.,"In the past trips to the US I have ordered packages to be sent to my hotel and it has always worked well. It cost a nice tip, that is all. Here. Had a package sent to me and I was told to pay the hotel $25 to receive it! What could I do, no choice? It cost me $17 to have the package shipped from California, picked up, processed, shipped, processed and dropped off at the hotel. How can holding it at the hotel cost $25? I felt cheated, it felt like extortion. I won't stay at a Hyatt if I can help it.

As others have complained the AC is very loud even on the 26th floor. Otherwise the hotel is neat and the staff are courteous and helpful.

Great food but much too noisy and busy!,"Great food, terrible environment.
We arrived at our reserved time and had to wait twenty minutes to be seated. The restaurant was full and very busy. After complaining, we were compensated for the wait with free drinks. OK. Now three of us ordered the tasting menus with eight or so small courses. It took almost three hours to finish. In a high end restaurant this would be fine but not here, at least not for us. We were ready to leave before the last course (a delicious dessert). The noise level made the waiting between courses painful. We could hardly hear each other talk. The acoustics are terrible in this long narrow restaurant with sound reflective walls and ceiling. Given the noise, the time between dishes was far too long.

My first visit to Morimotos a little more than a year ago was early in the evening before the restaurant was full and I had no noise problem while sitting at the sushi bar.

The service was very proper but we could hardly hear the rushed explanations of the dishes. The waitstaff were rushed. The staff are well trained and very courteous. They did try to respond to our complaint about the noise level and did turn down the music a little. This helped a little but the sound generated by the other customers was still above our comfort level. I have been in only one other restaurant as noisy as this, in San Francisco on 4th Avenue and unfortunately it is now closed.

Now for the food. In some ways I enjoyed it even more than the first time. The sashimi was superb. The taste combinations in the foie gras dish memorable. The flavors throughout were subtle and complex. In my opinion Morimotos would rate a Micheline star if it was not for the noise and busyness of the place. The $150 tasting menu is good value were it not for .....

I like the food enough to to want to come back but my wife and our two friends while agreeing that the food was great would not set foot in this restaurant. We noticed that most of the other people here were young. Perhaps it is our age, our retirement status and pace of life, that makes us want to eat superb food in a calmer setting.

Innovative wonderful food at a high a price,"The food was indeed excellent. The preparation illustrated the chef's great skill. He did not have to add flourishes to the plates to impress. The quality was just there in the preparation without tricks.

The restaurant's entry was a little hard to find even though we were on the right street and city block. The room with four tables is unimpressive with dark walls. An ikebana would help the feel of the room. The chef works at one side, impressive. His wife offered friendly service. The dishes were well introduced.

The only option was the 50,000 yen per person tasting menu paired with drinks. The price is reasonable given the small size of the restaurant but we do not eat that often in restaurants at this high level and would value more a Micheline two or three star restaurant offering a little more drama for the price. This restaurant is for serious foodies.",September 2015,Takazawa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14129743-d1230028-Reviews-Takazawa-Akasaka_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Akasaka, Japan",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Good overpriced food,"the setting is beautiful, the service perfect and the food was in part excellent and some was average. The mackerel with mussels and a side of asparagus ice cream was almost at the level of a one star Micheline restaurant, a bit complicated but the contrasts memorable. My wife's lobster appeared a bit dry. My sweetbreads a bit over cooked and with too much salt on one side.

The food was good but I have had at times much better for the same price in London, Montreal, New York, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Tokyo and a few other places. Looking over me use in other Quebec City restaurants, this restaurant is not out of place, the prices here are high and in our next trip, we will stay with more modest meals and do the high class dining in other cities.

Great sushi,"With the first bite, we all realized that we are far from the corner sushi bar, we were not in the same league, not even in the same sport. There is a symphony of taste in this small piece of chutoro on rice. All the other sushi was delicious, subtly flavored at times and well presented. The fish-rice balance was perfect and the rice itself was good. Our chef was personable and our conversations enhanced the quality of the dining experience. The waitstaff was appropriately attentive without being obvious. We had a marvelous dinner and I have to work hard to find some minor points to add as a critique.

The sushi in the Omakase menu was superb but the duck miso soup was only ‘very good’ in my opinion. The dashi was perhaps too plain for my taste. I had expected more from the kaisui uni I had after the Omakase, the very small portion on a spoon was tasteful and I can still remember it well, a good sign of its quality and complexity, but I prefer the traditional presentation of uni on a bed of rice held in by a ring of high quality nori to fully fill my mouth with the scent of the sea. Also, I have seen chefs grate wasabi just before forming their sushi and was told that they do this because wasabi loses its heat in about five minutes after being grated. I did not gain much from the pre-prepared wasabi that was being drawn from a small bowl.

When we first sat down, I asked the chef what fish was particularly good today and got the response that first time customers typically get in a high end Tokyo restaurant, “it is all high quality, fresh… it depends on your taste” (i.e. “we don’t know you at all and will save today’s best find at the market for our valued customers”). After the Omakase, he recommend the “lightly cherry wood smoked golden eye snapper” and it really was exceptional. After a more visits, he may be more open in sharing his views on the day’s best finds.
Overall, a great meal, a solid one Michelin star restaurant.",December 2014,Kusakabe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d6665437-Reviews-Kusakabe-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Excellent sushi,"I had an early supper at Morimoto's and was impressed. I ordered the special for $150 and got an eight course meal. Overall it was not as creative or subtle as the same priced meal at Tojo's in Vancouver but it is one of the very best Japanese restaurant I have eaten in in North America.

Now the first courses were nice, the half lobster was perfect in a hot sauce, the weigo beef was again the among the best I've had. I asked if it really was from Japan and the waiter brought out the certificate. I had a nice conversation with the head sushi chef who was from Japan. We could talk about the differences in unago from Tokyo Bay and the ocean and about the best season for different fish. He was clearly very knowledgable.

The most impressive course was the six or seven sushi pieces at the end. They were the best I have had outside Japan or Vancouver. The scallop was from Hokaido. I have not had barracuda sushi before, nor a couple of the other fish. They were perfect and I would go back just for the sushi.",October 2014,Morimoto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60795-d433450-Reviews-Morimoto-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Nothing Japanese here,"Yes, the menu does look like as if it offers Japanese food but the servings have nothing of the refinement and clarity typical of Japanese cuisine. The salmon sashimi was fine but the tuna was tasteless and had to be served seared. We inferred after a conversation with our waiters that they couldn't serve the tuna raw because the fish was not sushi quality. The combination sushi sashimi included two tired cooked shrimp sushi and two processed fish sticks, pollock, most likely. The rice had no quality.

The restaurant is dark and has no feel of Japan at all. The tempura offers a couple of large chunks of broccoli that we left after a bite. The special roll our friends had was an ambitious multi ingredient confused item, impressive to look at but only the hot sauce offered a distinct taste.
