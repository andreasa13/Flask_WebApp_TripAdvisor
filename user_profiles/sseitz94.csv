Great for food and a little shopping.,"This place has lots of restaurants that cater to westerners. You can find an arrangement of choices such as Turkish, Mexican, Italian, and German food here.

Great for families!,"This place is a great way to get your child excited about traveling. It shows you lots of significant landmarks from around the world. There are a few rides along with some shows as well in the park. In the park, you can buy a fake passport and stamp all of the places that you have been to within the park. This is great to get kids excited about traveling.",May 2021,Shenzhen Window of the World,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297415-d502989-Reviews-Shenzhen_Window_of_the_World-Shenzhen_Guangdong.html,"Shenzhen, China",attractions,4.0,4.0
Amazing Turkish Food!,"If you're missing a bit of Turkish food from your travels or back home, this is the place to go.

Good Spot and Experience,"This hotel is in the Gangken Hakka Town. As it gets busy around the holidays, it's nice to beat the crowd and stress of traffic by staying in the hotel there. The hotel is nice and has numerous pieces of artwork. The staff are helpful, the rooms are clean, and it's very cozy. The one negative thing is that you can easily hear everything outside your room.

"Great, Organized, and Helpful","Riley Guo did a wonderful job in helping me with this trip. With new regulations in regard to Covid, it was going to be a bit trickier than normal to travel around China; especially being a foreigner. Riley helped me obtain all of the health codes and was there to help me through the process. She made it very easy. The cruise itself was wonderful along with the extra excursions. It was a great break from work. They even had English speaking guides and managers on the particular boat.

Wonderful and Relaxing,"I was a bit nervous about taking a cruise during this time, but this company did a wonderful job. They made sure I was taken care of, enjoyed my time, and were always available to help when needed. Since I'm an American, it was a bit more difficult to get all of the health codes and documents ready for the trip, but a girl named Riley helped me through everything. She was even available when I had questions about finding the bus station or anything else I needed help with during the entire trip. I would book another cruise with this company again.

Breathtaking and Relaxing,"This was an excursion I took part in from my cruise ship. The scenery was amazing and everything was peaceful. We weren't allowed to disembark for the day, but just the boat tour around was enough. Our tour guide was very informative as well. She told us about the culture and history of the people living in the area.

Great and Hassle Free,"Last week, I took a solo trip and booked a cabin on the Yangtze River Cruise. It was a 5 day 4 night trip that went from Yichang to Chongqing. The cruise was absolutely wonderful. It was a bit of a headache to find the bus station in Yichang, but after that everything was smooth sailing. The people on board are wonderful and helpful. If you are an English speaker, they will make sure to assign you to a group for tours that provides English translation. Since there were so few English speaking people on the tour I went on, they did both Chinese and English. Everything is very organized. I decided to upgrade and get the premium dining on the 6th floor and was very glad. I was seated at a small table with just myself. If I had chosen to go to the normal dining area, I would've been at a large table with other people I didn't know. This was especially nice as an extra precaution. All of the staff were very helpful when it came to booking any tours and made sure that I was well taken care of. I would book another cruise with this company again. I thoroughly enjoyed my time on the boat and taking the numerous excursions. They were very informative. Also, I booked through Yangtze River Cruises online, and a woman named Riley was extremely helpful in making this all run smoothly.",September 2020,Yangtze River Cruise Yichang Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297438-d17435062-Reviews-Yangtze_River_Cruise_Yichang_Tour-Yichang_Hubei.html,"Yichang, China",attractions,5.0,4.5
Absolutely amazing!,"Make sure to get the combo ticket so you can see all of the sights around the Acropolis. It's easy to walk around, but there is a bit of a climb which isn't too bad.

"Great location, comfort, and price","This place was a great price and it makes you feel like you're in a nice resort.

A relaxing and historical ride,"The Thai-Burma Railway is a must do experience in Kanchanaburi. The ride is generally pleasant. While there isn't any air conditioning, the windows are always down allowing for a cool breeze to enter and the tickets are cheap (100 baht). The train takes you along the famous Bridge on the River Kwai and along the steep cliff next to the river. The sights are gorgeous and will take your breath away. At the end of the railroad, you can easily walk or get a truck over to Hellsfire Pass to continue the historical adventure.",August 2018,Burma-Thai Railway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297924-d1731130-Reviews-Burma_Thai_Railway-Kanchanaburi_Kanchanaburi_Province.html,"Kanchanaburi, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.5
Hidden hostel in a great location,"This hostel is located near the square and a great scooter rental. When we got here, were were able to safely leave our bags until check in. They was friendly and accommodation.

As for the rooms, they were decently kept. The beds were hard and you're given a little blanket and a pillow. The room we checked into didn't have air con, but there were two fans that we all used.

Fun for all ages,"Fossil Rim Wildlife Center is a unique experience located in the hill country of Texas. I've lived on the back road of this place growing up, and it was always a treat to go to the center. Everywhere you look there are flowing hills, trees, and a great scenery.

Before driving through the park, you can grab some pellets to feed the animals. Along the route, you're able to stop and feed them. Some are so eager that they'll poke their head through the window. It's a great experience that gets you up close to the animals unlike anything in a zoo.

Halfway through the adventure, there's an overlook where you can grab some food for yourself, shop a little, and see the kid's zone. Feel free to pet the goats and lamb!

I had fun as a kid going through this park, and I recently just went again with my best friend. It was a great experience; especially during the spring when everything is in bloom and the babies are out.",April 2018,Fossil Rim Wildlife Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g55902-d107468-Reviews-Fossil_Rim_Wildlife_Center-Glen_Rose_Texas.html,"Glen Rose, Texas",attractions,4.0,4.5
Giant pizza slices and great beer!,"This pizza joint in downtown Georgetown is great for grabbing a bite to eat. I love taking friends and family here. It has a northern pub vibe with the southern hospitality.

There's always a wide selection of beer which constantly changes, so each time you go in you never know what they'll have. If you're unsure as to which beer you'll love they can sometimes give you a sample.

As for the pizza, it's amazing! Before 5 pm, you can order a slice of their signature pizzas instead of having to buy the whole pizza. After 5 pm, you'll only be able to get cheese or pepperoni pizza in slices. One slice is a good meal, because they're about the size of your head. If you want a whole pizza, you can go for that as well. Besides pizza, they do have some good salads and wings.

Depending on what you get, this can be a fairly cheap place to eat or about moderate in price. If you're looking for cheap, get a slice of the cheese or pepperoni pizza and a beer.",June 2017,600 Degrees Pizzeria & Drafthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55892-d6788609-Reviews-600_Degrees_Pizzeria_Drafthouse-Georgetown_Texas.html,"Georgetown, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Amazing doughnuts and great atmosphere!,"This place is good to head to after a night of drinking on sixth street or a day of walking in downtown Austin. This place has an eccentric vibe which even extends to their donuts. The voodoo doughnut is great with a chocolate glaze on top and raspberry filling. There are other donuts such as ones covered in oreos, peanut butter, marshmallows, and even cereal. It's sometimes hard to choose which doughnut to try first, so when you get up to order just point at the one you want. This place only takes cash, so make sure to have some on hand before you go in.",May 2017,Voodoo Doughnuts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g30196-d8731641-Reviews-Voodoo_Doughnuts-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great food with a WWII theme!,"The WWII theme is found everywhere you look here. From the names of the drinks and foods to the decorations on the walls, there's not a place where you don't think of history. The drinks here are a tasty treat and pair nicely with the food. It's good old fashioned American style and great for a night out. While they area bit pricey, it's good to hit up at least once. The waitresses are dressed a bit skimpy like Hooters, but most of them are really nice. One downfall I found on my last visit was that they seemed to be a bit ditzier than normal. It took a bit longer to figure out who was working our table and when they needed to check on us. Besides that, it was a great experience.",May 2017,Bombshells Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56451-d10490564-Reviews-Bombshells_Restaurant-Pflugerville_Texas.html,"Pflugerville, Texas",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Make sure to book a tour because the history is fascinating!,"These ancient ruins sit alongside one of the most gorgeous beaches. The temples in the area are not as large as those in Coba, but they are magnificent. You'll learn about the Maya culture, rituals, and some of the sacrifices they made. Make sure to check out the beach. The area is a favorite with the sea turtles who come to lay their eggs year after year.

It's a good idea to bring lots of water with you and make sure to have pesos. The people in the area are majorly Mayas, so they have no use for American dollars. Another thing to note, is that the people walking around in feathered costumes charge you money if you take a photo with them. They will sometimes trick people into taking the photo first and then demanding the money.

At the entrance there are also unique trinkets to buy and things to try. Make sure to try a fresh coconut. They taste amazing!

Some things you might see around the area are iguanas. While these creatures are friendly, make sure to only feed them fresh fruit. If you feed them anything else, they have a high chance of exploding. Yes, I thought this was a lie, but one of the tour guides had witnessed it first hand.",April 2017,Tulum Archaeological Site,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150813-d153186-Reviews-Tulum_Archaeological_Site-Tulum_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Tulum, Mexico",attractions,5.0,4.5
Last year to climb the ruins!,"This is a great day trip to experience the ancient ruins and Maya culture. Trek around the park to view all the various pyramids and climb up to the top of Nohoch Mol. It consists of 120 slippery steps for an amazing view of the area. At the top you'll be able to see the pyramids poking through the trees. It's something that will make you begin to understand why the Ancient Mayas believed they would be closer to heaven by building these architectural pieces. On the way down, make sure to hold on to the rope and slide on your butt if you have to. Believe me, that's what I did. It doesn't look too high, but once you make your way up you might find a new fear of heights, but it's worth the experience.

With the days being hot, it can sometimes get too much to walk everywhere. The park provides bike rentals at the beginning and main temple should you decide to take that up. They will stop at the various pyramids along the way if you ask them to.",April 2017,Zona Arqueológica de Cobá,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g499447-d152724-Reviews-Zona_Arqueologica_de_Coba-Coba_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Coba, Mexico",attractions,5.0,4.5
Unique specials and great food!,"Each day they have a different special. This past weekend, a friend and I went to check out this place. We got some of the specials which were large slices of pizza of margarita, eggplant, cheese, or pepperoni. We decided to get the margarita and eggplant. To be honest, I was skeptical about the eggplant. How good would that really be on pizza? Surprisingly, it was great! They know how to make their pizza and it's got that great New York style.

The restaurant has an old 80's vibe. You can either sit down at a table or check out the bar so you can watch the workers toss the dough. If pizza isn't your thing, there's also selections of salads and other items.

This is a great place to go, but make sure to get there early to beat the 5 o'clock crowd!",May 2017,Home Slice Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g30196-d781751-Reviews-Home_Slice_Pizza-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.5

While this is a great place, it's not so great on a hot day with all the sugar in these sweet treats.

Some of the favorites are the BBQ and fried shrimp. Yes, the prices are a bit high, but you get your moneys worth. The food is packed onto each plate and often times it's bigger than your head.

There are several layers to the place which can be quite steep to climb up to, so be careful when walking around. On select days, there is a truck where you can purchase photos of previous artwork seen on the grounds. Since the artwork changes every day, what you see one day might not be there the next. If you want, you can bring your own spray can and contribute to the walls! Austin prides itself on this wall and aims to create an artistic outlet for people.

Okay College Bar,"Upon entering, you can tell the workers don't want to be here. This is your typical college bar located on the UT campus. The place can get busy, but for the most part it's very laid back. They have an outside area where you can bring your dog, but you have to make sure it's on a leash. This is a good place to get drinks if you don't mind having to go up to the bar for each one. I will admit that the drinks were good. The whiskey sours were on point! Another great perk is that it's located near several other bars and Pluckers, where you can get some tasty wings.",April 2017,Cain & Abel’s,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g30196-d4192171-Reviews-Cain_Abel_s-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",restaurants,3.0,3.5

"Pina Coladas, Monkeys, and the Beach","Situated amidst the jungle and alongside the beach, Fairmont Mayakoba is a great hotel in the Riviera Maya. From its close proximity to attractions to the numerous pools, this hotel has something for everyone.

The resort prides itself on having 5 pools, a lagoon, and a beach where you can lay at your leisure while you drink a Pina Colada. Believe me, I spent a couple hours on the beach with the Pina Coladas. They've also got some games for the kids to play such as soccer or volley ball. If the wind isn't too bad, you can also rent boogie boards and go out for a fun ride.

After a long day on the beach there's nothing like getting a good meal. There are three restaurants to choose from as well as a dine-in menu. You can choose either Italian, Mexican, or an Asian Mix. I do have to say that while this food is great, it is very heavy so take it easy and don't over do it. In the mornings they also serve a continental breakfast which is included in your stay. They have an array of buffet selections from freshly made omelets to crepes and cinnamon buns. Make sure to get there early, because the rush hits about 9 am.  

You'll find that it's easy to relax here, especially in the hotel room. These rooms have feathered pillows and comfortable beds. Most have a balcony where you can relax covered among the jungle foliage. Here you can see an array of birds or even a monkey, but don't feed them because they can get quite aggressive. You can also see iguanas throughout the place. The area makes sure not to kill them and asks that you do not touch them. They can most be seen in between the bushes or walking across the walkways. Another perk to the hotel is that the water is filtered twice. This is great when you're in the Yucatan area, because the local water is unfiltered and numerous people swim in the cenotes that are part of the source. The hotel makes sure that you have several bottles of water in your room and when you leave to go on an excursion they offer even more.

The staff is friendly for the most part. I found that the men were quite amiable, but the women were very distant and slightly rude at times. Overall, they did a wonderful job. They aim to make your experience the best it can be. If you want to do an activity, but haven't looked into it they will research it for you and send you the information. Yes, that's quite different, but sometimes they can find great deals for you! 

While the resort itself is amazing, it's also in a great area to reach other attractions. From here, you can easily go to Playa del Carmen, Cancun, the Tulum ruins, or even Coba. The Akumal Monkey Sanctuary is worth a visit when in the area. 

Overall, this resort is a great place to relax, but make sure you set money aside for this luxurious stay. They charge a lot of extra fees and taxes when you arrive at the hotel. Though, it is a bit pricey it's well worth it!",April 2017,Fairmont Mayakoba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150812-d574376-Reviews-Fairmont_Mayakoba-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",hotels,4.0,4.5
