Great Business Stay!!!,"We travelled to the Boma for 3 nights from 15th to 18th December 2020 on business and highly recommend this hotel when on business in Eldoret. The pricing was also very good and value-for-money in our view.

We got a room upgrade on arrival considering that the hotel was not full and this enhanced the quality of our stay. It was truly a comfortable room.

The meals were good and of decent quantity especially the sizzling fillet steak which was the highlight of our stay.

The hotel has a pool though we never used it and the parking was very secure. Boma is located in a very quiet neighbourhood which added to the relaxation after a hard days work.

The hotel is also dealing with COVID-19 very well with temperature checks on entry, sign-in for contact tracing, sanitisers everywhere, use of masks and minimal contact with staff and other guests in the common areas.

Highly recommended to future guests to Eldoret.",December 2020,Boma Inn Eldoret,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g681265-d4718849-Reviews-Boma_Inn_Eldoret-Eldoret_Rift_Valley_Province.html,"Eldoret, Kenya",hotels,5.0,4.5
Enjoyable Stay at Melia over the Xmas and New Year festive period,"My wife and I stayed at Melia for 11 nights over the festive period from 23rd December 2020 to 3rd January 2021. We stayed in Room 1407 all-inclusive which had a great terrace and partial ocean view and it was magnificent. Overall, we highly recommend this resort to all seeking a refreshing, relaxed and enjoyable vacation. It is a big resort with numerous activities across the main resort and the beach area and we never felt bored at any point so kudos to the entire team of management and staff.

To the specifics of what made our stay memorable:
+ All the food was spectacular with themed dinners almost every night
+ The pool area was never felt crowded though the resort was full on all the days. The pool service was swift in serving drinks and the pool swim was refreshing. There were always available beds to relax.
+ The Jetty was an experience in itself and we enjoyed numerous lunches there. We even enjoyed a DJ mix one evening after dinner when the management arranged for a dance for the guests.
+ Gabi Beach is spectacular. The resort arranges for golf cart transfer from the main reception to the beach every few minutes. We even walked on 2 occasions. Once through the garden and once through the beach. All enjoyable. There are enough beach beds at Gabi as well with swift food and drinks service which further relaxed our holiday.
+ Both management and staff are really an asset to the resort. You always see the management walking around ensuring the guest experience is top-notch and the staff always serving with a smile. We would specifically single out the following for recognition - Daniel, Flothea, Musa, Said and Msanifu - they made our stay epic. I would also like to mention one of the managers who is a staunch Barca supporter who gave me a bear hug when he saw me wearing a Barcelona cap on New Years Day.
+ We also did the couples massage at the Spa. This was one of the highlights of our stay and added to our relaxation and enjoyment of the Resort.
+ The Christmas and New Year Eve parties were simply EPIC!!!
+ I would like to mention that in instances where you are not satisfied with anything at the resort, the staff and management make genuine effort to rectify it to ensure your vacation remains enjoyable. We had 2 major issues on 30th December 2020 and we reported them to the management and these were resolved immediately. I encourage guests to report issues first to management for resolution while still at the hotel rather than wait for the end of their vacation and write poor reviews.

Overall, this was a magnificent stay for us and we hopefully will return in the future.",January 2021,Melia Zanzibar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616018-d585857-Reviews-Melia_Zanzibar-Kiwengwa_Zanzibar_Island_Zanzibar_Archipelago.html,"Zanzibar Island, Tanzania",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Great Christmas Day lunch, entertainment and service!!!","My family and I took the 3.5 hour drive from Nairobi to the Mount Kenya Safari Club for Christmas Day lunch, entertainment, service and relaxation for the day and we were not disappointed.

Our reception at the main gate, entrance and reception were very friendly and smooth. We had made the lunch reservation a week earlier and everyone was expecting our arrival.

We were ushered to our table and we enjoyed the various courses of our meal and the accompanying drinks. The food was quite tasty and fresh. There was also a great live band which serenaded the food and drink down our throats.

We then retreated to the grounds for a walk passing through the little church, the fishing pond and the maze and ending up at the pool area for afternoon relaxation and chatting with family. The views of Mount Kenya were also quite good from the hotel on a warm and sunny Christmas Day.

This was indeed a fantastic way to spend our Christmas Day. Well done to the hotel team for hosting us and looking forward to returning in the future for a longer stay and some golf. Highly recommended.",December 2019,Fairmont Mount Kenya Safari Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g612348-d302825-Reviews-Fairmont_Mount_Kenya_Safari_Club-Nanyuki_Town_Nanyuki_Municipality_Laikipia_County_Rift.html,"Nanyuki Town, Kenya",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Convenient, affordable and easy to use!","My wife and i visited Athens in September 2019 and found the Athens Metro quite convenient, affordable and easy to use as compared to the taxis and buses. The Metro passes most of the areas of interest including Syntagma, Acropolis, Flea Market etc and our Evangelismos stop was a 5-minute walk from our hotel in Kolonaki. Very convenient.

The ticket machines are also very easy to use and understand. We varied our tickets depending on what we wanted to do for the day. On one day, we took the 24-hour tcket, on another day we used the 2 trips option and on the final day, we booked the Athens to Airport tickets. Very easy to use and quite affordable. On one day, we used it to go to McArther Glen Shopping Store. It stopped at Doukissis Plakentias and then we went by bus 319 to the store.

On one day, the station police who were showing us directions to the places we wanted to visit advised us to be very careful of thieves and pick-pockets so we were always very cautious and careful on our metro rides. No incidents.

Highly recommended.",September 2019,Attiko Metro S.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d7759649-Reviews-Attiko_Metro_S_A-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.5
Fantastic vibe and great food,"My wife and i visited Santorini for 5 nights between 17th and 22nd September 2019. We stumbled upon Apollon Restaurant during an evening walk and we liked the enthusiasm of the staff team who encouraged us to come in and give it a try (and the place was full of diners at the time which gave us a good vibe about the place). They were really bemused as they had never met people from Kenya before and they took a real interest to find out about us and our country.

The service was attentive and fun and the food was even better. We ended up eating here twice more during our stay and we enjoyed every minute of the experience.

Highly recommended.",September 2019,Apollon Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635608-d4570870-Reviews-Apollon_Restaurant-Perissa_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice beach (but we have seen and swam in much better back home)!!!,"The Perivolos Beach was a 2-minute walk from the hotel we were staying in mid-September 2019 so we obviously spent a decent amount of time at the beach and the restaurants near the beach. Its got black sand which is not the very best to walk on and the Aegean Sea was extremely cold for a swim though we swam twice.

The beach vibe is nice but we have much more world-class beaches back home in Kenya - Diani, Watamu, Lamu, Malindi etc - which are pure white powder sand beaches. For my wife and I, it was nice and different though.

Worth a visit though (including Kamari Beach) for the black sand experience when you visit Santorini",September 2019,Perivolos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g657830-d6988148-Reviews-Perivolos_Beach-Perivolos_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Number 1 thing to do in Santorini!!!,"My wife and I enjoy long nature walks and it was obvious that we were looking forward to this hike when we visited Santorini. So we set off from our hotel by bus to the Fira Central Station at about 9.00am on 18th September 2019.

We then strolled to Firostefani for about 15 minutes to the start of the hike. Our first sight of the caldera was mind-boggling. You can never get tired of this view. We took so many pictures at the starting point.

We had read many reviews about the need to have proper shoes and drinking water and snacks and we came prepared.

The walk is really beautiful taking pictures every few metres and passing many hotels, houses, churches, restaurants and going up and down on smooth pavement and rough terrain. All this while enjoying the magnificent view of the caldera.

This is one of the best things we have ever done - and its free!!! When you plan to visit Oia from other parts of the island, we advise that you hike it there instead of taking the bus. We completed the hike in about 3 hours with many photo stops.

Please note that the section between Imerovigli and Oia can be very challenging if you are not fit - loose rocks, paths along the cliff edge, steep climbs and descents etc so you need to be very confident about your physical ability to complete the second half of this hike.

But we really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.",September 2019,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d2368798-Reviews-Hiking_Trail_Fira_Oia-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
World Tourism Weekend Suprise!!!,"We arrived in Athens in the afternoon on 27th September 2019 from Mykonos and upon arriving at our hotel, they alerted us that its World Tourism weekend and we could enjoy the Acropolis + Museum Tour for FREE. What a surprise.

So we took the Metro to the Acropolis and got free tickets to enjoy the marvel of the Acropolis and also soak in the depth of Greek history at the Museum below.

Its a great tour and recommended to all visitors to Athens though its advisable to have proper shoes as it is quite steep and slippery in some sections.",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Delightful Hotel at the heart of Kolonaki!!!,"My wife and I visited this hotel on 16th September 2019 (before heading off to Santorini and Mykonos) and then on 27th to 29th September 2019 prior to our departure from Greece back to Kenya.

This is a beautiful hotel at the heart of Kolonaki with the basement and ground floor being a bedroom accessories shop and the six floors above it forming the hotel itself.

The main highlights of our stay were as follows:

1. The staff are very friendly, not intrusive and willing to help and show you the best places to visit. Our highlight was the Acropolis tour and the Monastiraki Square.
2. We got our room upgraded on both visits from a basic Sleep Tight room to balcony rooms facing the street. We really appreciated this gesture.
3. The views from the 7th floor terrace are breath-taking. You can enjoy the Acropolis while you relax on the terrace.
4. The BIGGEST BONUS for us for this hotel was access to the Metro which is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel. You can access the whole of Athens area using the Metro including the airport so its location is very conducive to moving around the city affordably. Taxis in Athens are very expensive above EUR 40 per trip.
5. The food was nice - we ate all our breakfasts at the hotel and they had a decent mix of hot and cold options which was great.
6. There is a nearby Deli for buying water, soft drinks and food in case you need a snack. We also appreciated the FREE MINIBAR in the rooms during our stay. There are a number of restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood which also play loud music till late but they did not ruin our visit.
7. We also walked to Ermou Street (main shopping street in Athens) and Monastiraki Square on one of the days and it took us about 20 minutes on foot so the location is great. We also used the Metro + Bus 319 to MacArthur Glen Store for shopping prior to departing Athens and it was quite convenient from the hotel (though very far).
8. We wanted to specifically comment on the beds. They are VERY GOOD with beautiful sleep quality if you are spending the night after a long flight. This was also a highlight of our visit to Coco Mat Athens Hotel.

Overall, we enjoyed our trip and have already recommended the hotel to our friends in Kenya and Africa to try out during their visits to Athens.

Well done to the Coco Mat Athens Hotel Team!!!",September 2019,Coco-Mat Hotel Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d9762205-Reviews-Coco_Mat_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great hotel and base to explore Santorini,"My wife and i stayed at this hotel for 5 nights from 17th to 22nd September 2019 (first Kenyans to stay in Smaragdi). We stayed in Room 15 (Luxury Room) and enjoyed our stayed and recommend it to guests visiting Santorini. The hotel has many highlights which i will summarise below but i wish to advise that Santorini is a very small island and you can access all of Santorini affordably by bus (for about EUR 4.20 which is EUR 2.40 to Fira town and EUR 1.80 to other places including Oia). The hotel is near a bus stop called Euro Market from where you can go anywhere on the island. We enjoyed exploring Santorini by bus and also by boat which is available on the beach 2 minutes away.

Now for the summary of the hotel stay:
1. Great location within a 2 minutes walk to Perivolos Beach (black sand beach)
2. Near the Euro Market bus stop where you can travel to the entire island by bus. We went to Fira, Imerovigli, Firostefani, Pyrgos, Kamari among many other places by bus very affordably. Taxis can be very costly in Santorini (approximately EUR 35). Instead of paying thousands of Euros in staying in Oia and the other Caldera towns, its more affordable to stay at Smaragdi which is very spacious - Oia hotels are small and quite crammed.
3. Delightful room. We stayed in a luxury room #15 with external jacuzzi. The jacuzzi was heavenly after our daily excursions and especially on the day we did the Fira to Oia hike. Coming back to the hotel and soaking in the jacuzzi was a highlight.
4. The hotel has a good breakfast spread with a good mix of hot and cold options and cold juices.
5. The nearby Perivolos beach and promenade all the way to Perissa has a nice mix of restaurants and bars with nice beach beds and music for relaxation though a good number of them charge for the beds. A note to future guests is that at the very end of the promenade next to the mountain, there is a EUR 5 boat that can take you round the mountain to Kamari beach in 20 minutes. Try it out!
6. The staff at Smaragdi are very friendly, nice and always willing to help especially in advising on nice places to visit. They always have a 7.00pm briefing to guests on areas to explore so that guests can select which excursions they would like to do. The staff are very hardworking as well in keeping the rooms clean, fresh and spotless.

The hotel remains 5-STARS though one area of improvement would be to heat the pool to improve the guest experience. We lounged on the pool beds but rarely swam because the pool water was extremely cold and we could not stay in for long. Surprisingly, the pool would be very cold even when the sun was very hot - even our swim in the Aegean Sea, the water was extremely cold.

Otherwise, well done to the Smaragdi team and we have already recommended the hotel to our friends in Kenya and Africa for their next visits to Santorini.",September 2019,Smaragdi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635608-d607385-Reviews-Smaragdi-Perissa_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Our New Mykonian Home!!!,"My wife and i stayed her for 5 nights from 22nd to 27th September 2019 (first Kenyans to stay at Damianos) and we concluded that this would be our new home whenever we shall return to Mykonos.

I will summarise our highlights because they have been said by other reviewers before:

1. The views from the hotel across the Aegean Sea are simply breath-taking. You can never get tired of that view.
2. Quick downhill 5-minute walk into town (and an uphill climb back up of less than 10 minutes - we actually enjoy the hike back up)
3. The staff are genuine and authentic. Mrs. Hellen, Thanos, Georgia and the team are genuinely happy to make your stay as pleasant as possible. This is the #1 asset to this property. Keep it up guys - you made our stay memorable.
4. Thanos came for us from the ferry when we arrived and Mrs. Hellen dropped us back at the port for our departure. We really appreciated these drop-offs. These guys run an extremely efficient operation to provide exemplary to their guests. Sometimes, you wonder how they pull this off but well-done to the team.
5. We had all our breakfasts at the hotel and it was a good spread of hot and cold options. We also dined twice at the hotel and the food was really tasty and fresh. Especially the Moussaka. Highly recommended.
6. We made some good friends at the hotel (from Australia and New Zealand) and they also enjoyed their stay at the hotel which is testament as to how great the property is.
7. We stayed at Room 22 which was of good size with adequate amenities including TV, safe, nice-sized bath and just enough distance away from the common areas for some quiet time.
8. The bus to Elia beach passes right outside the hotel. We used it to go to the beach on one of the days and it was very convenient for us. Damianos Hotel is well located next to Chora Town (Mykonos capital) and not too far from the port as well.

Our overall assessment of our stay remains at 5-STARS though there are 2 areas that the Damianos team can consider going forward:
1. The pool was quite cold (though this applies to the Aegean Sea as well where we swam and the water was very cold) - a future consideration could be to heat the pool for a better guest experience.
2. Some of the tour groups staying at the hotel when we were there could be quite overwhelming especially after having a few drinks. The good thing though was that they were always out of the hotel either on an excursion or at night partying so they did not diminish our holiday in any way though they might have affected other guests.

Otherwise, we have already recommended Damianos to a few of our friends and colleagues from Kenya and Africa when they are coming over to Mykonos.

Well done Damianos!!!",September 2019,Damianos Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g662620-d581183-Reviews-Damianos_Hotel-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Perfect place to chill, relax and recharge!!!","My wife and I visited this resort for 5 nights from 29th December 2018 to 3rd January 2019 for the New Year Break and festivities. We literally loved everything about the place - the location, food, room, beach, and most importantly, the staff.

The hotel is located in a serene and quiet setting along the beach and conducive for long walks on the beach in the early morning or late evening once the heat subsides. We wanted to chill, relax and recharge after a long, hard year and lazing on the beach beds with the staff attending to all our needs was heavenly.

The food was extremely delicious. We were on full-board and had enough variety to sample almost the entire menu. The unique aspect about food at the Maji is that it is served at the guests preferred timing so you can have extremely late breakfasts or early lunches as per your preference - we found this pretty cool as compared to the timed meal slots at the larger hotels elsewhere.

The room was great with a nice garden view with balcony, nice bath and combined A/C or fan depending on your preference - we understand there are 15 rooms in total which is quite small and intimate and the hotel is also adults-only for maximum calm. We were in Room 11 (Ziwa Room). We enjoyed our daily swims in the hotel pool which was part of our cooling down ritual from the extreme heat which hit 30 degrees on some days.

We also swam in the ocean on all the days we were at the Maji which was great fun and was one of the highlights of our trip.

The hotel was also quite accommodating and allowed our 2 sisters who were staying in a nearby hotel in Diani to visit and swim, chat, drink and dine with us on 2 separate occasions. This made our stay even more memorable.

FINALLY. The single aspect that makes this hotel worth your penny is the staff. We were treated like royalty throughout our stay from the beach beds, security, swimming pool, guest relations, rooms - literally everywhere. We would single out John and the 2 Zippy's for special mention but this accolade extends to ALL THE STAFF and the ENTIRE TEAM at Maji Resort.

For these reasons, we will be regular return visitors to Maji going forward and recommend to all who are planning to visit Diani!!!",January 2019,The Maji Beach Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g775870-d5011973-Reviews-The_Maji_Beach_Boutique_Hotel-Diani_Beach_Ukunda_Coast_Province.html,"Diani Beach, Kenya",hotels,5.0,5.0

We got 2 seats overlooking the beach and what a fantastic view it was. It was a perfect view over the ocean watching people swimming, the dhows sailing and various water activities and beach football. It was just amazing.

Wonderful Stay - We Will Return!!!,"My wife and I visited this resort for 5 nights from 24th to 29 December 2018 for the Christmas festivities. We literally loved everything about the place - the location, food, room, beach, boat rides, and most importantly, the staff.

The location on Manda island is serene and quite and conducive for long walks on the beach in the early morning or late evening once the heat subsides. And the views of the sunsets were exquisite from the hotel.

The food was extremely delicious. We were on full-board and had enough variety to sample almost the entire menu. We highly recommend the seafood risotto.

The room was extremely huge with Swahili touches all around - we understand there are 27 rooms in total which is quite small and intimate. We were in Room 20 with a pool right at our doorstep. We enjoyed our daily swims which was part of our cooling down ritual from the extreme heat which hit 31 degrees on some days.

We also swam in the beach on some days while watching some of the water sports at the from of the hotel such as kayaking, surfboarding, etc which was great fun.

We also took boat rides from the resort to Lamu island and also Shela Beach (this beach is heavenly and can be viewed from Majlis Resort across the bay) and the boat rides were also the highlight of our visit.

Great new hotel in Hargeisa,"I stayed here for 2 nights on business between 20th and 22nd March 2018 as my base for meetings with government officials. It is housed within a secure compound with very tall perimeter walls and armed security at the entrance with detailed scanner and body checks every time you come back to the hotel after work which was quite reassuring.

The check-in and check-out processes were fairly straight forward though there is still room for improvement in terms of final payment processes.

Its a great new addition to the Hargeisa hotel industry with decent security and lively grounds full of vegetation and flowers and open outdoor spaces to sit and relax after a hard days work. The wait staff are well mannered though a bit slow with room for improvement.

The rooms are very well appointed with the only drawbacks being the few channels on TV and also the hot shower system which seemed very erratic and unpredictable. The other amenities including the soft bed and 2 daily water bottles were a good bonus.

The Wi-Fi was generally good and conducive to work for long periods without significant interruptions.

Overall, its a good hotel and i will stay here ne next time i return to Hargeisa.",March 2018,Ali Jirde Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482880-d12416153-Reviews-Ali_Jirde_Hotel-Hargeysa_Somaliland.html,"Hargeysa, Somalia",hotels,4.0,4.0

On this day, there were lots of tourists but did not feel crowded. The Fort has a panoramic view of Port Louis and you can also see the old race track below. Its gives good views for photos with the backdrop of the city, mountains and the harbor.

There is also a small souvenir shop with an enthusiastic owner and we bought nice hats for ourselves at the shop.

It has great scenery and is very green and has a 400 metre jogging track around the crater which was a nice touch. The weather was good on the day of our visit so we could take pictures of the crater and further along the track, you can take pictures with a backdrop of Port Louis which was fun.

There were few people during our visit but considering the limited viewing points, can get chaotic if a large group arrives.

Truly a wonderful Resort & Spa!!!,"My wife and I spent 14 nights at this Resort half-board for the Christmas and New Year Break from 23rd December 2017 to 06 January 2018.

Our sole objective for this holiday was to relax and recharge our batteries in readiness for our big plans for 2018 and this hotel was truly a wonderful choice for us. A point to note is that the hotel is adult-only and very compact with everything within a 3-5 minute walk from your room which was perfect - we did not want a hotel which is spread out over vast real estate where walking to the pool, dining or beach would take an unnecessarily long time. It was also very quiet which made for a relaxing holiday. This was the perfect hotel for us.

Straight to the point - the biggest asset for this hotel is its incredible staff. The hotel has assembled an unbelievable team of staff to take care of its guests in all areas - from the gate, reception, concierge, house-keeping, dining, Aqua restaurant, pool, beach - and all other places. They all just serve with genuine commitment to make your stay as comfortable as possible. During this festive period, we noticed a combination of old, new and intern staff all coordinating quite well to provide the best service to the guests. We even interacted with some Kenyans who were part of the staff which was refreshing.

We were on an ocean facing room (3211) which was of good size, cleaned spotlessly everyday and with all amenities of a modern hotel (Smart TV, safe, coffee maker, water-heater, functional bath-no tub though not needed) and a breathtaking view every morning waking up to a view of the blue ocean and palm trees under the Mauritian sun. Heavenly.

The breakfast spread was excellent with good hot and cold options and accompanying juices and drinks which sufficed for us through the day to dinner time. The dining varieties were also good with themed nights for the week which was also good for us.

The pool and beach are just in front of the hotel and we spent many our days lounging on the deck and in the pool and this could only be summarized in 1 word: Paradise. The pool water was warm and we could not leave the pool most days and we thoroughly enjoyed the volleyball or just soaking up the whole day. We also ventured out to the ocean on some days which was equally fun though the ocean floor is rocky so you need to wear some protective gear on your feet before entering the ocean otherwise you could get hurt.

There was live and DJ entertainment every night till around midnight which created some nightlife during this festive period which we really enjoyed in the spirit of Christmas and the New Year. And the New Years Eve midnight entertainment and fireworks display was spectacular. It was really close-up and went on for 10-15 minutes and was a fun way of ushering the New Year. Well done to the entertainment team for this show. And this was after some sumptuous New Years Eve dinner at the main restaurant. The hotel pulled out all the stops to usher in 2018 for its guests.

We were also able to go on various excursions privately (North, South and Ile Aux Cerfs) and through the hotel (Grand Baie) and it was easy to coordinate and enjoy the rest of the island. We also took a day trip to the sister Azuri hotel nearby and enjoyed the free activities there especially the glass boat and the Platform swim (taken to the lagoon by speed boat). Do not miss to visit Azuri on at least one day of your visit - you won't regret it.

On our second week, a cyclone hit Mauritus and everywhere you went on the island, there was heavy rain and very strong wind which somehow dampened the holiday mood but the hotel tried to entertain its guests as much as they could in the dining area, reception and at the restaurant to keep the festive spirit up. We really sympathized with the new guests who never got to enjoy the Mauritian sunshine and swim but there was nothing the hotel could have done about the weather. But they did their best to entertain.

On 2.5 days also, I got a strong fever and had to stay in our room on medication and the reception team kept checking up on me to confirm that I was recovering well and brought up water and extra duvets on request which I felt was a nice touch. My condition improved significantly towards the end of our stay and I was able to enjoy the last few days of our holiday.

Our trip was so good my wife is contemplating settling permanently in Mauritius all thanks to the Radisson Blu. Well done to the entire team and keep up the good work.

PS - Sunil Concierge is such as sport. I used to call him the Happy Solutions Guy. He supported us (with a smile) on the excursions and also on our last day as we were planning our departure. The whole team deserves kudos and when we return to Mauritius, we know where to stay.",January 2018,"Radisson Blu Poste Lafayette Resort & Spa, Mauritius",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1182893-d3584998-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Poste_Lafayette_Resort_Spa_Mauritius-Poste_Lafayette.html,Mauritius,hotels,5.0,5.0
Must have been paradise before the crowds came calling!!!!,"My wife and I visited this island via speed boat on 31st December 2017. We walked to the other side of the island and found a beautiful spot and enjoyed our afternoon swim on the turquoise blue ocean waters some distance from the shore.

The area where we settled was sandwiched between the parked boats and catamarans on one side and then wild water activities (parasailing, banana tube rides etc) on the other side. And the whole island was packed with people from all walks of life. There were a few restaurants from where we bought some expensive soft drinks and these were also completely packed.

When you read the earlier reviews about Ile Aux Cerf, you wonder how beautiful the island must have been before the tourists and people came calling.

We enjoyed our 4 hours on the island and trooped back to the jetty where many catamarans and speed boats were waiting for their parties to get back to the mainland. This was a unique bucket-list experience for us but not sure we would venture out again. Probably to the other less popular islands.",December 2017,Ile aux Cerfs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293816-d477276-Reviews-Ile_aux_Cerfs-Mauritius.html,Mauritius,attractions,4.0,4.0
Great Kenyan Dishes!!!,"We visited this restaurant as a group on friends on a Sunday afternoon (26th November 2017) and enjoyed our roasted chicken and fried fish prepared in authentic Western Kenya style. The food was delicious all round with tasty ugali and vegetable options.

Two areas for improvement would be brightening up the seating area as it was quite dark for a sunny Sunday afternoon and also the queues to the washrooms were funnily long.

Otherwise, if you have an appetite for local Kenyan food, this is the place to visit. We will return for sure.",November 2017,Three Dee Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294207-d12721223-Reviews-Three_Dee_Restaurant-Nairobi.html,"Nairobi, Kenya",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Nice little hotel in convenient location with great staff,"My wife and I hosted my mum-in-law in a single room at this hotel for 4 nights from 8th to 12th October 2017 (we stayed at another hotel nearby).

She got a nice little room on the first floor with all the amenities she needed (comfortable bed, nice little bathroom etc) and she really enjoyed the breakfast and the facilities. We got quite a bargain for her stay and we glad we chose this hotel.

The staff at the reception were great and they shared with us a number of things we could do together during our visit to Barcelona. Like our neighbouring hotel, this hotel is conveniently located close to many attractions on foot including Las Ramblas, Placa Catalunya and the harbor which are all within a 25 minute walk. There are also plenty of restaurants nearby for fantastic dining options.

The place is relatively small and tends to get quite packed so reservations are a must if you want to enjoy this fondue heaven. We will never forget this experience!

Scenic Basilica,"My wife and I visited this majestic Basilica on 15th October 2017 and it was a marvel both inside and outside. The views across Paris from the hill were fantastic.

On this day, there was a festival right outside the church so the crowds were really huge. Its not to be missed when on a tour of Paris.

Remember the Basilica is on top on Montmarte so there is quite an upward walk/ climb to the top but once you are up there, you will not regret it.

Wonderful visit,"My wife and I visited this beautiful monastery on the 10th October 2017 and it was generally a great experience. Caught the train from Placa Catalunya on a return combined train-funicular ticket and arrived at Monistrol at 11.00am. The ride up on the train was spectacular which brings you to the monastery itself. As mentioned by other reviewers, its quite touristy but you take time to pray and appreciate the history of the place. We missed both the choir and the mass but we were still glad we were there.

Then we took the funicular ride to up the mountain and this was quite exciting. There are several walking tracks up there and we were lucky that we were there on a bright sunny day with clear blue skies which made the experience worthwhile. We took beautiful photos up the mountain.

Its a good place to visit and not too expensive to get there.

What are you waiting for? Go for it!!!,"My wife and I stayed at Olivia Balmes Hotel for 4 nights from 7th to 11th October 2017 and we had such a blast. It was our first time in Barcelona and we were very happy to stay at this hotel. The highlight of our stay was a birthday breakfast surprise on 10th October just as we were about to leave for our daily escapades. Glass of wine, cake, birthday song - quite charming.

The check-in and check-out service was super fast. The reception staff were also quite helpful with ideas on where to explore putting in mind that there were massive protests going on across the city at the time of our visit. Barcelona is really beautiful and we enjoyed every minute of our stay at this city.

The room was great and the bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel is quite modern and everything worked well during our stay. The breakfast was quite enjoyable as well.

The convenience of the hotel location is one of its greatest assets. Its about 10 minutes walk to Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas and probably about 25 minutes walk to the port area. Its also about 5 minutes to the nearest HOHO bus stop and is close to very many restaurants for your dining options. The location was very convenient for us and we accessed a good number of the attractions on foot (we love long walks). Its also 10 minutes by taxi to Placa Espanya from where we caught the train to Montserrat.

We enjoyed our trip to Barcelona and was made possible by our choice of Olivia Balmes Hotel and would highly recommend - we believe we got maximum value for our money. We will stay here in our next trip to this beautiful city.",October 2017,Olivia Balmes Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d4569039-Reviews-Olivia_Balmes_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,5.0,5.0

We came back on the 9th shortly after 19.00 and we got no queues and a great table. The place filled up within the next half-hour thereafter.

Great functional hotel but the breakfast could be improved,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights between 17th to 20th October 2017. For the price we paid, it ticked all our boxes except the breakfast. It was flat and bland for most offerings and my wife stopped taking her breakfast after the second day and only opted for the fruits.

That's said, I think the reception staff were great with quick check in and check out and were generally very friendly.

We had a room on the 5th floor away from the street which was great for us as we were not disturbed by street level noise. The bed was the highlight of our stay - soft beds and pillows. The showers are also quite basic but functional - nothing to complain about.

We also had some errands in Leeds and Manchester and this hotel was literally 5 minutes walk from the bus station (Bradford Interchange) and his made our stay very convenient due to this location advantage of the hotel. The shopping malls are also nearby - approximately 5 minutes walk from the hotel as well. Quite convenient.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend - and will be back but the management needs to consider significant improvements to the breakfast offering.",October 2017,Jurys Inn Bradford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186408-d1785921-Reviews-Jurys_Inn_Bradford-Bradford_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Bradford, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0

"Three words - Luxury, Calm and Tranquil !!!","My wife and I spent our Easter weekend (3 nights from 14th to 17th April 2017) at this gorgeous camp and we both agreed that there is a very relaxed feel to this luxury ""camp"". We both achieved our key objective of recharging our batteries after a gruesome 3 months from the beginning of the year and the camp is purpose-built for tranquillity.

All previous reviewers have mentioned the rave positive reviews but a few points stood out for us:

1. We booked directly with the camp and the process was flawless and efficient. Special thanks to Michael Munene for his support prior to our arrival.

2. We arrived mid afternoon and the team received us warmly with a cold glass of juice and a sumptuous lunch prior to actual check-in. Its like they read our minds as we were very hungry upon arrival.

3. Three things stand out for this luxury camp - Staff, Room and Food. The staff are very polite and friendly and always checking up on whether all is well (without being too intrusive) either at the room, the dining area or the pool area. The Manager is also present throughout to reconfirm that all is well.

4. The room ('tent"") is probably the best and most luxurious we have ever stayed in on our holidays - and we have slept at some of the best in the world. Its very spacious with separate bathroom, toilet, make-up area, patio and an outside area overlooking the lake. We got Room 3 and the view was spectacular. A side-note is that the rooms can get quite chilly at night so they also supply hot water bottles to complement body heat and they also cover up the tent from the outside to keep the cold at bay.

5. My wife and I also unanimously agree that the food was very delicious. Attention to the slightest detail and we had the chance to speak to the chef one morning when he was doing his rounds and he is genuinely interested to receive feedback on areas of improvement. Also to mention that the menu is largely a la carte though during Easter, a buffet was served on one of the evenings. Overall, we enjoyed all meals throughout our stay.

6. There is no TV anywhere - for us who wanted to hibernate for the weekend, this served us perfectly. You get to talk, socialise and listen to the in-house guitarist every evening. And also just take in the breath-taking views across the camp and the lake. Awesome!!!

7. There are a number of activities that were arranged by the camp - we rode bikes, swam, took a nature walk and even played badminton on the gardens. There are more activities such as archery, tree-planting etc. The place is geared towards physical socialisation and exercise instead of online captivity - which we really liked.

8. The camp is less than 2 hours from Nairobi and is easily accessible from the main highway. Anyone can make an easy dash for a 1-2 day break from the hustle and bustle of the city. This will not be our last visit to this wonderful establishment.

Though these did not dampen our visit in any way, a few areas for future consideration are:

1. Please convert the pool to a heated pool. It could get a little too cold which may discourage guests from taking the plunge!

2. Please also add fridges and safes in the rooms in future.

We highly recommend for anyone seeking to hibernate and recharge from the city for a short break. We will be back!!!

Good and popular hotel in Hargeisa,"I stayed here on business from 22nd to 26th January 2017 and I must say I was surprised by how good this hotel was in the middle of all the adversity facing this region.

The general hotel condition and outlook was quite good with extensive security arrangements at the gate, concrete barriers across the compound and also across the hotel building, large lobby area and generally good facilities all around.

The room was fairly priced and was of decent size with TV, balcony, and strong WiFi for internet access across the hotel.

The food (including breakfast) was also good and reasonably priced and delicious too. Please try out the steak - really enjoyed it. The wait service comprises young men who deliver your food orders very quickly which was good though they could consider employing women as well for their economic empowerment.

The hotel is noticeably very popular with foreigners and government officials and is good for conducting meetings. I had the added convenience that the government Ministries are within a 10 minute drive from this hotel.

Overall, I liked this hotel and considering that I have many more business trips to Hargeisa in the future, I shall continue staying here.

At the end of it all, the tab of IDR 7,000,000 was quite mind-boggling though we drank 4 bottles of wine which are not cheap at KDT.

We all enjoyed a good 5 hours here and sampled all they had to offer from the tornado to the slides on mats. There are life guards all around which was reassuring especially for the kids and good fun all around. There is also good food and drinks and lockers at reasonable prices.

There were more than enough day beds on this day for chilling out listening to music and looking out across the ocean. We also played some games (soccer) on the field and enjoyed the hammocks. The bitings, snacks and drinks were also reasonably priced and overall a great day for us.

Breathtaking and Blissful Paradise in Bali - Villa Bliss 2!!,"We visited Villa Bliss 2 as a family of 6 (from Kenya) comprising my twin nephews, 2 sisters in law, my wife and I for 11 nights from 24th December 2016 to 04th January 2017. All the 6 of us agreed unanimously that this was our best vacation ever because of how cosy our villa stay was.

What specifically made our stay so memorable are the following:

1. Even prior to our visit, our continuous interactions with the owner, Annette, already set the tone for our holiday. She is the very best and promptly responded to our enquiries and also gave us advise on how to make the best of our trip to Bali. We kept our communications with her even through our arrival, during our stay and after our stay to feedback on how great our stay was. Thanks very much Annette.

2. All the staff at the villa itself were excellent. Starting from the villa manager, Ary, who checked up on us from time to time to ensure that all was well. Then there were Siti and Nangya (hope the spelling is correct) who ensured that the villa was spotless throughout our stay and also supported us in shopping and prepared for us some Balinese food (including all breakfasts) and gave us a brief orientation into their culture. Then there was the transport team of Made supported by his brother Wayan who seemed to know the exact places that we needed to go and drove us safely to all these places (Ubud, Kerobokan, Canggu, Seminyak, Kuta, Sanur, Denpasar, Nusa Dua, Jimbaran, Ulawatu, Bakas among others). These are great people and we are grateful to them for making our holiday great.

3. The villa is located in Umalas which is the quieter part of Bali and fitted well with our intentions of pure relaxation during our holiday. It is not far from Seminyak and most of all the places that we wanted to visit. Transportation is easily available through Made and also via the ever reliable Blue Bird Taxi with all contacts available at the villa. The villa also has brochures and contacts of just about anything you want in Bali from food deliveries, adventures, sports, and much more. Made, Siti and the team can advise you on a good itinerary. There is a villa cellphone with a local Bali number which helped us a great deal during our stay.

4. The layout of the villa is also very good with 3 rooms sleeping 6 all opening into a central lounge where all of us would meet and chat way the evenings watching TV or lazing around. The pool is straight out-front and was one of our biggest attractions during our stay as Bali was quiet humid during our visit. This villa is exactly as it looks in the TripAdvisor photos and we are glad we chose it for our stay.

5. The villa also provided Platinum Cards which gave us access to Canggu Club and Finns Beach Club. We visited both clubs and were pleasantly surprised that we got in without the hassle of the minimum spend deposit at both clubs.

Overall, this is an amazing villa and would definitely recommend to all who are visiting Bali especially if you are looking for a quieter location and venturing our into the crazier areas occasionally.

Good hotel considering the scarcity of quality hotels in Djibouti!!,"I visited Djibouti between 26th - 29th November 2016 and stayed at this hotel. I have rated this hotel as 4* but travellers need to get the perspective that Djibouti lacks decent hotel facilities with only about 5 good hotels to choose from and therefore the pricing tends to be quite high for these few hotels.

Specifically, I found this hotel to be quite good for the short stay. I have summarised the key aspects of the hotel as follows:

THE GOOD STUFF

1. Large spacious rooms with the option of ceiling fans and air conditioning with decent toilet amenities. The views from the rooms on 4th Floor are quite spectacular as well.
2. Ample space in the lobby from where you can work and people watch. The lobby is quite cool as well due to the air conditioning
3. Food caters to international visitors so almost everyone can find something of their preference on the menu
4. The staff are generally polite, courteous, well mannered and willing to assist
5. The hotel compound and general neighbourhood is well secured - there are metal detection checks and body pats at the entrance to the hotel which were reassuring though Djibouti is generally a quiet and safe city. The Kempinski is a short walk from this hotel and provides alternative dining options if needed
6. The pool seemed great for a swim in the hot weather but we never got to use it due to our packed meetings schedule over the 2 days.

THE ""NOT SO GREAT"" STUFF

1. The hotel is EXPENSIVE in all respects - from accommodation, food and transport services.
2. The service is EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW. Food orders take a minimum of 1 hour to be ready. Cleaning of rooms and changing of beddings and toiletries is done towards the end of day so most of our rooms were not done when we popped back from our meetings. The reception staff also do not seem to be able to cater to large groups and seemed bewildered with multiple requests from our group.
3. We encountered some sense of confusion during our visit - our airport transfer was not present to pick us from the airport upon arrival despite prior confirmations that the hotel had made all these arrangements. We ended up using the green local taxis to the hotel (mind you these taxis are VERY OLD and look like they can fall apart at any moment). Upon arrival, the reception staff told us that the airport pick-up had been arranged for a different time though we had reconfirmed our pick-up before departure from Nairobi. On the upside, the local taxis charged us 9,000 Djibouti Francs (US$ 50) for 3 taxis as compared to the hotel proposed charge of USD 200 for our group.
4. The breakfast spread is VERY LIMITED. An assortment of bread and a few fruits and juice to go. The hot station mainly catered for fried eggs.

The hotel has its ups and downs but considering the options available in Djibouti, I will be back on business to Les Acacia and will recommend it to other visitors on short visits (upto 5 days).",November 2016,Les Acacias Hotel Djibouti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293787-d2421844-Reviews-Les_Acacias_Hotel_Djibouti-Djibouti.html,"Djibouti, Djibouti",hotels,4.0,3.0
Good for meetings and workshops though need for improved maintenance,"We had a meeting with our clients at this hotel from 7th - 9th September 2016 in one of their many nice meeting rooms. The staff were really great and the refreshments were top-notch and would be replenished quite frequently during our meeting. The lunch meals are also quite great with good presentation as well.

The conference facilities such as projectors, stationery etc were also great and in abundant supply.

However, on our final day of meetings, the roof just above the reception collapsed under the weight of a burst water tank from the roof and the water was dripping through the lighting system which we thought was quite dangerous. To their credit, the establishment mobilised all personnel to seal off the affected area and drain out the flood water that had accumulated around the reception area. Another problem we had is that cellphone signals are very weak in this hotel hence very difficult to communicate with the outside world.

Presumably the collapsed ceiling has been repaired by now and the hotel looks as glamorous as we found it on our first day. I would recommend this hotel for workshops, seminars and meetings. Quite a hidden gem.",September 2016,DoubleTree by Hilton Nairobi Hurlingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294207-d9810215-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Nairobi_Hurlingham-Nairobi.html,"Nairobi, Kenya",hotels,4.0,4.5
Impressed!,"My sister-in-law, my wife and I spent 2 nights at this hotel from the 20th October 2016 as part of our short trip to Kampala to attend a friends wedding and we were quite impressed.

At the outset, we are very grateful to Nazima for offering us very competitive rates for 2 double rooms for the length of our stay. This was greatly appreciated and set the positive tone for the rest of our enjoyable visit.

The hotel itself is quiet and set on vast grounds with restaurants, pool, etc among many other amenities. We really enjoyed our time on the first evening at the Asian Fusion restaurant while enjoying the cool breeze and the great music. It seems like a very popular restaurant as well. The breakfast is served in the main restaurant upstairs and the spread was of good standard.

My sister-in-law and my wife enjoyed shopping for clothes at the shops downstairs as I also enjoyed an early morning swim at the pool.

The rooms were also very good with the basic amenities such as TV, air conditioning, balcony etc with a cosy bed of decent size. The only gripe was the overflow of the shower which tended to flood the bathroom and management should look into this.

On the last night, I fell ill and the in-house medical lady came up to our room and prescribed some pain relief medicine which was well appreciated. It helped me have a good night. It was also appreciated that the hotel accepted a late check-out of 01.00pm the next day and this enabled me to have adequate rest from my ailment to be able to embark on my return journey back home.

Overall, this was a great hotel and we highly recommend it and will stay here next time we visit Kampala and special thanks to Nazima for her support.",October 2016,Fairway Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293841-d586608-Reviews-Fairway_Hotel-Kampala_Central_Region.html,"Kampala, Uganda",hotels,4.0,4.0
Clearly the best restaurant in Nairobi!!!,"My wife and I finally visited The Talisman on a 16th October 2016 and this was clearly a jaw-dropping experience. Its been said before by all who have been to the Talisman before us but in summary:

1. The ambience is to die for - rustic yet leafy and cool on a hot Sunday afternoon
2. The service is efficient and felt very personalised - we felt like we had our own personal butler,
3. The food - sumptuous and tasty - we both had the char-grilled steak. All the plates passing by our table looked delicious. We plan to sample the entire menu in weeks and months to come. The prices were also quite decent with great bang for your buck!
4. Location was great - right off Ngong road and easily accessible.
5. Good blend of foreigners and locals. This is clearly a very famous restaurant in Nairobi. Seems like a wonderful outing place for both business or leisure.

This brought us to the conclusion that this is clearly the best restaurant in Nairobi and we have been to many restaurants in the city. We will be regular patrons into the future at least upto the point where we would have exhausted their menu.

Well done to The Talisman team and see you soon!!!",October 2016,The Talisman Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294207-d1059634-Reviews-The_Talisman_Restaurant-Nairobi.html,"Nairobi, Kenya",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Cool and quiet!!,"Stayed at this hotel on 27th August 2016 as part of a wider team from Kenya attending a wedding ceremony nearby. Overall, the place was quite cool, quiet and peaceful which made the nights very restful. The room is quite spacious with the normal amenities including TV and hot shower and great bed provided. Additionally, the prices were quite good for a single room at just over US$ 30 per night. Parking spaces outside were also plentiful and security to match.

The only improvement area for me was the breakfast spread which seemed limited and could be enhanced further.

Otherwise, great hotel and would stay again the next time am in Jinja!!",August 2016,Nile Anchor Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g480250-d1596423-Reviews-Nile_Anchor_Palace-Jinja_Eastern_Region.html,"Jinja, Uganda",hotels,4.0,4.0
Basic place for overnight layover,"I have stayed at this hotel on various occasions over the years mostly for overnight stop-over en-route to other destinations. The place is quite basic and will suffice for a night or two (max). The amenities in the rooms are functional with TV and hot shower and simple bed. Nothing fancy.

The breakfast is decent and can get you going for the day. The hotel is near the bus park and starts getting very noisy from 06.00am in the morning.

I will continue coming here on short stop-overs in the future.",August 2016,Hotel Palmers Ltd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g317064-d2073476-Reviews-Hotel_Palmers_Ltd-Kisumu_Nyanza_Province.html,"Kisumu, Kenya",hotels,3.0,3.0
Great resort though 50-50 on the food handling!!,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights from 05th August 2016 and it was one of the most relaxing escapes we have had in a while. We really enjoyed our Ocean Front Room 15A (I think this is the best room in the entire resort) as it opens out to the ocean and was on the upper floor.

The resort has a large pool and also many activities such as water polo, water aerobics, darts, table tennis and many more and very robust kids club with plenty of activities. We really enjoyed ourselves during our trip. We did beach walks in the mornings and it was so much fun - there are a lot of beach operators for boat rides and snorkelling trips which you can enjoy for half or full-day.

Our main issue was around food handling especially lunch and dinner. The handling of utensils by the staff was quite unhygienic in our view eg on several occasions, a waiter would bring forks and spoons while holding with bare hands the ""food end"" of the utensils and not the handles - this has got to change urgently as we were unable to use them and decided to wash our own utensils using bottled water. We appreciated that most of the staff are from the local communities but training has to be top-notch to guard against hygiene related diseases.

Otherwise, the resort is lots of fun with friendly staff and good facilities and we would visit again though we would eat at a neighbouring 5-star hotel if the hygiene issues are not resolved quickly.",August 2016,Turtle Bay Beach Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g661279-d459930-Reviews-Turtle_Bay_Beach_Club-Watamu_Coast_Province.html,"Watamu, Kenya",hotels,3.0,4.5
Delicious!,"We were staying at a neighbouring hotel and visited Amandina on the evening of 8th August 2016 after enjoying the full-massage at the Medina Spa.

The king prawns was impeccably served and the ambience was to die for. At the time of our visit, there were a few diners and we were informed that many guests prefer to have their meals in-room. The views from Amandina are also quite refreshing and we really enjoyed our food.

We highly recommend this restaurant and we will be back in the future.",August 2016,Amandina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g661279-d6908327-Reviews-Amandina-Watamu_Coast_Province.html,"Watamu, Kenya",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Charcoal grilled prawns!!,"My wife and I visited this restaurant as part of our Malindi tour on 8th August 2016. This is a vintage Malindi eatery right by the ocean with good views and air conditioning to match the Malindi heat.

We were served charcoal grilled king prawns and were probably the most delicious we have ever had with authentic taste. Contrary to other reviews, the service was quite fast though this could have been due to the fact that there was only one other couple in the restaurant at the time of our visit.

We highly recommend and would definitely return on our next visit to Malindi.",August 2016,Old Man & The Sea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298253-d1214060-Reviews-Old_Man_The_Sea-Malindi_Coast_Province.html,"Malindi, Kenya",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Fantastic ice cream!!,"My wife and I visited this ice cream parlour on 7th August 2016 and we confirm that they serve up the best ice cream in Coastal Kenya. The owner, Andrea, was quite friendly was chatted with us when we arrive.

This place seemed quite famous as the place was packed when we arrived and many more guests arrived after us.

We definitely recommend this parlour and we will return on our next trip to Watamu.",August 2016,Bahati Gelateria Italianna Andrea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g661279-d2446152-Reviews-Bahati_Gelateria_Italianna_Andrea-Watamu_Coast_Province.html,"Watamu, Kenya",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Other than the pillar, nothing else to do really","My wife and I went back to this pillar in August 2016 after last visiting it in 1987 and there was nothing new except that this time, there was a small fee of US$ 1 per person to see the pillar. Once you have taken your photos, there is nothing else to do other than gaze at the ocean horizons.

In case you are visiting Malindi for the first time, you may squeeze in a 1-hour detour to visit the Pillar.",August 2016,Vasco da Gama Pillar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298253-d2465943-Reviews-Vasco_da_Gama_Pillar-Malindi_Coast_Province.html,"Malindi, Kenya",attractions,3.0,3.5
Extremely dull property for vacation seekers!!,"Went there as part of a Government Conference in August 2015 (a year ago) and this place is designed almost entirely for workshops, seminars and conferences. The facilities are just OK and rooms fairly basic. The food is also acceptable to conferencing standards. There is only a swimming pool near the dining area and that's it. It can be quite boring and dull for vacationers as there is practically nothing else to do.

My advise for people seeking vacations along this route to proceed on to Laikipia which is 2 hours further ahead but a lot more exciting.",September 2015,Sagana Getaway Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1026015-d8869355-Reviews-Sagana_Getaway_Resort-Makuyu_Central_Province.html,"Makuyu, Kenya",hotels,3.0,3.5
