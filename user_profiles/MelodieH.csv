Don't miss this!,"The Acropolis is the jewel of Athens! It houses the Parthenon (beautiful!), Erechtheion (a Temple dedicated to both Athena and Poseidon), Theatre of Dionysus (built in the 4th century), Temple of Athena Nike (ionic temple built around 420 BC), Odeon of Herodes Atticus (stone theatre built in 161 AD), and many ruins and bits of ruins, bits of statues just lying around. Don't miss this! Oh, and bring a sun hat or a parasol, plenty of water, sunscreen, and your camera!",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A must see!,"If you're spending any time in Athens, the museum is a must-see! The exhibits are beautiful!

"Great food, beautiful location, friendly staff","Wonderful food and wine in the Plaka. Beautiful location, shaded by lovely greenery. Friendly staff. Wonderful food. I went a couple times because it was so good. Great place for solo travelers or for groups.

"Fun, but not an adrenaline rush","I had to try this. 11 stories up, flying over the crowds but beneath the canopy of lights and music. I had built up this experience in my mind too much it seems because after a waiting in line, being organized, getting fitted with a harness, waiting for your turn (nice view up there though!), being hooked up, and having your picture taken, you finally get launched out. I'm afraid of heights, but this didn't frighten me at all. 30-45 seconds later, you arrive at the other end. The jerk backwards at the end gave me more of a rush than the zipline unfortunately. Still, it's great for a lot of people. Not expensive by Vegas standards, and you get to say you did it. There are a ton of photos taken. $20 for one or $40-45 for all. If you're with a friend, get all of them and split the cost.",November 2018,SlotZilla Zip Line Las Vegas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d6433945-Reviews-SlotZilla_Zip_Line_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,3.0,4.5

"Oh so tasty! Fresh, housemade deliciousness!","This unassuming little place is a butcher's first and foremost, but it is also a little grill where they serve a fantastic shwarma, hand-cut fries, and house-made ginger ale! And to top it all off, you are always served with a friendly smile. If you're in the mood to chat a little, ask the butcher/host about his food and products. He takes pride in ownership and it's so wonderful to see someone light up when they speak passionately about the business they love. If you're in the neighborhood do not pass up a chance to eat here.",May 2018,Bold Butchery & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154945-d13458126-Reviews-Bold_Butchery_Grill-Victoria_Victoria_Capital_Regional_District_Vancouver_Island.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Beautiful atmosphere, but super pricey","The Bard is definitely a beautiful building and the interior boasts a lot of rich, dark woods, gorgeous chandeliers, and an atmosphere of the old world. What this means however, is that you will definitely pay for it through the price of the food and alcohol! A glass of wine that is typically $7 or $8 elsewhere, will run you $10 to $14 here. The food is ok, but not really worth the price. The servers are always friendly and helpful however. If you want a beautiful place to eat, and don't mind paying a little too much for what you're served, then sure, why not go here. This is more of a touristy type place rather than a place where the locals hang out.",August 2018,Bard & Banker,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154945-d1109616-Reviews-Bard_Banker-Victoria_Victoria_Capital_Regional_District_Vancouver_Island_British_.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",restaurants,3.0,4.5
I never tire of this place,"I'm a local and I love this little corner of the city. The shops full of curious little trinkets, the wonderful food, the fresh produce every morning, the hidden alleyways (Fantan is very popular, but don't miss Dragon Alley on the other side of the street), the decorated street lamps painted red and gold , and of course the Gate of Harmonious Interest that welcome everyone. It's beautiful any time of year, but especially in the spring when the cherry blossoms are in bloom.",August 2018,Chinatown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154945-d155443-Reviews-Chinatown-Victoria_Victoria_Capital_Regional_District_Vancouver_Island_British_Col.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",attractions,5.0,4.0

"Pleasant stay, clean room, fantastic staff","I stayed here in the beginning of June on a business trip. At first I was a little concerned with the reviews that complained about the noise from the freeway, but found this to not be a problem at all. The room was very comfortable, large, clean (this is very important to me), and had all that I needed. While the room may not be 5 star (a very shiny 3), the staff certainly are 5 star! They are extremely helpful, and very friendly - all of them! Front desk, lounge, housekeepers... all had a cheerful ""Good morning"", ""hello"", a quick chat, or a warm smile. It's stuff like this that keeps a person coming back. If I am in the area for business again, I will definitely be staying here.",June 2018,Holiday Inn Express Portland SE-Clackamas Area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g51883-d102029-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Portland_SE_Clackamas_Area-Gladstone_Clackamas_County_Oregon.html,"Gladstone, Oregon",hotels,4.0,3.5
Buy peanuts before going!,"Peanuts in the shell. Non-salted. Squirrels will gently take them from your hands, peacocks will try to be gentle, the geese, not so much... :) Duck food can be purchased from Bulk Barn downtown. Don't feed them bread! Bring your camera to photograph the wildlife and the beautiful scenery, especially when all the flowers are in bloom. A beautiful park to visit any time of day and any time of year. Oh!

"Not very friendly, warn out and old","Upon arriving, we were not even acknowledged.... stood at the counter for a couple minutes before even being blandly welcomed. No smile even. Room was the smallest, most cramped one I've ever been in... This was the room for the military ""discount"". For an extra $20 we would have had a bigger, nicer room with a balcony. Guess they don't appreciate military service. The room was pretty clean, but very old and very worn. Wallpaper was ripped, carpeting needs to be replaced and the smoke alarm in the room next door was going off. Same poor customer service on check out. Didn't ask how the stay was. No smile again. Nothing. Not worth staying here. Spend the extra $30 for a much better hotel elsewhere.",February 2018,Inn at the Quay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g154936-d183555-Reviews-Inn_at_the_Quay-New_Westminster_British_Columbia.html,"New Westminster, Canada",hotels,2.0,4.0

What can I say? It's a Cheesecake Factory.... but GREAT service,"It's a Cheesecake Factory - a typical chain restaurant... but the service here was out of this world. My friend mentioned she was chilly, and the server came by with warmed napkins for her shoulders! We were served with smiles, pleasant chit chat, an appropriate amount of attentiveness (she was not annoying at all), and all 'round great service.

It was juicy and full of flavour; I was quite impressed. The fries were a little too thin for my liking (they got cold fast), but they were still tasty. My friend and I were seated across from the expansive salt water fish tank - it was huge!

"Beautiful hotel, great staff - they saved me from a horrid B&B","I stayed at this hotel in August 2009 and what a treasure it is! From the friendly, helpful, courteous staff, to the large, clean, tasteful room with a gorgeous view of the Promenade, this hotel has it all. No complaints whatsoever - I definitely recommend this hotel for anyone. After I arrived on the IOM, I checked into a little B&B that I had booked online.

I was trying to travel on a bit of a budget (traveling alone and went to the IOM to do some family research) and selected the B&B due to cost, and the room seemed clean and tidy from what I could find of the pictures. I was oh so wrong! It was a horrible place so I immediately went in search of something more to my liking.

It didn't take long for me to come across the Sefton and upon explaining my situation, I was treated to a wonderful angel who gave me a great rate for an incredible room - she truly salvaged my little vacation/family research trip and helped make my stay a most wonderful one.

The room was lovely, the grounds wonderful, the beach spectacular, the staff friendly and professional, the food tasty and the all around atmosphere incredible!",August 2009,Sefton Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190928-d193937-Reviews-Sefton_Hotel-Douglas_Isle_of_Man.html,"Isle of Man, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,3.5
