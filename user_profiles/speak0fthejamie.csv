The climb is worth it,"Climbing up to the top of Mount Lycabettus is definitely worth the views from the top.. 360° of the whole city, the only thing is the climb can be pretty tough but even stopping half way up to take in some extra views is well worth it.",October 2020,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Brilliant,"To be fair I always put off doing one of these games but booked in for a staff party recently, and we had a great time!

Not what I expected at all, really clever and great fun!

Game was hosted by Chris who was brilliant, very friendly and helpful!",October 2018,AdventureRooms Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d7827181-Reviews-AdventureRooms_Dublin-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Lovely Hotel, not great restaurant!","So myself and girlfriend stayed recently... The hotel and room itself was absolutely fabulous!
Gorgeous hotel, with fabulous views from the top floor!
Very well located in Dun Laoghaire town right beside the pier and The Peoples Park!

Unfortunately there’s was one twist that really ruined the whole experience, as it was my girlfriends birthday we had planned to have a nice dinner in the restaurant.. We came down and were seated for 7.30/7.45, with the kitchen closing at 9 we had enough time to get through a main course and dessert?
Or so we thought... now our order was taken pretty quickly although we were waiting about 40 minutes for the main course with some of what was in the menu description missing, (seafood platter missing crab claws) wouldn’t have been a problem if we were informed! while the other plate was clearly waiting on the hot plate for a while!
-Warm salad, dry potatoes and a piping hot dish!

8.30 we had finished our mains with still half an hour before the kitchen closed, we sat with empty plates waiting for a server, until 9!
We then asked for a desert menu to which the reply was “Sorry the kitchens closed, and the chefs in a bad mood so I don’t really want to ask”
I’m sorry but I didn’t realise my meal and experience depended on what kind of day the chef had!

Sure enough we waited for 30 minutes only to get up and go around to McDonalds for a flake McFlurry in the end!

Coming from 2 people who work in the hospitality industry, this is far from acceptable and would not tolerate it from our own staff!",July 2018,Royal Marine Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186606-d651610-Reviews-Royal_Marine_Hotel-Dun_Laoghaire_County_Dublin.html,"Dún Laoghaire, Ireland",hotels,3.0,4.0
Good value.,"Hotel Iris is a quiet little hotel which is perfect for those who plan to spend most of the days out and about. It's cheap and cheerful, staff are very friendly and helpful. It's situated right across from Lidl which is perfect if you want to do some cheap shopping and keep food in your room.

The room was quite small and narrow but again, we didn't spend much time there as we were out and about most of the days. Overall it was worth what we paid.",February 2015,Iris Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188590-d1107307-Reviews-Iris_Hotel-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",hotels,3.0,3.0
