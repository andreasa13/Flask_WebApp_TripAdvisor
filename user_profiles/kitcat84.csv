Closing time not as stated,"Having been to the Acropolis we figured it made sense to do the museum, however we arrived at 4pm, and were told as we were paying that it closed at 5. We assumed this would be enough time, and as people who weren’t going to read every description and agonise over every detail of every plinth it would have been. However, at 4.45 the staff started rounding everyone up and kicking them out and it wasn’t a ‘just to let you know, we’re closing soon’ it was a ‘you need to leave now’.

A bit of a poor show to sell tickets that late when they close earlier than they say. We got downstairs just after 4.50pm hoping for a quick look in the gift shop and it was already shut!

There were some interesting things in there, but I think the admission should be included in the acropolis price, or at the very least it should be on the multi-attraction ticket for the acropolis. I didn’t think it was particularly great value.",January 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
One of those perfect days,"The acropolis was absolutely stunning. We visited in January so there was no queue to get in, it was bright sunshine and warm enough to be pleasant. The sky was clear and the views from the top are stunning. The acropolis is an amazing feat in itself, but I hadn’t realised how incredible it’s setting was until I got up there. It should be on everyone’s bucket list.",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
The sun’s set... now get out!,"We, as many people do, came to the temple to watch the sunset. We arrived around lunch time and had lunch in the cafe - the food was nice enough but it was over-priced as you’d expect at a tourist attraction in the middle of nowhere. We figured we’d go up to the temple while it was light and go back later on at sunset - only you’re not allowed to do that. The admission price is 5 Euro, which considering you can’t reenter and there is one sign with 3 paragraphs of information is a bit unnecessary.

The closing time was not 8pm as listed on trip advisor, but ‘sunset’. Sunset closing meant literally as soon as the sun was under the horizon, despite there still being plenty of light and beautiful skies to enjoy, the woman from the ticket desk came round shouting at people and blowing her whistle telling people to get out as it was closed.

The best skies and therefore best pictures happened after sunset, but couldn’t be enjoyed from the best vantage point by the temple. We thought they’d be open until 6 at least, but they kicked everyone out just after 5.30. We’d also intended to have a drink in the cafe and wait for the final bus at 7pm, but everything closed and it was cold, dark and we were pretty much on our own in the middle of nowhere.

Be warned- everyone is out of there as soon as the sun sets, and if you’re going to take pictures you’ll miss the best ones as they happen after closing - at least at this time of year anyway.

That said, it’s an amazing place to sit and get off the world for a while. The temple is in a beautiful setting, although itself is nothing that you can’t see in the centre of Athens and it’s a bit of a pain by public transport and expensive otherwise!",January 2020,Temple of Poseidon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562628-d312283-Reviews-Temple_of_Poseidon-Sounio_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Sounio, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Love it,"Consistently great food and service - really love this place. I have been multiple times at different times of day and it has always been excellent. I'd recommend the lamb shish, the adana, the halloumi, the baba ganoush... I could go on...",January 2017,Marina Meze Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1635502-d7245641-Reviews-Marina_Meze_Grill-Woodford_Redbridge_Greater_London_England.html,"Woodford, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful,"A really relaxing place with lots to see. It is a bit of trek, as the gardens are on many levels and you have to walk back up them all to the exit - although I believe there are golf buggies for those who need help. I could have spent all day in here pottering around and admiring the view and just relaxing in the sunshine. There are several different routes around the gardens depending how long you want to spend in there.

If you don't want to get the cable car up, then you can take bus 20 or 21. Don't be fooled by the taxi drivers... the same busses will take you down to the marina too.",January 2017,Monte Palace Madeira,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189167-d196135-Reviews-Monte_Palace_Madeira-Funchal_Madeira_Madeira_Islands.html,"Madeira, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wish we hadn't bothered,"This was a massive disappointment. We had booked for my friend's 30th birthday, as the website claims to cater for adults and corporate events as well as children and we thought it would be fun and a bit different. Right from the very start when we watched a video of an 'agent' briefing us, who pushed a fax machine (or similar) off a crash barrier and claimed 'communications were down', it was clear this was not going to be quite what we expected.

We worked through several rooms, which had fairly tedious exercises in them. The technology was fairly fitting for a 30th birthday in the sense that it also looked like it was from the 80s, and the computers failed to work properly in several games. The girl taking us round seem to make no allowance for the fact that we were adults. We were told how to do things rather than allowed to work out how to do it ourselves and we finished each room very quickly, we then had time to kill and were met with the same tedious exercise at the end of each room, which was basically a shape sorting game.

While I wasn't expecting to be blown up if we accidentally walked through a laser, I would have expected some sort of consequence to not doing the activities properly, or at least some simulation of mild peril! The whole thing seemed rather aimless. There was a section where you are supposed to walk through a corridor without touching any lasers, we were gearing up for a scene from entrapment, but when you realise you can just walk through the set of laser beams and it doesn't matter, it does seem rather a lot of effort to duck and dive, especially when they're clearly spaced for small children.

The idea is great. The execution of it is dreadful. The whole place is tatty, some of the bits you have to climb on are held together by gaffer tape, the slide at the end looked like a bit of a death trap. In general it reminded me of that episode of phoenix nights where they try to make a fun fair in a toilet block. Young kids might enjoy it, but I would suggest that this is pretty low-tech even for most children now. I couldn't quite believe how something with so much potential was so bad!
