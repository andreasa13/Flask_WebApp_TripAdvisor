Old for the New,"The National Archaeological Museum holds treasures that you will probably expect, but many more than you will know about. It is important to do a virtual tour to understand the history behind the museum and its treats - you see the rest of your museums and places around Greece in new light afterwards.",August 2018,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Time to eat,Any time is time to eat in Plaka - it is the most fabulous adventure that you can take in the area of Greek food - not one of the restaurants will be a dud : they couldnt survive if they were?,August 2018,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Visit this early,"Everyone who goes to Athens sees the Acropolis - but those who visit it after a long walk or drive normally share the visit with hundreds of others all at the same time.
If you want a small amount of privacy, get there at 8am and perbook your ticket so that you have the place to yourself and very few of the others who will eventually take over the space and make it difficult for photos.
Just a tip, but its one that you will thank me for once you get some great shots - it is a must to see this ruin, it not only humbles you, but makes you realise that there is more to the ancients that just marble .",August 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best Modern Museum,"When you tell people how good this museum is - they accept it, but when they actually go there, they get it.... so will you.
This museum is very stylish, has only been around for a short life time, and holds the history and antiquities from the acropolis.
It is a must see experience - you need to physically walk over the dig under the museum, listen to the story of how the acropolis has been removed off shore and feel the immence power of the statues that remain in tact that are a record of this country's incredible artistic prowess and magnitude.
It is important to take a side trip to the gift stores both in the foyer and the 2nd floor as these hold treasures that are sensible gifts and probably better than anthing you will find in the tourist trap of Plakka.
PS dont try to take a photo inside this museum until you reach the top floor - its a sketch only environment which is delightful in this day and age.",August 2018,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
