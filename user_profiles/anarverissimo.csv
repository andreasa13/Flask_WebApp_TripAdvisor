Great afternoon paddling with manatees,"The weather was perfect and our awesome guide Kayla took us through the various springs (magnolia, hunter, jurassic, 3 sisters) and spotted lots of manatees for us.

History with a view,"Really nice to walk around all the buildings. There is also interesting information on the ongoing restoration project and the methods used. The view from up there is magnificent.
Close to everything. On the way down, we found a narrow and steep little alley full of charming little restaurants, where we stopped for some greek treats (starters) and a drink.",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Sunrise at Borobudur,"The journey started at 3:30 am and we made it to the top on time for the sunrise. However, it was too misty and we could not see it. After the day got brighter, we spent time exploring the magnificent temple and then went down for breakfast, that was included in the tour. This tour includes the driver and breakfast only. Any tickets to temples are paid in addition.
After Borobudur, we went to see it from below, on the way back through some other small temples (also paid separately). Near one of them, we got to visit a place where they produce luwak coffee and we sat down to try it.
The tour also included going up to a mountain on a jeep (paid separately), but it was too misty for that, so we just headed back to the hotel for a rest.
Even though we did not see the sunrise from the postcards, the temple is still worth visiting.",August 2019,Sunrise and Temples Tour from Yogyakarta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g294230-d11475928-Sunrise_and_Temples_Tour_from_Yogyakarta-Yogyakarta_Region_Java.html,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",activities,4.0,4.5
Beautiful sunrise,"We were picked up at midnight from Malang and made our way to the sunrise viewpoint.
We arrived early, so that we could park close to the place (it got crazy busy later). Since it was early, we were able to take a quick nap and then went to eat some banana fritters and a hot drink, next to a little fire, which was super nice, because it was chilly.
Then, the driver gave us instructions on how to find the best spot for the sunrise and we just had to wait for it. the spot was great and the sunrise was beautiful (the sky was super clear, so we could see all the mountains and there was an amazing sea of clouds underneath).
After the sunrise, we got back to the jeep, that was parked in a perfect spot to make a quick exit and we continued down to go hike up Mt Bromo to the caldera. After that, we drove through the sea of sand and started heading back. We also made a stop at a waterfall that was very pretty.
There was 1 more waterfall to visit, but it included more hiking, whereas and the other one could be seen from a short walk from the car park through a beautiful path in nature (there was also the option to walk for 30-45 min in the heat to get down there, but we just took pictures from above, which was great).",August 2019,Bromo sunrise tour via Tumpang - start Malang // 1 day tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g297710-d13346650-Bromo_sunrise_tour_via_Tumpang_start_Malang_1_day_tour-Malang_East_Java_Java.html,"Malang, Indonesia",activities,5.0,4.5
Beautiful!,"Awesome day tour!
We were picked up by a driver and taken to the start of the trail, where the local ranger was waiting for us. The view from the top is breathtaking and the hike down (and back up) is a little bit demanding but fine (high steps, ladders, ropes and even rocks on a stream, which felt great, as the weather was so hot!). Half-way, we stopped for some pictures at the first waterfall (not part of the main area) and then we headed down to the most amazing set of waterfalls, all around us!
Before heading back up, to the opposite side, there is also another waterfall and a pool, so we went there too.
Be prepared to get wet and take shoes to walk through the water. It's hot and humid, don't forget your bottle of water either!",August 2019,Day Tour - Tumpak Sewu Waterfall and Goa Tetes Trekking via Malang,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g297710-d16810115-Day_Tour_Tumpak_Sewu_Waterfall_and_Goa_Tetes_Trekking_via_Malang-Malang_East_Java_.html,"Malang, Indonesia",activities,5.0,5.0
2-day Xi'an panoramic tour,"On the first day we visited the terracotta army, toured on top of the city wall and explored the delicious food at Muslim street. On the second day we started off with the History museum and then the art museum, with a calligraphy lesson, followed by a visit to the Han dynasty terracotta army. The food was amazing on both days. Rosa, our guide, was super knowledgeable and knew all the tricks to get us to the places with least tourists so that we could enjoy the views more. Great two days in Xi'an!",October 2017,The Trippest Mini Group Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294212-d4006739-Reviews-The_Trippest_Mini_Group_Tours-Beijing.html,"Beijing, China",attractions,5.0,5.0
