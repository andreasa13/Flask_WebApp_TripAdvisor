Acropolis with a private tour,We hired Private Greek tours and arrived at the Acropolis before the mass of crowds. They had our tickets to enter and so we had no lines or delays. By the time we were leaving tour buses lined the roads waiting to get in. I loved this site because it was so awe inspiring to see a structure of this magnitude built without modern tools. It was unthinkable!,September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent Service,"We stayed at the Nerva Boutique hotel and was amazed at the wonderful and friendly service we received. They arranged for pick up and drop off of the airport and port. We had a delicious breakfast preparred by Sally every morning! She is delightful and wants to please everyone. We found our room sunny and bright, cool and relaxing. We even had 2 bathrooms in our Deluxe room. I would definately stay here again.

Athens- Private Greek tour,"We used Private Greek Tours and found Lazaros Liogas and his son Bill excellent! Bill is young and charming, speeks excellent English and very informative about Greek culture and his city. Lazaros was an exceptional driver and had a very comfortable auto for 4 adults. They met us promptly at the Port and made sure we saw everything that was on our list and more. He took us around traffice situations and brought us to the steps of the Acropolis before the crowds hit. Athens is a big city and knowing the ins and outs of manuvering through it was the best with this tour. Highlights were the Acropolis, Parliament changing of the guards and the highest point in Athens for the views of the city! Plaka shopping is a must!",September 2019,Private Greek Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2665523-Reviews-Private_Greek_Tours-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
