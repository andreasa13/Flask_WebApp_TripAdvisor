"Nice, but not very necessary museal addition to Acropolis.","Sympathetic museum, especially the top floor with parts of Acropolis on display. This floor was beautiful. The rest was more ordinary, and hidden behind too much design, quasi modern display and glass walls.

I much prefer The Archeological museum in Athens over this! And of course the Acropolis itself.

This museum is a nice, but not very necessary museal addition to Acropolis.",January 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
One of the best museums in the world,"The archeological museum in Athens is one of the best museums in the world, of any type. I rate it together with Egyptian museum in Cairo and Metropolitan in New York, or British Museum in London or Louvre in Paris. We were there three times and never got tired of studying the wonderful sculptures and marble heads in this huge and well displayed exhibition.
A must see for everyone interested in the past, in classical archeology and art.",January 2020,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Must see in Athens!!,"Acropolis must be one of the greatest places on earth, and at least in Athens. On the one hand it is very interesting historically, archaeologically, architecturally, etc, but it is also a magical place with a great view over Athens. Much more interesting than the Acropolis museum, which is ok, but not wonderful as Acropolis in itself.",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Lovely interior, no service","We had dinner at Ama Lachei several times during our one month stay in Athens. The food is ok, modernized Greek classics, big tapas style and cheap. The one major problem with the food is that the kitchen uses far too much oil in the food. The atmosphere is great, and the perfect interior with good tables and high ceilings are filled with beautiful people and families. Another major weakness with this place is lack of service. Service is extremely slow and almost negative. This is not uncommon in Greece, but still its provocative and appears rude.",January 2020,Ama Lachei at Nefeli's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6437392-Reviews-Ama_Lachei_at_Nefeli_s-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Great sushi in Athens!,"Izakaya was a pleasant surprise in Athens - and a sushi heaven. A little bit expensive, but great when you want god food, and something special. Very nice atmosphere and a great place to be.",January 2020,Izakaya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10373292-Reviews-Izakaya-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
