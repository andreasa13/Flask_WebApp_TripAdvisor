Good unguided visit,"Lots of sights to see. Good to see that such an important site is finally being restored.
Come early - the tourist mobs descended at about 9:30am...",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Seafood at night,"Came on an off-night, but the octopus, pickerel and sardines were great for this non-seafood lover. We could reach out and touch the water!",October 2019,Bali Beach Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3695488-d12865731-Reviews-Bali_Beach_Bar-Kalyvia_Thorikou_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Kalyvia Thorikou, Greece",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Great for lunch and dinner!,"Great Greek food including souvlaki and kabobs. Chicken, pork, beef trays/pita/gyros were all great for adults and kids. Careful: the Giant Pita is huge! Enough for two meals. Wait staff communicate fine in English. We have not come in the evening but it is packed!",October 2019,Piatsa Souvlaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3695488-d15123341-Reviews-Piatsa_Souvlaki-Kalyvia_Thorikou_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Kalyvia Thorikou, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Didn't want to leave!,"What a great B&B experience! The Williamsburg White House is conveniently located across the street from the College of William and Mary, and just an 8-minute walk to Colonial Williamsburg. John and Debbie are wonderful hosts, and completely knowledgeable about historic sites, places to eat, and just life in general! Our room was quiet and comfortable, the Inn’s Library and Parlor are wonderfully decorated, and the evening snacks were just right. We stayed 4 nights, and left only because we had to lose weight after the wonderful breakfasts! (And to get back to work!)

We’ll be back!",April 2017,A Williamsburg White House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g58313-d248696-Reviews-A_Williamsburg_White_House-Williamsburg_Virginia.html,"Williamsburg, Virginia",hotels,5.0,5.0
Back to the beginning,"This was the Federal site managed by the National Park Service. We arrived shortly before closing time on Friday, so spent all of our time walking through the original settlement site and the museum. The museum was packed with artifacts excavated in the previous two decades, and was very educational. The site itself had good signage that added to the educational experience. Make sure to get a National Park pass - it's good for Jamestowne, Yorktowne (note the 'e' at the end of each word - the Visitor's Centers run by the Commonwealth of Virginia have their own fee.) and any other National Park.",April 2017,Historic Jamestowne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g58313-d102548-Reviews-Historic_Jamestowne-Williamsburg_Virginia.html,"Williamsburg, Virginia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best food I've had in months!,"Our B&B Innkeeper (John at A Williamsburg White House - see my review!) highly recommended the Fat Canary, and he was right on target! We were fortunate to get in at 7:30 without reservations, as they were using new software. We waited only 5 minutes, got a great table, a great server, quick delivery of two outstanding dishes that were very well composed - salmon and guinea fowl. Full confession - we had dessert, which was also great!
You won't go wrong with any dish on this menu!",April 2017,Fat Canary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58313-d560656-Reviews-Fat_Canary-Williamsburg_Virginia.html,"Williamsburg, Virginia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Slowwww service!,"The ice cream creation tasted good, but it took a loooonnnngggg time and 2 reminders for the 5 of us to get our ice cream. 3 staff members; not too busy, and staff even had time to clean up the empty tables; but we had to flag down the staff to get our food 20 minutes later!",August 2016,A Spoonful Of Sugar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d9561703-Reviews-A_Spoonful_Of_Sugar-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,3.0,4.0
