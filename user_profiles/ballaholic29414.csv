Great food!,This is the best restaurant we went to in Athens. Ive lived in New Orleans for 2 years and this is as close as you'll get to New Orleans food. Drinks are great also and the prices are very affordable.,February 2020,Po' Boys BBQ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d13803455-Reviews-Po_Boys_BBQ-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great view,We went to this place on our food tour and the coffee was great with nice kick. The view was amazing so we came back that night to see the acropolis at night and had a drink. Drink tasted good but didn't have any kick. I highly recommend A for Athens for their coffee and the view,February 2020,A for Athens Cocktail Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2665318-Reviews-A_for_Athens_Cocktail_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0

Fun,We walked down Lombard street it looked exactly like the pictures and was packed with tourist.

Great Atmosphere,"Me and my wife loved this bar. Strong drinks, great music, and great atmosphere. I originally thought that everyone had to pay a cover charge to get in the Tonga room but I found out when I got there you only have to pay cover if you wanted a seat. I didn't plan on eating here I just wanted a drink. Drinks were strong I definitely will be back here during my next visit to San Francisco. It was expensive but all the restaurants and bars were expensive in San Francisco.",February 2019,Tonga Room & Hurricane Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d4097815-Reviews-Tonga_Room_Hurricane_Bar-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,5.0,4.0
Great Fun,My kids 2 and 3 loved this pirate cruise it was very entertaining. We will definitely be back during the summer months. We were running a lil late due to being confused about the location I didn't know they moved so it was a 34min ride vs a 7min ride we expected. They waited on us to get there we definitely will be back,April 2018,Blackbeard's Pirate Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g54371-d8311351-Reviews-Blackbeard_s_Pirate_Cruise-North_Myrtle_Beach_South_Carolina.html,"North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",attractions,5.0,5.0
Nice clean rooms,"Very nice hotel with lots of parking. Only a 10min drive to Darlington Dragway and reasonably priced. Hotel is In a good quiet location, breakfast was great, bathrooms were nice. Overall we were really enjoyed our stay.

Great atmosphere and great food!,I found out about this restaurant on trip advisor so I finally tried it out and it lived up to the hype. The Food did not take long at all to arrive. Band was very good and the food was great. We ended up placing another order to go.,May 2015,Five Sisters Blues Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34550-d1869960-Reviews-Five_Sisters_Blues_Cafe-Pensacola_Florida.html,"Pensacola, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful hotel but.....gun shots,"I love this hotel, you cant beat the quality for the price your paying in downtown new orleans. This hotel is close to everyting, staff was friendly, restaurant inside was GREAT!! and opened 24hrs. Rooms are completely renevated and I saw no signs of age. I gathered the family and I booked 7 rooms at this hotel June 22-26, 2013 (we all stayed on the 3rd floor) and my only issue and huge issue was that on tuesday morning the 25th a lil after 9am I was awaken by guns shots and a guy yelling for help in the room right next to me because he was shot multiple times and bleeding everywhere. I was moved to another room on the 3rd floor. The next night everytime I tried dosing off I kept hearing those gun shots all over again and kept visualising a bloody guy with bullet holes on his body. A incident like this really does seem unusual for a hotel of this caliber. Wyndham simply moved my room to another location and I honestly felt this wasnt enough. We all could have been shot by a stray bullet and I expected wyndam to do more... I would expect this sort of treatment at a motel 6 or days inn.",June 2013,Wyndham Garden Baronne Plaza New Orleans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60864-d215731-Reviews-Wyndham_Garden_Baronne_Plaza_New_Orleans-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",hotels,4.0,4.0
Beats driving and paying for parking,Best way to get around in New Orleans. Its almost impossible to find free parking in Nola so I highly recommend using street cars,June 2013,RTA - Streetcars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60864-d109338-Reviews-RTA_Streetcars-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",attractions,5.0,4.5
New hotel but shows age.,"I first stayed at the paradise resort in May 2007 when it was brand new and I went back may 2013. This is a beatuful hotel but it hasnt been up kept very well. I stayed in room 605 and it had rust on stove,rust in microwave, the bottom of the since enclosure was peeling at the bottom, the bathtub took about 10-15min to drain out after taking a shower, and when we first walked in our room there was a stink smell that came from the bathroom but that went away later that night
(musta been a smelly cleaning agent). Everything else was great, staff was super friendly. Im amazed at how much things has changed in 6 years. Hopefully they are planning to replace or fix the appliances that are showing age...
I was only all guys trip so we didnt really worry about these issues but if I was with my fiance im sure she would of gotten our room switched out, lol.",May 2013,A Piece of Paradise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g54359-d649261-Reviews-A_Piece_of_Paradise-Myrtle_Beach_South_Carolina.html,"Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",hotels,3.0,4.0
I Love this hotel!!,"This is a very nice clean hotel with a beatiful view and friendly staff. 1 of my most favorite this about this hotel besides the view is that theres a trolley that comes to the hotel every 30minutes and it only costed 50 cens per person and it has takes you to all the hot spots in gatlinburg so we didnt have to worry about driving. Im going to book this hotel again next week because im going back to gatlinburg in Sept. The only negative thing that bothered me a lil was the parking at night, it seems like parking could be a issue during prime season in Gatlinburg. This hotel has alot to offer. The cookies we recieved during check in was great and also served warm.",April 2013,Park Vista - DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel - Gatlinburg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60842-d225161-Reviews-Park_Vista_DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_Gatlinburg-Gatlinburg_Tennessee.html,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",hotels,5.0,4.0
Fun place to visit,I liked the fact that we could taste the moonshine for free while listening to the live band and watching them actually cook the moonshine.

So convienient,"Once I found out about the trolley my car did not leave the parking lot until late at night, because the trolley stops at 10pm. Trolley is always on time and is so comfortable and clean. My hotel was a distance from the hot spots in gatlinburg but the trolley came to my hotel front door so that solved that issue.
We even rode the trolley just to see the city.",April 2013,Gatlinburg Trolley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60842-d1600333-Reviews-Gatlinburg_Trolley-Gatlinburg_Tennessee.html,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",attractions,5.0,4.5
