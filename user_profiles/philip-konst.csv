Breathtaking view of Acropolis and most of the Athens,"By mistake I ended up on this hill, thinking it will lead to acropolis! But its even better.
Not a lot of tourists, mostly locals, listening to music and enjoying the sunset.
Great view of one side of Acropolis.
Be careful when climbing, it can be slippery, as we were sitting on the rocks all the way at the end, overlooking the city, and there is no security railing in case you fall down.",March 2019,Philopappos Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d523835-Reviews-Philopappos_Hill-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Incredibly impactful sight to see,"I just love sitting on the hill thats just opposite Acropolis and gazing at this beautiful thousands of years old structure. And just imagining how people used to gather around and walk among those columns 2000+ years ago. Breathtaking!
Be sure to read a bit about the Acropolis itself, how it was built, when, why etc. so you can enjoy it even more!",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Highly recommend,"It was the only restaurant worth visiting there so we went, unsure of what to expect.
First off, service was excellent! They were very attentive and what’s more, professional. Didn’t expect that from a small place in Serbia.
Second, the dishes were just wow. One of the best meals we’ve had in Serbia. Highly recommended.",June 2019,Zlatna Ribica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2238362-d10681864-Reviews-Zlatna_Ribica-Golubac_Central_Serbia.html,"Golubac, Serbia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Busy train station, ability to enjoy wonderful architecture while you wait","It has million entrances, and it can be challenging to find your way around but once you’re in, it’s a lovely place to have a cup of coffee and feel the vibrant energy of people going in and out of the many trains that leave and arrive every few minutes. Beautiful mural of stars on the ceiling about.",May 2019,Grand Central Terminal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d103371-Reviews-Grand_Central_Terminal-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Wonderful experience, helpful information staff","I was super excited to visit the museum, and it ended up being even better than I expected!
The amount of art exhibited and the way it was curated and presented left me speechless. Especially Greek and Egyptian art and sculptures on the ground floor!
Highly recommended.
Btw, by purchasing a ticket (costs $25 plus tax), you get to enter all 3 MET museums in NYC (within 3 days of purchasing the ticket). So make sure the keep the QR code that you get.",May 2019,The Metropolitan Museum of Art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d105125-Reviews-The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,5.0
Mouth watering steak!,"Nice ambiance, nice lighting...very dim and private.
The food was amazing, live kitchen makes you want to try something.
Drinks were good as well, decently priced for such place.

Beyond expectations!!,"We were on our honeymoon a month back, and I cannot stress enough how amazing the experience of the hotel was.
Beautiful amenities, room overlooking the main road, the pool was very relaxing etc.
But the highlight of the stay was the staff that exceeded our expectations!
We remember Adnan from the reception who helped us organize our entire stay, made sure we had everything waiting for us in the room, and gave us great recommendations about the city tours and what to see. We are so grateful to him and once we’re back to dubai we will be staying at Nassima again for sure! Big thanks for the whole team!",April 2018,voco Dubai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d1990762-Reviews-Voco_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,4.5
