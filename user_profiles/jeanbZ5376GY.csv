Love to shop?,"Then you’ll love the Plaka. Lots of stores, many sell8ng the same things, but still fun. Streets are narrow and of stone, so wear comfortable shoes.

Amazing!,"I didn’t think I would be so impressed, but I was wrong. The beauty of what remains is astounding. To think these structures have survived wars, earthquakes, and millions of tourists! We went in October when the crowds were smaller and the weather was perfect. Beware it is a bit of a climb, so wear comfortable shoes and take your time.

Centrally Located Gem,"The hotel is very close to the essential sights in Athens: the Acropolis, the Parthenon, the Acropolis Archeological Museum, the Plaka for shopping, and Syntagma Square, where the changing of the guard takes place. Loads of good restaurants nearby. The service at the hotel was excellent and breakfast was delicious. There is a wine bar and restaurant directly in front of Inn Athens.

Small but comfortable,"The hotel has a spacious lobby and breakfast room with a terrace. The breakfast was delicious. Our room was small but comfortable and very clean.

Short stay,"Tried the hotel again. The room was better, not roomy but adequate. The web site said they allow dogs. Got there and they said no dog until I showed the desk manager the web site. Sooo, maybe they do or not. They did allow me to stay with the dog for a fee.",August 2019,La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Brooklyn Downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60827-d1657771-Reviews-La_Quinta_Inn_Suites_by_Wyndham_Brooklyn_Downtown-Brooklyn_New_York.html,"Brooklyn, New York",hotels,3.0,3.5
"Reliable, direct, on time!",I always try to fly JetBlue because flightsY are direct to JFK and are on time. I do pay more for more leg room. It makes a big difference getting in and out of the row. The attendants do their job s efficiently but are not that friendly. I don’t really care about that.

Convenient Location,"Houston is a big, busy city, but the downtown area is easily accessible especially if you stay at the Hampton Inn.

BBQ Without the Line,"Rudy’s always has good BBQ especially when you’re on the way home and don’t feel like cooking. The brisket is moist and tender, the sausage spicy, and the ribs are succulent.

Tapas and wine!,"Tasty tapas especially the capers sandwich, bruschetta with mushrooms and cheese, pulled pork sliders, and the green salad wit spring peas. Good selection of wines to accompany the tapas. Go into their charming garden and enjoy your wine.

Can’t keep it a secret,"I shouldn’t be writing this because it’s a small restaurant, and you might make the line longer! Yes, there’s a line most nights but it moves quickly and better during the week. This is the best ramen I’ve had, said even after a recent trip to Japan. The broth has been cooked low and slow to develop deep rich flavor. Then fresh ramen, vegetables, a little pork or not, and an egg are slipped in. Great flavors combine to create a warm, satisfying soup. A lot of slurping going on at Ramen Tatsu-Ya but totally expected and acceptable. Good Japanese beer too. The restaurant is in a small shopping center on Research Blvd. Maybe you won’t find it but you can imagine me happily slurping away. Just kidding....give it a try!",October 2017,Ramen Tatsu-Ya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g30196-d4059026-Reviews-Ramen_Tatsu_Ya-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Baseball Fans Nirvana,"Every baseball fan has to visit the Hall of Fame! Every team is adequately represented, but the stars are prominently featured.

Quintessential Austin,"Great Mexican food rather than Tex-Mex. I've eaten here twice and loved the drinks, food, and service. The restaurant offers a variety of margaritas but try the mojitos too. I recommend the chicken mole and rellenos. Other members of our party enjoyed the fish and shrimp dishes as well. The waiters are knowledgeable and happy to recommend dishes especially for those diners who do not enjoy spicy food.

Concert Venue,"Unfortunately, it's quite a distance from Austin, traffic is often terrible. There is plenty of parking and shuttles from the lots.
