Surprise,This bar and grill was recommended by the hotel we were staying out. The venue has been recently renovated so it is a very pleasant – clean and fresh. The menu offers a good range especially with the additional Greek based dishes. The food was well presented and tasty and represented value for money. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

Great Stopover,Booked this hotel because we wanted the unique experience of sleeping in an underground hotel and we were not disappointed. The room was every well presented with a great ensuite.

City Stop Over,"A really pleasant experience. The room, as was the hotel in general, was bright well maintained and well presented. All the staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful, well all aside one - the gentlemen who supervised the entrance. He completely failed to appreciate that one has to load suitcases into a car and therefore parking is required, simply saying you can't park here is not at all helpful especially when surrounded by city traffic. The bugger lunch special at Eve's restaurant was great and represented real value for a little money given Melbourne lunch time prices.

Very Disappointing,"Reads well but that’s where it stops. The room we had was tired and in desperate need of an upgrade - things like the chunky aircon unit the faded tired wood work and worst of all no shower pressure. The new areas appeared to fit with the promotional material but if you are in the older part then I think like us you will be disappointed. We are so glad this was only a short stay.
Staff very friendly but this could not compensate for the outdated tired room.",January 2020,Pacific Bay Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255059-d296725-Reviews-Pacific_Bay_Resort-Coffs_Harbour_New_South_Wales.html,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",hotels,3.0,3.5
Passing through Toowoomba,"Booked this accommodation as we were passing through. The Platinum International is well appointed and a very pleasant place to stay.

Absolutely Wonderful,"Fantastic B&B as it sets a standard other B&Bs should achieve. Meryl and Phil make you feel special. The rooms are cossy, interesting and just very pleasant to spend time in.

Soggy chips and chewy steak,"Sorry guys, after reading the reviews we were excited about eating here but sadly were totally disappointed.. The entree - oysters Kirkpatrick were extremely disappointing as it was simply oyster swimming in Worcester sauce, in fact drowning would be a more apt descriptor. The steak which formed part of the surf and turf was dry and chewy whist the chips for both mains where cold and soggy. The black snapper and bbq prawns were actually quiet good, aside the chips, and if the other surf and turf main had matched that it would have been a much better dinning experience. The plus was the service but that could not make up for the food so we will not be back.",January 2020,Surf Club Restaurant & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255059-d2350827-Reviews-Surf_Club_Restaurant_Bar-Coffs_Harbour_New_South_Wales.html,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",restaurants,2.0,4.0
A delightful stay,"This is indeed a cosy place to stay. From the minute you arrive you are made to feel welcome. The house has a lovely feel to it. The fact that breakfast and dinner are part of the package that we had meant that all the big decisions were made. The dinner menu over the three days we were there changed every night, so now worries about having to choose the same thing because of a lack of choice. The menu is adaptive to gluten free requirements and the young staff are well across the issue. The host and his staff go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your dinning experience and the chief goes that step further to ensure you have a fine dinning experience. Likewise with breakfast, variety, freshness and friendly service characterised the start to the day.
This was a totally relaxing and positive experience as the host,hostess and staff go out of their way to provide an excellent service.",October 2019,Mount Pleasant Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190743-d1863582-Reviews-Mount_Pleasant_Hotel-Sidmouth_Devon_England.html,"Sidmouth, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,5.0
First impression,"Don’t let first impressions put you off for I nearly fell into that trap. Don’t get me wrong the room we had was very basic /plain and the bed certainly is due to be replaced. But, that said, it was clean, functional and everything worked. Now to the real plus, the friendliness of the staff. I kid you not for the three days that we stayed at the Navigator the staff were always positive, helpful with absolutely nothing being too much trouble. The atmosphere in the Inn itself is delightful as it is a local and with so many regulars dropping in it has a wonderful positive feel. The meals both breakfast and dinner were very good with the staff and the chief going that little bit further to accommodate a gluten free diet. The evening menu offers a good range of choice and is certainly not just your basic pub food but rather a significant step up. The portion size is very generous, well prepared and presented. Likewise breakfast is very enjoyable and you certainly will not go hungry if you opt for the traditional English breakfast. We absolutely enjoyed the atmosphere of being part of this local Inn and being made to fell so welcome.",October 2019,Navigator Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g504216-d587342-Reviews-Navigator_Hotel-Bognor_Regis_Arun_District_West_Sussex_England.html,"Bognor Regis, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
What a Gem,"The level of service and the food is amazing. Adam and his staff really do provide you with a fine dinning experience. This restaurant is definitely off the beaten track but we did learn that if you are in the area they do offer a free taxi service so check this out. The menu is extremely diverse offering interesting choices which a beautifully cooked, prepared and presented. The menu is adaptive to cater for gluten intolerance which is a major plus. The gin glazed salmon entree is very delicious as was my duck main.

Pot luck,"Went here based on trip advisor and so pleased we did. We were in the market for a quick lunch but still wanted something tasty and good. We certainly were not disappointed, the service was excellent with the waitress was very happy to assist with not only menu questions but general tourist questions as well. The Drouthy
Laird has recently been refurbished so it has a fresh and bright feel to the place. The food we had, burger and a grilled haddock was really good, in fact the burger was one of the best I have had in a Scottish/English pub.

A most enjoyable lunch,A most enjoyable lunch. Great menu served by a helpful and positive staff. Dropped in looking for a pub lunch and were pleased we did. The menu is not your traditional English pub fare but there is a good variety of options to choose from and the menu does provide non-gluten options. The steaks are served on a sizzling plata so if you are hungry that is a good option.

Wonderful stay,"John and Rhoda were the perfect host and hostess. Everything was as you would expect when booking a B&B, from the friendly greeting, the positive help to the great morning breakfast. The room was charming, very clean and well presented as was the rest of the guest areas. John is positive and engaging endeavouring to make sure you enjoy your stay, but that is not to say they are not a great team and they make it work so as to ensure you have a delightful stay. Did I say the breakfast were fantastic, well it was. John and Rhoda go out of there way to add a personal touch to your stay. Absolutely recommend this B&B if you are in the area.

Great seafood,This was a very positive and enjoyable dining experience noting that it is slightly more expensive than most restaurants in town. They provide and cater for gluten-free and their menu is adaptive to ensure person suffering from a gluten intolerance will have an enjoyable meal and evening. Service was fantastic and nothing was too much trouble especially when it came to selecting the wine. The dress crab and lobster was most enjoyable is well worth a try. Given the popularity of this restaurant it is important to book before hand.The restaurant also has an excellent gin selection should you be so inclined.,September 2019,Wells Crab House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315941-d1605260-Reviews-Wells_Crab_House-Wells_next_the_Sea_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Wells-next-the-Sea, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Most enjoyable,The pub on the corner which is very popular and rightly so because they serve a good fare. We went there for dinner and found the food and the serving staff to be excellent. Importantly the golden fleece caters for gluten-free and has an understanding of how to adapt dishes to ensure a person suffering from gluten tolerance have an enjoyable dining experience. The menu offers both seafood and non seafood options to ensure there is enough variety for you to find something that you will like. Again the big plus was the friendliness of the staff and their commitment to ensuring you had a good dining experience.,September 2019,The Golden Fleece,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315941-d6628870-Reviews-The_Golden_Fleece-Wells_next_the_Sea_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Wells-next-the-Sea, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Popped in,Popped in for lunch and was pleased we did so. Whilst the restaurant is not by the sea but at the top end of Staithe street it is a very pleasant walk from the port up through the village shopping area to reach the restaurant. The venue is exceptionally well presented and the staff are positive and enthusiastic. The menu options provide a good variety and this restaurant will cater for gluten intolerance adapting the dish if necessary. It is a cozy place to sit enjoy your meal and a glass of wine; play one of the games that are available and let the afternoon pass you by.,September 2019,Bang In Wells,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315941-d8277193-Reviews-Bang_In_Wells-Wells_next_the_Sea_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Wells-next-the-Sea, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Most enjoyable,"Great location by the quay however it means parking is an issue. The room on the third floor was great. Freshly refurbished, comfortable and with a view of the quay. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, nothing was too much bother. Cosy and comfortable with a bit of old world Harbourside pub charm. Dining in in their restaurant is also a positive option. The menu caters for gluten intolerance an offers a good variety.

Not what was expected!,"Alison and Andy were very friendly and responsive to requests. The location was perfect as it was just a walk down the hill into the old part of town giving you good access to restaurants and the quay.
The room was quite a surprise in terms of the decor; the sofa and chair were not particularly comfortable and in my view had moved well past their best as had the additional single bed which just didn’t seem to belong in the room.The ensuite was a built-in affair which was incredibly pokey and small. The shower was very small and for a tall person it was quite uncomfortable to have a shower. The master bed was uncomfortable as I assess the mattress had moved well past its best and certainly needs to be replaced. I am sorry but from my experience I could not in all conscience rate this as a four star guest residence. Maybe my Australian background doesn’t quite fit with what is to be expected in the UK, that said, I would certainly expect in a four star rated residence for the ensuite to be more than just a small cubicle that has been added into a room.
Another disappointing factor was the non-acceptance of credit cards as this fact was not advertised in the information about the property. As a tourist accessing cash is not necessarily always easy and / or convenient given exchange rates etc.",September 2019,Seacrest Guesthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186345-d1154947-Reviews-Seacrest_Guesthouse-Whitby_Scarborough_District_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"Whitby, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.5

Great location to visit Bamburgh Castle,Impressed with the positive attitude of the staff and friendly atmosphere. The location is excellent for viewing the castle or just taking a walk on the beach. You do need to be careful with what room you book as the rooms on the third floor are very small. We were disappointed with our initial room so we opted to upgrade. The breakfast was very enjoyable with a good menu options also the buffet offers plenty of variety. It is however important to book a table both at the hotel and at any of the other restaurants if you don’t intend to eat at the hotel or one of the other restaurants in town. In fact I recommend you book these restaurants well in advance of your arrival..,September 2019,The Victoria Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g504035-d251675-Reviews-The_Victoria_Hotel-Bamburgh_Northumberland_England.html,"Bamburgh, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Disappointing,"Whilst the staff were attentive and friendly the experience here was betrayed by the food when it arrived.
The veal schnitzel was unfortunately very oily which permeated through into the chicken. The other ordered dish, a bouillabaisse had great potential as the seafood which forms the basis of this dish was very fresh but alas there was very little of it, as most of the dish was taken up with 4 large potatoes. Based on the dishes we had we would certainly not go back and therefore we struggle to recommend this inn as a good place to dine.",September 2019,The Captain's Table at the Ship Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g793710-d1422376-Reviews-The_Captain_s_Table_at_the_Ship_Inn-Stonehaven_Aberdeenshire_Scotland.html,"Stonehaven, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Room selection is important,"The first room we were offered on the second floor was exceptionally basic. Yes, it was clean but that is all I can say for it. The bathroom was old and tired with the evidence of mould / damp on the walls. Thankfully we were able to obtain a room change. The second room was a vast improvement having recently been renovated and was more in keeping with the promotional material.
Critically no access and then very limited access to wifi. Many apologies about it being fix but no resolution. Wifi for international travellers is critical and in this day and age given what you pay for a room it is a service that should work.
The staff are positive and helpful and certainly make you feel welcome. The dinning experience in the restaurant was very enjoyable and a very pleasant dining experience. The menu provided good options and also catered for gluten free.",October 2019,Friars Carse Country House Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1096499-d279714-Reviews-Friars_Carse_Country_House_Hotel-Auldgirth_Dumfries_Dumfries_and_Galloway_Scotland.html,"Auldgirth, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
A good option,A very enjoyable dinning experience due to the friendly helpful staff and the good quality of the food; beit seafood or a steak. The scallops are in our view an absolute must. The fish of the day is also worth a try. A dish we did not try but certainly looked fantastic is the seafood platter. We would have loved to give it a try but it just looked toooo big. Suggest if you go this option arrive at the restaurant hungry. The most important thing to do re this restaurant is to book well in advance of your arrival otherwise you will struggle getting a table.,October 2019,Cuchullin Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551883-d10263818-Reviews-Cuchullin_Restaurant-Portree_Isle_of_Skye_The_Hebrides_Scotland.html,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Room with a continental breakfast,"The location is just perfect if you want to be right by the harbour but it makes parking a challenge even given the availability of paid parking.
The Quay is listed as a B&B but I fear it is very different to my understanding of a B&B the the general guide of what to expect when you stay in a B&B. The room itself was very pokey and certainly did not match the picture image. General cleanliness of the place - carpets - rather surprised at the state especially as pets are allowed in the rooms. The en-suite was very small and pokey making it uncomfortable to use. I certainly did not see this as a B&B in terms of the service and that little bit extra that you expect over and above a hotel, in fact it offered less than your average hotel room in terms of room service and amenities. Given you are paying for a B&B experience you would expect something more than just a room with continental breakfast included.",September 2019,The Quay B&B,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315941-d11909828-Reviews-The_Quay_B_B-Wells_next_the_Sea_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Wells-next-the-Sea, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.5

We were driving past looking for somewhere to eat so we asked a local who recommended this restaurant in a town just further on. We are so glad we took this recommendation. Location is down by the harbour- a little bit of a challenge to get to if you don’t know the area but it is worth the trouble. The staff were exceptionally friendly and very accommodating to adapt the menu to accommodate gluten intolerance.

Taking a longer break,"We stayed here for three days to give us time to slow down a bit. The most striking aspect of our stay was the friendliness and positive attitude of the staff. The rooms are well presented,functional and clean, but the walls are paper thin and if you are not on the top floor you certainly know what the occupants above you are up to especially if they get in late or rise early. Breakfast buffet was good although the warm dishes from the bain marie tended to be cool especially if you ate breakfast around 9 o’clock. Pool is excellent so remember to pack bathers.

Disappointing,Location is good being in the town centre facing the harbour but this does of course bring the inevitable parking problem. Sadly the hotel has moved well past its prime .. it’s simply tired and this is reflected everywhere. The rooms themselves are very tired and in desperate need of refurbishment. The staff are friendly and helpful. However the general atmosphere of the rooms and the hotel in general is one of being worn out; if only the room looked as fresh as the ones on the web page. If you are planning a stay in Portree is is important to precook restaurants otherwise you could find yourself with no where to eat. Would have been great if the hotel had told us this at the time we booked.,October 2019,The Royal Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g551883-d254005-Reviews-The_Royal_Hotel-Portree_Isle_of_Skye_The_Hebrides_Scotland.html,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,3.5
‘Just Brilliant’,"Gunton arms is located near Cromer, Norfolk, so you really have to plan a trip to this restaurant - but trust me it is well worth the effort. The Gunton Arms is located in the grounds of Gunton Hall. We were fortunate enough to sit right next to the large cooking fire and therefore we are able to engage in an interesting conversations with Andy aka Stuart as he prepared our meal. I have to say without hesitation the steak cooked on the open fire was by far the best I’ve had in the UK. The pork chop also cooked on the open fire, with apple sauce was equally as good . The potatoes cooked in goose fat was a brilliant accompaniment. All we can say is if you are in the area then this is a dining experience not to be missed. We are so pleased that we went out of our way to ensure that we went to The Gunton Arms, and recommend you do the same. We would also suggest that you take the precaution of making a reservation so as to ensure you are not disappointed.

Pub lunch,"A great pub venue just outside the cathedral. The food was very enjoyable and once order came relatively quickly, getting the order in was a bit more of a challenge as the pub was quite busy and the wait staff appeared somewhat overwhelmed. The menu offered a good variety and certainly catered for gluten intolerance; the staff were also across this issue which is always a plus. The twice backed cheese soufflé makes a great starter. Plenty of interesting choice with the mains but the steak is always a good fall back. Sitting in the front of the pub offers a great atmosphere- as you can look out onto the lane.

Definitely only an overnight stop,"Overall the hotel looked tired particularly the corridors and lift areas. The staff were not particularly friendly or helpful. There certainly appear to be confusion over how one should be treated if you have already paid, asking for a security deposit sent totally inappropriate. Being woken at one in the morning by a fire alarm set off because someone was smoking in the room clearly indicates that there is ineffective communication between staff and hotel guests. The hotel staff simply brushed it off as an unfortunate occurrence which doesn’t help when you have to get up again at 4:30 in the morning for an early flight.

Renewing and old Acquaintance,"It has been some time since we have been to Paymasters and we are so pleased we opted to go back. The food and service was simply the best – friendly, inviting and in terms of the food great. The menu offers a great choice and caters for gluten free without compromise on taste and flavours, which is a great plus. The pan-fried scallops with a romesco sauce were exceptional and we really do recommend you tried this entrée if scallops are your thing. As for mains we both opted for the Duck and Lychee curry – and what a great choice.

Overnight stop,Great place for an overnight stop. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room is practical and tasteful. But the big win was the restaurant 579 Olive street - what a surprise. The food and service was excellent. If you are in Albury and looking for a great place to dine with interesting dishes then I recommend you check 579 out. The menu also caters for gluten free so that is a real bonus.,July 2019,Mercure Albury,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255314-d255419-Reviews-Mercure_Albury-Albury_New_South_Wales.html,"Albury, Australia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Passing through,"Booked this motel based on the reviews it had received and we were so glad that we did. The Motel is modern, bright, clean and fresh and is well suited for that one night stopover or even longer. The rooms are well appointed and have everything you will need in terms of making that cup of coffee, storing food items in the bar fridge etc. The location is ideal - next-door to the Services Club where you are guaranteed to find something you will like to eat. We were so impressed with the overall quality of this motel that we booked it for our return trip and we certainly will have no hesitation in staying there again. It will in fact be our first preference.

Fantastic romantic getaway spot,"Bli Bli House is an ideal venue for that romantic or quiet getaway. It's location is such that there are things to see and do or you can just spend time in the well appointed cosy room and just chillax. The breakfast is absolutely wonderful, there is absolutely no shortage of options, everything is fresh and beautifully presented. The cooked breakfast is a delight and if you are staying a few days we recommend you work your way through all of the options provided.

Return visit after many years,"A most enjoyable and positive dinning experience. It has been many years since we have eaten here and we are pleased to say - it was just as good as we remembered it.

Disappointing Dinning experience,A very disappointing dinning experience as both the food and service was average but the prices were certainly not.

Overnight stop over,A most pleasant surprise. Needed one nights accommodation as we passed through Bairnsdale and this was a great option. Obviously being reasonably new the rooms were well presented but it was pleasing to note they were also well prepared.

Quick bite to eat,"On the road and so we were just passing through Inverlock, looking for a place to have lunch. We stopped and asked a local for a recommendation on a place to get a good lunch - value for money. He recommended both of the local pubs so we opted for The Inlet and we were not disappointed. The hotel catered for gluten free which was a huge plus especially as the steak sandwich was also available as a gluten free dish. Service and friendliness of the staff was also a plus given that we hit this place at the height of the tourist season.

QUICK STOP OVER,"Everything about this hotel was great except for the white noice coming from the elevator which completely ruined the experience. We had Room 108b which backs onto the elevator shaft so all night you could hear either hear the elevator or the electric fans atop the elevator humming. Of course we didn’t realize this until we turned the tv off and then it was too late to complain.
We book through hotels.com rather than direct and therefore can’t help feel we got the least desirable room in the hotel. We were so put off by this experience that we did not rebook for the return trip. All I can suggest if you are booking this hotel make sure you ask that your room is located away from the elevators.",December 2018,The Esplanade Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255354-d966144-Reviews-The_Esplanade_Resort_Spa-Lakes_Entrance_Gippsland_Victoria.html,"Lakes Entrance, Australia",hotels,3.0,3.5
Long lunch,"The restaurant is located on the Syntagma Square - an ideal location to sit and watch the day go by particularly after spending a morning see the sights. The staff are very friendly and will endeavour to accommodate dietary requirements such as a gluten intolerance. There is a good variety of dishes so plenty to choose from.

Not what I expected - Sofitel,"Reception very disappointing as a club member no priority system in operation contrary to the stated benefit to be offered to members.
Service in the lounge is incredibly disorganized and incredibly slow.
Aside the reception area, the lounge and restaurant which are bright and fresh the hallways and rooms are tired, especially the hallway carpets. Not what I expected to find at a Sofitel.

Eat with the locals,"This is definitely a locals traverna - and if you are into sea food then you are assured of a very enjoyable dinning experience. We were there the evening of a rather large local family get together but this did not impact on the quality and friendliness of the service. The food is great and the serves are very very generous - try the mini serves of mussels and you will see - it surpasses most restaurants normal serves. As with all things sea food it can get expensive very quickly, but the prices here were in keeping with what was being served, obviously the more exotic the more expensive as per any restaurant but in my opinion still cheaper than most.
So if you are down checking out Poseidon’s temple and you are into sea food you might want to give this traverna a go.",August 2018,Theodoros & Eleni Fish Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g12294876-d10962079-Reviews-Theodoros_Eleni_Fish_Tavern-Legrena_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Legrena, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
What a pleasant surprise!,"Cafe Zeus is at the other end of town, that is, you have to drive passed it to get to the entrance to the archaelogical of Olympia, but I can assure you it’s worth going back. Why?
The food and choices are great and the service is very very good. The staff completely understand the issues relating to gluten intolerance and will if possible alter dishes to ensure it is gluten free. Alex, who just happen to be a Greek Australian, went the extra nine yards to ensure everything we selected was gluten free so as to ensure we had a great lunch experience. I can personally recommend the Caesar salad as a good lunch option.
Don’t be put off by the fact that is not near the entrance to the attraction do some backtracking for I’m sure you will have an enjoyable lunch.",August 2018,Zeys Restaurant - cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189487-d7755253-Reviews-Zeys_Restaurant_cafe-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
“Very Basic hotel accommodation”,"The big plus for this hotel is the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to help.

The room was very basic which is fine if it bright and cheerful as opposed to tired. The bathroom however was another issue - very small and poky and I mean poky with no external ventilation or an exhaust fan. In Greece with an average summer temperature above 30 degrees C and the toilet issues - no flushing of toilet paper an exhaust fan / external ventilation in my view is a must. The underground parkinging is a real challenge if you have a medium size car and in reality is a very neglected basement area not what one would consider really set out to accommodate parking.

“Lovely location but the hotel needs to lift its game”,"Location - The hotel is ideally placed if you want to access the Temple of Poseidon.

The rooms whilst recently renovated just looked like a quick make over. The front door and entrance for example to the room was a steal door with marine ply steps! The bathroom was very impractical particular in terms of using the shower - height restriction meant for a tall person it was almost impossible.The bathroom had no exhaust fan - given the heat and the fact that you can't flush paper - not a good combination.

Looking for a relaxing stopover in this northern part of Greece, located south of Thessaloniki, then this resort is in my view a great option. The resort is well appointed but you can read all that from the resorts own site. What is impressive is the friendliness of the staff, the relaxed atmosphere and the attentive service. The buffet breakfast and dinners are a positive dining experience and the oppose to what you expect when told dinner and breakfast are a buffet.

Going a little local.,"The menu offers a great variety so you will not be short on choices BUT don't order too much as the servings are very generous. The seafood is delightful and in most instances is fresh, you do need to check however. The house wine is a real steal and we can only recommend it - don't waste your money - go the house wine. The staff are an absolute delight, positive and very helpful, they will in fact advise you that you are more than likely ordering too much. Can you believe that!!

What a delight!,"The inn is located in the Syntagma Square, so you are there right in the heart of the old town of Nafplio. We found this inn to be a delight and we certain enjoyed our six day stay. The room was charming - well appointed and very comfortable. Given the duration of our stay we were very fortunate to have the room with the large balcony, room 206 (I think). If you are there for a long stay then I recommend you request this room, as sitting on the balcony in the evening overlooking the square is indeed very enjoyable and relaxing. The room was as detailed in the advertisement and was very comfortable. The friendliness and positive commitment on the part of the staff to make sure you enjoyed your stay was refreshing and a very positive aspect of our stay. The breakfast served at the Zenon Cafe (just downstairs) was excellent. Again the staff went out of their way to provide great service especially when dealing with special dietary requirements. We ate a number of our evening meals at the cafe not only because of it close proximity to our room but because of the outlook over the square and the overall quality of the food and service made it such an enjoyable experience. Being located in the old part of Nafplio also brings with it a certain charm - especially seeing the children playing each evening in the square.",September 2018,Xenon Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g319780-d1833144-Reviews-Xenon_Inn-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
