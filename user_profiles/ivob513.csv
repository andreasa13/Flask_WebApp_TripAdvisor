Below average,"Staying for 10 days due to Covid travel restrictions.
Accommodation very low standard. Old, should be renewed in many aspects. No hangers in room cabinets. Room cleanliness 3/10, window curtains in yellow, room cannot get dark. Doors now properly tight, can hear people from other rooms and corridors. Room service called me in the morning around 8am , although they were advised not to call me in rest hours.

Good place to book if in Athens,"Hotel is located almost in centre of Athens, even you can walk to Sintagma square, or you take a taxi, will cost 4-5 eur.
Hotel staff friendly, rooms are comfortable, clean, sound proof. Only thing what was little dissapointing in this kind of hotel is that I booked Exectutive room, but the room was average in matter od sq meters, probably like basic/standard room. Maybe the hotel staff should make better photos of each kind of room, so the guest would see excatly how the room look like.
