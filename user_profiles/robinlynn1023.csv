Favorite!,"This is our new obsession. We've been going here weekly for over a year now. The chef offers a fresh taste of Mexican food in an upscale, beautifully decorated environment. The staff's service is beyond amazing. They are all super attentive. I love how they change the menu seasonally. Margaritas are great-not too sweet, and they have a great mezcal menu as well. There is nothing I don't like about this place.

Great for romantic, business, or special occasion dinners.",February 2020,Jalisco Norte,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55711-d13218193-Reviews-Jalisco_Norte-Dallas_Texas.html,"Dallas, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Artistic!,"The food here is amazing. GF & vegan dietary restrictions can be accommodated. On top of everything being delicious, it is well presented and artistically plated.

Great Site!,You are able to tour the ruins on your own. You don't have to get any of the tour guides at the entrance to help you.

They were so accommodating since we were just walk-ins on a Sunday. We booked a foot ,assuage and it included leg stretches, headmaster neck, upper body massage as well. We were amazed.

You won’t get in in a large group. We dressed sexy. Plan to strip to your level of comfort upon arrival and check your things. You won’t get your phone in either.

We explored the many rooms. Since they are smaller, the sound system is a tad harsh, so bring your ear plugs. The bar lines weren’t too bad even though it was a crowded night.

If you are open to ""things"" happening, you can find it here, but no one is creepy and no one ever made me feel unsafe.

Their sound system is exquisite and extremely well balanced. Of course it’s loud, so bring you ear plugs, but you aren’t going to be in pain like you are some other venues.

We attempted to go in twice and we made it in twice. We dress in black all the time anyway, and our style is more mature stylish goth/punk.

Did Not Exceed Expectations,"We made a reservation at Maceo for my husband try their vegan options.

The place is beautiful and more old-school fine dining. The Maitre d was expectedly pretentious, which was fine and funny at the same time.

My husband ordered the vegan ""caviar"" which was lentils with a fig sauce. Not very creative. My friend and I ordered the duck. It was ""ok."" ....just ok. Our friend also had the foie gras and said it was very good.

They do have a nice wine selection and the sommelier was quite helpful and not snooty.

EXCELLENT Brunch Selection,"I found this restaurant on Happy Cow. I had to call to get a brunch reservation and that was slightly difficult, but it was totally worth the effort.

Viasko is a vegan restaurant that offers an amazing brunch buffet on Saturday and Sunday. We went on a Saturday and my husband was elated that he could participate fully in brunch with me for the very first time. (We don't have many vegan restaurants in Dallas, TX)

The building is really cool and the clientele appeared to be the more creative types....which is our circle of friends back home.

The buffet items were not typical and too many to list. There was not one item on the buffet that was mediocre. Between the two of us, we tried just about all of them.

I highly recommend Viasko's brunch. Make the effort/make the call for the reservation. There is a long line to get in, so be sure you get a seat.",September 2015,Viasko,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d2062950-Reviews-Viasko-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Amazing Visit,"When you visit Amsterdam, you must go to Rijksmuseum. We were going to do the Van Gogh museum, but the lines were too long. We were able to get into Rijksmuseum quickly.

There is simply too much to talk about and you won't see it all in a single visit. If you go, pay attention to the architecture. It is as much art as anything displayed in the museum. Add this to your ""Must Do List.""",September 2015,Rijksmuseum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d189379-Reviews-Rijksmuseum-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
Mediocre,"My husband is vegan. On this trip, my goal was to do fine dining at vegan restaurants.

Il Margutta had a fixed price vegan menu. It sounded wonderful. It was mediocre. I expected more for 50 Euros per person. Most courses needed salt and an acid profile added to them. Any salt at all. My husband's take on our dinner was, ""This is what vegetarians think vegans eat.""

We made a reservation the night they had an art show in full swing. (we weren't aware until we arrived) The art was wonderful. The music was too loud and all over the place. Voices were loud and carried due to the acoustics of the place. Service was slow.....slower than usual in Europe. I'm ok with taking hours to have several courses, but this was ridiculously slow and un-attentive.",September 2015,Il Margutta veggy food & art,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d787973-Reviews-Il_Margutta_veggy_food_art-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,2.0,4.0
AMAZING Food and Excellent Service,"I made a reservation weeks before our trip to visit Lucky Leek. The reservation process was super easy.

We arrived a little early for our reservation; the staff was quite accommodating. We had no trouble with the staff understanding English and communicating in English.

We chose the 3 course fixed price dinner with the wine pairing. Our server was informative and knowledgeable. The wine pairings were perfect with each course. Servings we ample. The flavor profile of each dish was exquisite. There was so much going on in each bite. The plating was a spectacular feast for the eyes. Each course was artfully displayed.

My husband has been vegan for 23 years. Watching his face with each bite and each sip of each wine was worth whatever the cost of this evening was. (it was reasonable for the level of dining experienced) He finally understood why I enjoy fine dining.

We will definitely visit Lucky Leek again and do the 5 course menu next time.",September 2015,Lucky Leek,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d2403217-Reviews-Lucky_Leek-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Quirky & Fun,"We visited King's Pub twice on our 4 day trip. The decor is quirky and wonderfully dated. The space around the bar is tight and the staff couldn't be nicer.

We loved listening to the 50's American music blair throughout the pub.

Definitely one of our favorite places on the trip.",September 2015,King's Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d3428198-Reviews-King_s_Pub-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,5.0,3.5
Worst Tour Ever,"AVOID this tour bus like the plague! Disorganized, RUDE, overpacked, windows inside are covered with their logo so you can't see out, no AC. Busses take FOREVER to show.

Amin was the worst as well. He was the guy headed the cattle onto each bus.

We wasted an hour of our time waiting for the next bus that only had seats covered by logos available.",September 2015,I Love Roma Tours - Private Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d2536650-Reviews-I_Love_Roma_Tours_Private_Tours-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,1.0,2.0
