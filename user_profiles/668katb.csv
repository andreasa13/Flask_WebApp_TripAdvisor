Good value for money,"I would probably rate this restaurant a 3.5/5. The concept is brilliant and for Â£29 the dishes were of good value. I was a little disappointed that two of the meals were not warm enough (room temperature), and the pasta course was rather tasteless. The lemon tart was my favourite.",September 2020,Six by Nico,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186337-d19418223-Reviews-Six_by_Nico-Liverpool_Merseyside_England.html,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Nice food and friendly service,"I would probably rate this a 3.5/5. I had a meal here on a Saturday night with two friends. The lady working as front of house was very friendly and informative. The food was also really nice, but we were disappointed with how spaced out in time the different dishes were. I understand that all dishes won't come together, but there was a 1 hour difference between when the first and last dish arrived (we were only a table of 3). I've not had this issue when visiting Maray on the Docks.",September 2020,Maray,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186337-d7006716-Reviews-Maray-Liverpool_Merseyside_England.html,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great place,This restaurant was right next to our hotel and we ended up visiting it 3 times during our 1 week stay in NYC (once for dinner and twice for drinks and a small bite to eat during the daytime).

2 night stay at the Lakes,"There was nothing wrong with the hotel, but for what we paid I would say the value is average. The room was clean, but both my husband and I felt like the room didnât resemble the online hotel pictures. We staid in room 28 and it was nowhere near as modern as the pictures suggested online.

"OK food, but I would not return","The food tasted ok and the staff were relatively friendly, but unfortunately there were a few things I was not happy with. Firstly, our burger and pizza arrived 6 minutes after ordering which to me implies the food is not as fresh as it should be. Secondly, all the waitresses were wearing their masks below their nose.

Romantic Meal,"Had a lovely meal here mid-week. The service was excellent and the food lovely. Good precautions were also in place for COVID-19. The only reason am scoring this a 4 rather than a 5 is because unfortunately the coconut & white chocolate parfait had no flavour to it (I think it was stored in a fridge that was too cold as the texture felt a little frozen, and this might have affected the flavour).
