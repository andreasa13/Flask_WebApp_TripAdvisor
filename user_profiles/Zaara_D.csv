Good food but lousy service,"The lady at the front counter was so chirpy and friendly, I had better expectations from service. But was left disappointed. Very lethargic and inattentive servers.

"Quiet, clean, conveniently located","I stayed at La Comtesse between 12/15-12/19 in room 307. It is conveniently located in the 7th arrondisement, 10 minutes from the Eiffel. Its less than 30 minutes walking distance from here to almost all major attractions; Champs Elysee, Louvre, Musee Orsay, Musee Rodin... Musee D L'Armee is just down the street. Some really good restaurants are within walking distance and the neighborhood itself is uber safe. I - a solo female- walked around the neighborhood as late as 11PM. The area has embassies and government buildings so it always well guarded. The hotel is across from the Ecole Militaire.

Room 307 has a side view of the Eiffel thats gorgeous, but if you are a couple who needs touch of romance, as for a room with a full view. The bathrooms are very clean. The cleaning staff is very diligent. Staff in general is pretty good. I really liked Emilie and Firuz. Very polite and helpful. The older gentleman is a tad headstrong. I asked him to book me a private transfer to Versailles. He insisted Taxi was cheaper and would do just fine. I didnt care for cheap. I wanted to go to Versailles. Sure enough next day the Taxi did not show up due to strikes. Such a bummer. Other than that it was a good stay.

Cons: I wish they offered a better breakfast spread for the basic 9 euro deal. 19 euros gets you omlettes etc but thats too expensive especially when bakeries abound outside.",December 2019,Hotel La Comtesse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d10159593-Reviews-Hotel_La_Comtesse-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Too big, dark, dank, and just doesnt stand up to the hype","I was completely unimpressed by the Louvre. Its too big for its own good. The whole place feels dark and dank. Its hard to find exhibits even with a map.

The Monalisa is vastly underwhelming. After seeing her, I am not sure she was even painted by Leonardo. May be he sketched her and one of his apprentices finished the commission. The painting was commissioned by a local trade to hang in his salon; it has neither the beauty nor the charm of a masterpiece. I dont get the hype. Dont waste your time lining up to see her. Wander about in the room and you will be able to catch a solid glimpse. . The most impressive part of the Louvre is its Egyptian collection. Now that is mind-blowing. Make time to see it for sure.

The starbucks on 1st floor is a great place to hang, relax, grab a coffee, recharge your phone... The museum shops have amazing souvenirs. Museum staff is in general friendly and helpful.",December 2019,Louvre Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188757-Reviews-Louvre_Museum-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,3.0,4.5
A delightful experience,"If there's one museum in Paris that I would not miss, it would be the Musee D'Orsay. It is conveniently located close to the Seine river walk. Easy to find. It use to an old train station that was built for the world fair. It had a grand hotel too. After the fair, it stood unused until the ministry of cultural affairs turned it in to a museum and thank god they did. What a splendid place this is... incredible. I know nothing of art or curating for a museum, but the power of a good curator can be felt even by untrained eyes like mine, especially on the 5th floor. Thats where I recommend you start your journey. The exhibition starts with joyful colors of Monet, Renoir, and Gaugain among others. Then you move to some revolutionary era art by Maximillian Luce. Its a bit dark. Then Monet brings you back to joy with vivid colors and happy festoons.

Walk down the floors to see greek and roman sculptures. Also check out any temp art shows they may be hosting. I saw Degas.

Pro tips: There is bathroom on the 6th floor. Its usually less used and clean because few people realize its there.",December 2019,Mus√©e d'Orsay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188150-Reviews-Musee_d_Orsay-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Food so excellent, you may want to hug the chef","An excellent Parisian restaurant with an authentic fill. Make a reservation. I died of food induced ecstasy when I took that first bite of wild boar pate. In Paris, meals are generally offered aa a package; a starter, entree, and dessert at Le Florimond costs 40 euros. Its not cheap but its also Paris. I found Le Florimond prices comparable to other places.

I went back 2 days in a row. First time I had Boar Pate for starter, Duck Confit for entree, and Creme Brulee. Next day I had Parsnip flan, salmon, and chocolate cream with Poached pear.

Perfectly located and reasonably priced,"I stayed at InnAthens from Dec 11-15. The hotel is centrally located and no more than 15 minutes from most major attractions including the Acropolis, Syntgama, Plaka, and Greek Forum. Its also close to some really good restaurants. Ask the staff for recommendations. They know the local places. The hotels breakfast spread is amazing. They make omelets etc on order but the buffet spread is great by itself. They make this amazing rice pudding. I could live off it.

That brings me to the people. Stellos and Elisabeth in the breakfast room are so sweet and helpful. They always served with a smile. The front desk staff is also caring and helpful. They made a point to give me least confusing directions and suggestions.

My room- a classic- was tad small, but this is Athens. I believe they have bigger rooms and suites too. The room was incredibly clean and comfy. The bathrooms are modern and spotless.

Truly a wonderful hotel. A gem.",December 2019,InnAthens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d8555475-Reviews-InnAthens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Spiros and his funny stories,"I am travelling solo. Safe transportation is key for a solo, female traveller. Georges taxi was perfect. They were very responsive. I always interacted with one person- Nicholas. It was nice to not be punted around between admin. I also had one driver all 4 days (that might not always be true). Spiros is an elderly gentleman. He is warm and welcoming like the greeks in general. He does love to talk, but he knows so much about Athens history, Greek history, and mythology.

Basic homemade greek cuisine with a side of excellent views,"The taverna is in Kastri. The village was relocated from Delphi in 1800s when excavations began. The taverna is a family run; Loukia is the manager, her husband Illias is the cook, and their two sons Theodore and Andreas help. The service was relaxed as Greece goes. The food is alright; basic. The grape leaves stuffed with rice were yummy. The fried kefalotori was greasy. The lamb in lemon sauce was fall off the bone but I couldnt tell the flavor of the sauce.

Good but not blown away,"May be its my fault for getting carried away with the hype. I had heard so much about this place (it was even in the NYT) that I expected to be blown away. I wasnt. It was average. Service was very good. The Shiraz I had with my lunch was amazing. The green salad with mastic cheese was highlight of the meal. The onion pie was ok. The octopus was a let down. It was cooked well and was fresh, but the sauce spoiled the taste..it was too overpowering

"Amazing, unassuming little restaurant with excellent food","My hotel manager recommended this place. It was so good, I am going there again tomorrow. They start you off on a complimentary shot glass of Tsipouro- an autumn liquor made from grapes and flavored with anise. I ordered Stamnagathi- A Cretean wild green. It was simply tossed in good olive oil. Very yummy. The main course was baby goat. It was fall off the bone and none of the strong flavor of goat. Well balanced with tender courgettes.

Beautiful hike through the wilderness,"This park is a hidden gem. Its an almost straight drive on 460 from WV, right across the border in to Virginia.

The rangers office is closed on Sunday, but you still have to pay $3 entry. Its cash only. There are envelopes available with tags for the dashboard. The entire trail- to and fro- is 4 miles. The lower trail is longer (2&3/4 of a mile) than the upper, but its more wild and beautiful. Highly recommend taking the lower trail to the falls. Good hiking shoes, plenty of water, energy bars or fruit, and insect repellant are highly recommended. Also best to carry a first aid kit. Would not recommend for people with disabilities, seniors, or with very young children.

A wonderful itinerary ruined by terrible guides,"We did three tours with Walks of Italy; Colosseum Underground and Forum with Stephanie on 3/22, Vatican Pre-opening with Tungi on 3/23, and Catacombs with Yamira on 3/24. I did the Colosseum and Vatican tour with The Roman Guy last year. In comparison to TRG, I found the Walks Of Italy tours poorly managed and executed. This was primarily due to the agenda of each tour and the guides. The only exception was the tour of the Catacombs with Yamira. She was excellent. Not only did she know the subject, but she was very considerate, providing adequate restroom breaks and time to buy souvenirs. I felt like she gave adequate attention to everyone in the group. Even though it was a large group, no one was left out.

Cons:
General:
-Each tour started at least 5-10 minutes walking distance away from the attraction. When you have groups with young kids, please try to meet at places closer to the point of interest, especially since each tour is at least 3 hours of walking.

Tour Specific:

Colosseum Tour: The tour started by the Colosseum, but we were told we would be walking to the other end of the forum first because our appointment at the Colosseum was not until later. Fine, I understand that schedules are controlled by the state. But then, why start the tour by the the Colosseum. Why not start it by the Forum? Our tour guide was Stephanie. She is an American expat. She seemed knowledgeable but, there is a huge difference in knowing and in loving what you do. During the 10 minute walk from Colosseum to Forum, she ranted on about the corruption in Italy. She pointed to the balcony from which Mussolini would give his speeches and used the words, ""He would go blah blah blah from that balcony"". She used the same words describing the Orators at the forum. A bit more enthusiasm and love for the rich history would have improved the experience. I understand she was catering to an American audience but not all of us aspire to be the ""ugly American"".

Vatican- This tour had the strangest agenda ever. Our guide was Tungi. We walked through the hall of tapestries without explanation because ""the sistine would be crowded""- which it already was- and then we walked back through it, when the crowds made it impossible to observe the tapestries. He gave us ZERO breaks in a 3.5 hour tour. The young kids in the group were frustrated. He gave no breaks for souvenirs. This is the Vatican. We have friends who are suffering from cancer and had requested rosaries. We couldnt stop because Tungi had places to be. When I did the same tour with TRG, the guide asked everyone if they had special interests. I mentioned the statue of Augustus from Prima Porta. The guide took that in to account. When I told Tungi, he told me he had no idea what I was talking about. The guy has been doing the tour for 7 years and doesnt know about the most famous statue of the most famous Roman Emperor. Frustrating after spending all that money.

Catacombs: I enjoyed this tour and I enjoyed it because of Yamira.",March 2019,Walks of Italy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d1838073-Reviews-Walks_of_Italy-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,3.0,5.0

"Great place, poor customer service","This is not a zoo. Its an attempt at conservation. My 9 year olds loved this place. The informational walk through was helpful, but the interactive one on one part takes the cake.

It would've been a perfect experience, if not for our guide ""Gabe"". He was knowledgeable, but very uptight. He was constantly shutting down comments. I understand the clock was ticking but he made it obvious that he was rushing us. Its also not a good move to be condescending towards people whose reservations fund your facility. We are not all ""scientists"". Then he went on to call some Otters ""A$$holes"" in front of my 9 year olds. NICE.. NOT!!!

UPDATE: Forgot to add earlier. Gabe called Jaguars/ Panthers (Layla and her BF), ""Pitbulls of the wild"" for their viciousness. As a dog rescuer who has to fight against breed discrimination, that really grated on my nerves. May be educate him to the fact that pitbulls are just as dangerous as their owners make them to be..

Friendly service worth the money,"My husband and I spent 3 glorious days at this property. Two weeks before arrival I emailed them that we were there to celebrate our anniversary. I also asked for restaurant recommendations. I immediately received recommendations of several types of restaurants from Sushi to French. We visited 2 of the restaurants they suggested, both turned out to be good. On arrival, we found the hotel teeming with a large corporate group. We couldnt get the upgrade we had requested, however they offered us complimentary late checkout. They also sent complimentary chocolate strawberries to the room. They did everything they could to make us feel welcome. Speaking of, the entire staff is extremely polite; from valet to front desk to the concierge and even the engineering staff. The valet staff will offer cold bottles of water as you step in and out. Thats a nice touch when its 102 degrees outside. Lucia- their engineering manager (?) arranged for us to get cappucino by the pool at 5:00AM, because we wanted to watch the sunrise. They will literally bend over backwards to accommodate (reasonable) request. They had a lovely spread of candy at the concierge desk everday. I had been sending pics to my kids, teasing them.

Eden Roc is simply the BEST. I will never stay anywhere else in Positano. The staff is so responsive to emails, calls, questions. The rooms are amazing. They are clean and well stocked. The hotel is located fairly close to the beach and main shopping area.

Toni in the breakfast area is a gem. He is truly sweet. Quite a chatacter. Their breakfast spread is great as is but Toni will fix your omlets and warm up the quiche if you ask. Little things like that.

Poor service and bland ambience,"This is not a 4star. Sure, they say they are but the service is anything but. Lets start with pre-booking interactions. Our booking was March 21-25. I sent them an email on March 1st asking for help with getting reservations at a coveted restaurant. I didnt receive a response till March 21st- the day of arrival. Their front desk staff is very lethargic. In every hotel we went to on this trip, the front desk is always manned and they always wish incomong guests. At Kolbe they were usually in the space behind the wall behind the front desk. This lack of attentivity is my biggest complaint.

Then there is the ambiance. The building was an old monastery. They could have done so many cool things. Instead they have put up these cheesy looking Roman headless mannequins. The rooms are very spartan. They have the space to make this place more welcoming.

"Greasy, bland food.","This is a small family owned joint. For that reason, I really wanted to like it. The ambiance and service are both bad. We sat for 15 minutes before we were served water and that too after asking for it. The food came relatively quickly but it wasnt all that good. The chutneys were flavorless. The dosas and medu vada were greasy. The medu vada was raw on the inside. The food was so greasy that hours later I can smell the oil on me.

Terrible Management... Great experience.,"If I were rating for the experience only, this review would get 5 stars. The management brings the rating down. The lines for the attraction are so long, they need to come up with more efficient management. They came up with discovery pass. Awesome, can we breeze through? Ummm NO. Get back in line and pick up an actual timed ticket and then get in to another queue to be let in. The pros are the staff, most of whom are polite.

What a let down,"A place that charges $42 for an entree can be considered high end. A high end place must meet certain level of service, presentation and flavor. Red Coach Inn failed on all 3 accounts.

They tried to seat us inside. Did not offer the option to be seated on the patio. The inside was dank and stuffy. We had to ask to be seated outside on the patio.

Server came and said hello. Then a second server came along. Two servers and yet water came 15 minutes later and bread didnt come for 20 minutes and only after we asked for it. They took our appetizers to other tables. They didnt know which table to match the order to. The food was alright. Chicken in Piccatta was dry. The seafood trio was loaded with side of rice. Crab cakes had no flavor.

It took another 15 minutes for the check after asking for it. The only upside was the waitress ""Jessica"" was polite (but not engaging).

If this was Applebees, expectations would be low and I would give at least 3 stars.

Highlight of Palm Springs trip,"Very impressed with the management of this park. They have visitors centers at every entrance, which are staffed with the most helpful folks. The younger guy helping us was so knowledgeable. They sell hats and water. STOCK UP. If you are there in Summer like us, pack as much water as you can..

The entrance fee seems steep ($30 per car) but its well worth it. The park is extremely well maintained. They have well marked trails. The vista points along the road are great. Everything has been planned with attention to detail. Restrooms at each stop. I just wish they had vending machines or stalls selling cold water.

They were closing, but when my driver told them I was visiting from the US and how badly I wanted to taste Roman cuisine, they very graciously agreed to stay open a bit longer. They did not rush me through the courses at all. Each course was carefully laid our and explained by very polite staff. The food was also excellent. Highly recommended.

Top of the line hotel in beautiful Positano,"Eden Roc is perched on the side of the cliff. Easy access to the beach and the city square. I stayed in the junior suite #326. The views were INCREDIBLE.

Everywhere in Itasly, I found the room temps hotter than I like. But they will turn it down for you if you call them.

Excellent service and customer care,"As a woman travelling solo, I needed a company I could rely on. I was exchanging emails with Josephine. She set my mind at ease right away. She was extremely responsive and I almost felt like I had a friend I could rely on.

I was in Positano for 3 days. The first driver they assigned, didnt work out for me. He was a nice guy but very talkative. I texted Josephine that night and she arranged for someone else to drive me next day. That person was Rino. I cannot say enough good things about Rino.

He was another friendly face in a new area. He understood my interest in archaeology and took me to digs most people dont know about. Most importantly, he ensured my safety. In Napoli I wanted to buy Sflogliatelle. He walked half mile with me to ensure I was safe.

They give you great recommendations for things to do, places to go, where to eat.... go with their recommendations. The entire staff seems to be from the Sorrento- Naples area. They know what they are talking about.

Giving 4 stars for location. Its at least 10-15 minute walk to Trevi, Pantheon and Spanish steps and longer to Colisseum, Forum, Palatine hill, Trastevere... etc. Although they will get you a taxi with 3-4 minutes.

I also loved the manet phone they offered. Mind you, if you adjust voltage in room to US settings, you will need to use your charger to charge the manet.

Wonder at the marvel that was Roman architecture,"I took an underground Colosseum tour with The Roman Guy.. totally worth it.

3 tours and all winners,"Let me start with The Roman Guys booking support. Its amazing. They are super supportive and the whole operation is just seamless. They are pricey but no more than the other quality tours, plus you get what you pay for.

I did 3 tours with them;
1. Early entrance vatican- small group
2. Tivoli- private
3. Colosseum underground, palatine and forum - small group

My guide for first 2 was Franco. Franco has amazing knowledge of ancient and medieval Italian history. He tells great stories and makes the tour fun and relatable. When I told him of my interest in Caesar Augustus, he made sure to include Augustus of Prima Porta in the vatican museum visit portion of the tour. He was truly in his element at Villa Adriana in Tivoli. He is an admirer of Hadrian and may have encouraged me to take up reading about Hadrian.

My guide at Colisseum was Marie Lisa.. shes young but no less knowledgeable and very very kind. What a lovely young lady! She made the long walking tour fun. Again after hearing my interest in Augustine history, she pointed out the places connected to Augustus for me.

Both guides did not sugarcoat Italian history. They told us frankly when facts were unclear and also spoke at length about the plunder of roman ruins by Sixtus and other popes.

Speaking of pope, the highlight of my visiting was seeing Pope Francis from 2 feet away.",March 2018,The Roman Guy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d3167242-Reviews-The_Roman_Guy-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Presumptuous customer service IS poor customer service,"This review is based entirely on customer service OR lack thereof.

I had a new direct report join yesterday 8/1. Both of us are in business attire. During lunch we are sitting across from each other, talking business. After lunch, the server brings the check... One check. He NEVER asked us if we wanted one check. He then proceeds to hand the check to my direct report- a guy. Of course!! I quickly reach for the check. My direct report protests and asks to split. I overrule and pay anyway. The server then proceeds to make a joke about how, ""She.'s made up her mind""... Yes, the little lady has made up her mind. Sexism and patriarchy at its worst.

Usually, I choose to ignore BS. But this offended me on so many levels;

1. First, two Indian Americans walk in and despite the business attire and business chatter at the table, you assume they are a couple. You bring one check without us asking for it. This has happened to me before with people pointing to random brown kids and telling me how beautiful they are (Um, thank you but they arent mine).

2. Second, you immediately assume that the man will pay the bill, in this day and age. Leave the patriarchy at home.

3. Third, even after my employee tells you that I am his boss, you treat it as a joke. As if, I couldnt possibly be his boss.

Worst thing was, this server had a new guy shadowing him.",August 2017,P.F. Chang's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g50065-d462306-Reviews-P_F_Chang_s-Beachwood_Ohio.html,"Beachwood, Ohio",restaurants,2.0,3.5

Nothing impressive; you get what you pay for,"The overall experience wasnt bad. The booking was easy. Derrick was very helpful at booking our trip. Rescheduling was easy, when rain spoiled our plans on Day 1. We were booked on the Ultimate Adventure. We didnt feel rushed. Most of the crew was polite. I thought Dan- the parasail boat captain -was a bit over the top, but we only had to put up with him for a short time.

Cons:

1. The food is terrible. We paid 500+ for 4 (2 kids and 2 adults). I guess you get what you paid for.

2. The constant reminders about tipping are extremely annoying. Cmon, we are adults. We know to tip. Those who dont want to, will not tip anyway.

3. The crowd. It was busy. They break you in to groups but I like my space. Honestly, I would happily pay twice the price and book a private tour next time, where we are not packed like sardines.

4. A little help for beginners? It was my first time for parasail, jet ski and snorkel. Except jet ski, I felt like I was left to fend for myself for everything else. The ocean currents were very strong. I could not enjoy snorkel at all. Didnt see anything.
