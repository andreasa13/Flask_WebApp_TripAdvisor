Hot and amazing,"Beautiful and stunning. I will not tell you its a must see, because it is obvious.

Breakfast was super good, a lot of fresh and healthy food to choose from! Dried fruits and etc!+ a tea/coffee station on the ground floor.

stroll,"If you like and can walk a lot-you would definitely love Kolomenskoe , and even if you can't you can just ride it. It's beautiful! The view of the Moscow river is stunning, the churches are very cheap to visit (100RUR) and the house of Peter the Great is more expensive. The gardens of apples are stunning, more than 900 trees-amazing. Very good for any walk, or rest with children, or alone.",June 2015,Kolomenskoye Historical and Architectural Museum and Reserve,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298484-d300345-Reviews-Kolomenskoye_Historical_and_Architectural_Museum_and_Reserve-Moscow_Central_Russia.html,"Moscow, Russia",attractions,4.0,4.5
Wow,"If there is a Russian Versailles -then it is it! I liked Versailles, by the way. But the Archangelskoe is amazing, I don't know, if it is the land or views or the atmosphere or what, but you really want to see and experience all these beauties, for a stroll or for a nice photo shoot. The ticket prices are high, but really worth to see it, the couples like to rent the place (main building) to register their weddings, despite the fact that it needs to be re-innovated-really nice.",June 2015,Arkhangelskoye Estate and Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2540872-d568284-Reviews-Arkhangelskoye_Estate_and_Museum-Arkhangelskoye_Krasnogorsky_District_Moscow_Obla.html,"Arkhangelskoye, Russia",attractions,5.0,4.0

Kremlin,"It's very beautiful and amazing, especially if you visit in summer time, when it's all green. You better get a guide (if you have time try to find by yourself in social networks) because there are 5 churches + Ivan the Great Bell Tower and Royal Bell and much more, because the history lesson there never ends. Of course Yspenskiy Sobor (Tum of Russian priests) is the best of all as well as Arkhangelsky (Tum of Russian Kneazi).",April 2015,Moscow Kremlin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298484-d300392-Reviews-Moscow_Kremlin-Moscow_Central_Russia.html,"Moscow, Russia",attractions,5.0,4.5
