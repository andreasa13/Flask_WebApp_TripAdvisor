Not the best Nando's,"Whilst in terms of food, this branch was on par with others, the service and the layout of the place lets it down. Staff were not attentive and the seating felt cramped.",December 2019,Nando's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d3547459-Reviews-Nando_s-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Beautiful views and great food,"Loved this place- wonderful service, great views of the area and amazing food. The tacos and the bread with the roasted red peppers were great. Just make sure you book in advance as it is choc a block with bookings.",December 2019,Decimo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d19260272-Reviews-Decimo-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
A genuine Italian!,This was a cozy little Italian place off Baker Street with singing waiters. The food was reasonably priced but pretty average. The bread etc to start with was a nice touch. The best bit was when we asked to see the dessert menu and they literally took out all their dessert dishes and displayed them on the table.,November 2019,Anacapri,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1043836-Reviews-Anacapri-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
There's better coffee places in Covent Garden,"This place has awful service. Walked in, nobody there to greet us at the door. Both the person behind the counter and the waitress were totally not friendly and should not be doing the jobs they have. The cake was good but the milkshake was so watery. Would not go here again.",November 2019,Double Shot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1847924-Reviews-Double_Shot-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Used a Time Out voucher for brunch,"Came here for the brunch and was initially very put off by the young waiter who served us. He came to offer us prosecco- i said I didn't drink and could I have a non alcoholic alternative and he looked like I had asked him something obscene and said he couldn't do that. I have been to many brunches and never refused a non alcoholic alternative. After he eventually checked with his boss, he gave me orange juice. Then it took them forever to even take our orders for main course. It was all in all very average.",November 2019,Urban Meadow Cafe and Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d5439558-Reviews-Urban_Meadow_Cafe_and_Bar-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
A nice addition to the neighbourhood,Came here for lunch the week after it opened and though the dishes were amazing - I did think the pastas were very much on the small side and not enough value for money. The desserts however were fantastic- both the lemon tart and the chocolate cake were great.,November 2019,Lina Stores King's Cross Restaurant & Deli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d19438221-Reviews-Lina_Stores_King_s_Cross_Restaurant_Deli-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
It's OK,Came here for the first time last week and it was OK. Food was OK and served in a decent amount of time. I do however prefer Mecca as it is a much nicer experience.,November 2019,Buzz Bingo Enfield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g580413-d10075195-Reviews-Buzz_Bingo_Enfield-Enfield_Greater_London_England.html,"Enfield, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,2.5
Speedy service,"Came here for a quick dinner on a Friday night and got a table straight away. You have to order at the counter before receiving your meal which is brought to your table. They had a great Â£10 deal for a burger, fries and drink which was worth the money.",November 2019,Gourmet Burger Kitchen (GBK),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2256980-Reviews-Gourmet_Burger_Kitchen_GBK-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great respite from Greek cuisine,"After spending four days in Greece, you can have your fill of gyros and souvlaki so on our last night we decided to try this Indian place as we had heard so much about it. We were disappointed - the manager was very friendly. The only reason I haven't given it five stars is because we asked for the food to be 'mild-medium spice' but the bhindi was really spicy, to the extent that I couldn't finish it. However, the rest of the experience was 5-star!",October 2019,Indian Haveli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d9979781-Reviews-Indian_Haveli-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,5.0
A great place to watch football,"We initially came here because we found good reviews of its food. The margherita pizza was really good but the Spaghetti Pomodoro was disappointing and rather than tasting Italian, it had the flavourings of other cuisines. It was a nice place though and they were showing the international football match so we stayed longer because of that.",October 2019,Masters Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12696213-Reviews-Masters_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Rooftop drinks,Came here for drinks after dinner and the view was not quite what I expected- you can't really see the Parthenon from the rooftop. The drinks however were really good value and very generous in portion size.,October 2019,Thea Terrace Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3709146-Reviews-Thea_Terrace_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Quick stop,You don't need to much time to explore this location but if you have bought the combo ticket from the Acropolis- it is worth paying a visit here.,October 2019,Roman Agora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242841-Reviews-Roman_Agora-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
It's ok,"I would only recommend this place if you have bought the combo ticket from the Acropolis but, I do not think it merits a visit otherwise. There isn't too much there.",October 2019,Hadrian's Library,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d6739897-Reviews-Hadrian_s_Library-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,3.5
Lots to see!,We got the combo ticket from the Acropolis and so ventured here. There is a substantial collection of ruins here and my favourite bit is the corridor where they have lots of statues- many of which are headless.,October 2019,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Gorgeous greenery,"Came here for a morning walk and it was lovely. There is ample green space, seating, a playground for kids, an imposing fountain.

Cheap lunch spot,"We came here for lunch during our trip to Athens and it looks a bit dingy and not very luxurious but the waitress was very friendly. We ordered the souvlaki and it was OK- not the worst but, not the best either. The waitress was very sweet and gave us complimentary ice cream.",October 2019,Victory Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12706875-Reviews-Victory_Cafe-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,5.0
Historic site,"We bought the multi-site entrance ticket from the Acropolis and so, came here and it was very nice to see.

A salute to the traditional Olympic Games,It is a part of history and a very impressive stadium. There is a 5 euro fee to enter which we did not do but instead took photos from the entrance. The inside though has a very cool area where you can stand on winners' podiums.,October 2019,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Worst meal we had in Athens,I did not rate this place at all! It was the most disappointing meal we had in the city. The service was basically non-existent and I would not recommend dining here.,October 2019,Ydria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d739498-Reviews-Ydria-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Best place for breakfast in Plaka!,"After we were disappointed with our hotel breakfast on our first morning in Athens, we found this place and ate at it every day. My husband loved the poached eggs in a roll and I really liked the fruit salad and the fresh chocolate chip bread. The only thing I did not like was there toast- it was very crispy and broke in half like a biscuit. The waiter was really lovely though.",October 2019,Pantheon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14183897-Reviews-Pantheon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,5.0
