Outstanding Adventure Organisation by Advantour,"We are older travellers who were very keen to travel in Uzbeckistan, we communicated several times with Gulsanam from Advantours and the plan she suggested was very comprehensive and intriguing.
It included 9 days with 8 nights accommodation, one high speed train trip, one plane flight back to Tashkent and a personal driver for all other travel.
Although the hotels were stated to be economy, they were in fact comfortable and suitable in every way.
Most importantly the two drivers assigned to us were professional, friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us.
We had four different guides in Tashkent, Samakand, Bukhara and Khiva all of whom were well informed , excellent communicators and shared the amazing knowledge with us freely.

The paths and boardwalks are very narrow and people taking selfies cause difficulties as it is difficult to pass.
do not try and take pushchair, ride on toys and wheelchairs, the paths and hundreds of steps are not suitable.
take plenty of water, there is good available in different parts
It was a great day. There are boats and trains to move you to starting points.

FANTASTIC Location near old town.,"The location is in a quiet lane 2 minutes from the old city, market, supermarket and bakery was excellent. 10 minutes from bus station and ferry dock.
Elena and her husband met us at the ferry even though it was 10pm to direct us to the room.
Be very careful when booking rooms and apartments as we thought we had an apartment but had inadvertently booked a very small room. We did however have use of a large courtyard with shade and outdoor furniture.
No breakfast but we prepared our own and ate outside.
The bed comfortable and very clean, average pillows.
Limited crockery and electric jug supplied.
Elena very friendly and helpful.
She could not assist with changing our room as she was fully booked.",May 2017,Elena Rooms,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295370-d3256687-Reviews-Elena_Rooms-Split_Split_Dalmatia_County_Dalmatia.html,"Split, Croatia",hotels,3.0,4.5

Outstanding because so different,"A series of organ pipes Set in the water with holes in the pathway to let the music out. When boats go by the sounds change, lovely seeing the children lying on the path with their ears on the holes.
Lots of people swimming off the steps.
Worth a visit. Just sit and take in the sites.",June 2017,Sea Organ (Morske Orgulje),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295374-d2294071-Reviews-Sea_Organ_Morske_Orgulje-Zadar_Zadar_County_Dalmatia.html,"Zadar, Croatia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Barely worth two,"I had good old spargetti bologanise, miserable helping 1 teaspoon meat sauce.
My husband has a questionable rice risotto, sticky and tastless, we felt really ripped off. The glass of wine a silly price.
Never again.",May 2017,Doris,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1007309-d8374181-Reviews-Doris-Korcula_Town_Korcula_Island_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Korcula Island, Croatia",restaurants,2.0,3.0
Cramped but perfectly positioned,"The location was perfect in the old city near the North gate. We rang before for instructions to get there, with out which it could have been difficult.
Our room differed significantly from that advertised, it was very cramped,we could not pass each other unless one sat on the lumpy bed, clean, excellent new bathroom.
The single sheet on the double bed was clean but other bedding grubby.the staff generally were very helpful but the owner somewhat morose.
We liked the atmosphere in the old city.",June 2017,Apartments Dukic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295381-d3721982-Reviews-Apartments_Dukic-Kotor_Kotor_Municipality.html,"Kotor, Montenegro",hotels,3.0,3.5
Perfect value for money,"The staff were fantastic and helpful. I had a sore throat on arrival and was made a hot lemon and honey drink.
The apartment was spacious, sunny with a lovely balcony.
Spotless, well equipped kitchen and furniture.
Yes it was a walk back from town, so take a bus or taxi. The walk down was less than 10 minutes to the old city.
Walk to chairlift 15 minutes and 2 minutes to self catering grocery store and pizza Hut.
Great views",June 2017,Villa Dard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295371-d2020425-Reviews-Villa_Dard-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",hotels,5.0,4.0
Awesome meal reasonable price,"We followed Trip Advisor reviewers excellent advice and found out where Tanja was. Go out the Main gate of the old city, turn left and walk to roundabout, cross road Tanja opposite the supermarket.
Yes, it is a huge well cooked BBQ, it is pork, chicken, sausages, chips and a mountain of salad enough for two.
Price was 17 euro with 2 small bottles of very good red wine.
A good recommendation, a bit rough and ready, out in the garden was nice.",June 2017,Tanjga,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295381-d6848872-Reviews-Tanjga-Kotor_Kotor_Municipality.html,"Kotor, Montenegro",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Cosy and Comfortable,"We had difficulty when we booked hotel Komador, we booked via Trip advisor who had an agent and they would not allow us to change our booking.
We were really pleased when we arrived the staff changed our booking as requested for no cost.
The rooms were comfortable, well appointed but lacked a jug to make tea and coffee. When booking make sure you request a balcony room.
There was a good lift, excellent pool, excellent breakfast and close to the number 4 city bus.
Good swimming virtually over the road, but do not expect a Sandy beach,
The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.
The buffet evening meal was good value.",June 2017,Hotel Komodor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295371-d313151-Reviews-Hotel_Komodor-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",hotels,4.0,3.5
