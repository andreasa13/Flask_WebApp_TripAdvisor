Impressive views but too hot,Impressive views of Athens can be seen here. The pantheon was impressive but it was too hot. There is no shelter built and lots of stairs to climb. Do be careful as some of the rocks and marble slabs are very slippery. No food and drinks allow except water.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
