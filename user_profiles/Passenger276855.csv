This is a great place for food and service,This is a great place for food. I’d been meaning to go in for some time for a breakfast and it was SO worthwhile. I had the Lane regular breakfast and it was spot on in terms of quality and quantity. Service is friendly and unobtrusive. Will definitely be going back to try an evening meal.,February 2020,203 The Lane,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g528793-d15266339-Reviews-203_The_Lane-Stockport_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Stockport, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"We had pasta and it was very, very tasty.","3 generations visited Dough and even though it is a pizza restaurant we all decided to have pasta. Each meal was delicious and even though the plates seemed not full when we got them there was easily enough. Their plates are deep! We had garlic bread with tomato as a starter and it was thin and delicious. The pasta meals were carbonara, rage and prawn based dishes. All very, very tasty. A good selection of wines is on offer and a delightful IPA. Will definitely go there again ... for a pizza this time!",December 2019,Dough Pizza Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d1307696-Reviews-Dough_Pizza_Kitchen-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Souvenir hunting,This is an outstanding place to visit for its history and high quality souvenirs. On Deansgate it is easily identified by the appearance ... it stands out from everything else! The cafe was only adequate.

An interesting concept for food,"This restaurant uses the old silk road as its inspiration for food from a large number of places. It didn't quite work. The food was ok but not great and the temperature of the food was variable. There is a good atmosphere in there with good service mainly, and it is a lively place to go with friends, for a meal and a drink especially if there is a deal on. I will definitely go again and try another dish or two.",July 2019,Silk Rd Bramhall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1809219-d15523114-Reviews-Silk_Rd_Bramhall-Bramhall_Stockport_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Bramhall, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Coffee and a biscuit after the school rurun,"A home made biscuit and an Americano coffee to take the chill off after school was just what I wanted. The festively decorated cafe had lots of well behaved children with their parents. A.mixture of seats and sofas makes for a relaxed atmosphere There are books and games to entertain the children and the food was good, the coffee and complimentary biscuit pleasant. Will definitely call in again.",December 2019,The Little Hideout Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1809219-d14772020-Reviews-The_Little_Hideout_Cafe-Bramhall_Stockport_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Bramhall, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Out of this world,"A half day trip to Jodrell Bank was a first time visit and about 25.minutes drive from Bramhall. Parking was easy (£4), the cafe bad good hot food and the shop had a plethora of excellent astrononly and science style gifts. The self-guided trip is a bit dispersed around me the site but which gives you ample opportunity to see everything on offer. The main telescope and its history is stunning, as was the 20 minute talk about it. A great place to visit in the wide open spaces of Cheshire.",November 2019,Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g191278-d213881-Reviews-Jodrell_Bank_Discovery_Centre-Macclesfield_Cheshire_England.html,"Macclesfield, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.0
The authentic taste of India,The food and service is excellent at this local restaurant.

Amazing Athens,"The meat market is simply stunning
It is riot of colour, noise and fresh food of all sorts. The fish market is in the inner area and is equally amazing. Outside the main hall is the sumptuous vegetable market. And hidden at the end farthest away from the main hall is a secret underground taverna where the food and drink is just served to you. No choice and it was delicious.",September 2019,Central Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d566808-Reviews-Central_Market-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Best pasta in Manchester,We wanted a good Italian meal and went on spec here as they make their own pasta fresh every day. The interior was cafe-like and very welcoming. We noticed that every dish collected from our neighbours was cleared!
