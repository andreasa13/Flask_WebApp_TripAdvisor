The well appointed rooms are complemented by the pool and mineral baths, making it an attractive venue.

It is extremely disappointing that breakfast is not included in the room rate which is high, especially when a large group had booked. That is a question the management should seriously
consider as most of us were of the same impression.",August 2018,Oak Bay Beach Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g154945-d1162014-Reviews-Oak_Bay_Beach_Hotel-Victoria_Victoria_Capital_Regional_District_Vancouver_Island_Briti.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",hotels,4.0,4.5
Fulsome Brunch,"Someone had suggested that this would be a good idea for a Sunday brunch and they were correct. There were no tables available so like others we had to wait, but it was worth it.

An English full breakfast and a hash breakfast were chosen, l believe that the full English was the better choice but both were fine choices.

Make a date for the Brunch...",August 2018,The Village Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154945-d2302132-Reviews-The_Village_Restaurant-Victoria_Victoria_Capital_Regional_District_Vancouver_Isla.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.5

You must do a visit with them",August 2018,AIBC Architectural Walking Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154943-d2085204-Reviews-AIBC_Architectural_Walking_Tours-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver, Canada",attractions,5.0,5.0
Unexpectedly good museum,"Somehow you do not associate a ski resort with a good museum. This interesting design holds a gem of a museum dedicated to the First Nations.

The guides transmit their passion for their heritage. The exhibits - canoes, blankets, basketwork are all well displayed
Even the local Bannock bread can be tried in the cafe, which was good value.

At the museum you cannot buy the discounted two museum ticket for Audain and Squamish at the museums, only at the Tourist Office.",August 2018,Squamish Lil'wat Cultural Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154948-d1009660-Reviews-Squamish_Lil_wat_Cultural_Centre-Whistler_British_Columbia.html,"Whistler, Canada",attractions,5.0,4.5
After a long flight,"We asked a friend for a good local place to eat and she suggested here.
It was a sunny evening eating outside.

Off the tourist track,"Local friends said we'll meet you there. A range of Indian & Middle Eastern selection of dishes, all interesting.

Two of us had the Tasting menu which was copius and satisfying, some choose a lesser number of dishes.

Amazingly good vegetarian restaurant,"Located away from the centre, it is used by the locals and you have to await your table.

It is well worth it, the starters and mains were delicious and we even tried desserts with extra spoons.

We were suitably impressed and enjoyed the locality.",August 2018,The Acorn Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154943-d3538423-Reviews-The_Acorn_Restaurant-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver, Canada",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Well known - justifiedly,"Wishing to try some of Vancouver's Chinese heritage we decided upon Dynasty. It is so popular you have to wait in line.
Once seated it was worth waiting for.
The Crab claw starters were fine, the Scallop & Prawn, Chicken and Dynasty fried rice were fine. Generous portions were the norm.",August 2018,Dynasty Seafood Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154943-d1890632-Reviews-Dynasty_Seafood_Restaurant-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
