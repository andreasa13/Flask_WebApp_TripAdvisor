Full of beautiful Delphi artefacts,Entrance is included with the Delphi ticket. A museum full of artefacts that have been unearthed from the Delphi site. Lots of information as you walk around and sometimes lots of tour groups that just take over but you can get away from them if you want. Staff were very friendly and very helpful. Look at the way the statues and pediments were created - the workmanship is unbelievable considering how long ago they were created.,September 2019,Delphi Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d199057-Reviews-Delphi_Archaeological_Museum-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Temples and Scenery PLUS,"I did an organised tour which included Delphi - home of The Oracle - and our guide was excellent and very informative. The temples and the scenery are spectacular - and as she told us the history and stories that went with it, my imagination took off and Delphi came back to life. It is a bit of a hike up through the ruins but if you take your time it's fine. The Theatre is further up the hill and then the Stadium is further up lots of stairs. There is a museum before the entrance at the bottom and that has the famous Charioteer of Delphi. The museum is included in the ticket price. We did not hike down the hill to see the Temple of Athena - but after viewing it from afar I would suggest that if you are not on a tour take the time to visit.",September 2019,Delphi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d523823-Reviews-Delphi-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Incredible history,"Incredible, magnificent, unbelievable - what more can you say? Definitely a must see if you plan on visiting Athens but try and avoid the hot times of the day and most of the crowds. Early morning or late afternoon is best. It is a long climb up but totally doable - there are plenty of places to rest so take your time - venture off the path to get a birds eye view of the Odeon. Once you go up the stairs - be careful climbing over the tourist groups who just stop and sit on the steps - past the Monument of Agrippa and through the magnificent Propylaea, you are greeted by the magnificent Parthenon. You can see the restoration that has been happening as this is shown as the white marble. Wear shoes that can grip the ground and try not to walk on parts of the path that are marble as they are very slippery - find the sides of the path or the gaps with lots of pebbles. The toilet block is basic but adequate and the water from the dispenser outside is refreshing. The former museum has now been emptied and its treasures now reside in the New Acropolis Museum. The Caryatids on site are copies and most of the originals are in the New Museum which is at the bottom of the Acropolis before you enter and start the climb. Do some research before you go - this place just begs to be admired but respect it by not climbing over the ropes or smoking which a lot of tourists seem to do until the officials start blowing whistles. Also - please do not touch the marble columns - they are not magic and you will not get a thrill!",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
An incredible museum with Olympic artefacts,A wonderful museum situated in the Olympia complex that is well worth the visit. So many pieces that are familiar if you love history. Do some online research and you will enjoy every minute. Take your time and just wander around - some tour groups but they tend to head for the 'big name' items. There is a lot more to see if you look - -,September 2019,Archaeological Museum of Olympia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189487-d243257-Reviews-Archaeological_Museum_of_Olympia-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
History PLUS imagination,"An amazing site to walk around and imagine the Olympic Games in action. So many incredible places that are familiar through the media - do lots of research so that you can enjoy at your leisure - there are lots of information plaques around to help you out. The only down part were some tour groups who were on a tight schedule pushed and shoved and talked over the guides who were doing their best, but the place is so big you can get away from them. Every now and again sit under the trees and imagine being there in ancient times. The stadium is pretty sparse except for the starting blocks and the track and it always has those souls who want to run the length. Definitely a place for history - and then visit the on site museum.",September 2019,Archaeological Site of Olympia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189487-d243256-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Olympia-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A huge complex,There is more to Epidaurus than just the famous theatre. The Sanctuary of Asklepios - God of Medicine and Healing - is huge and is situated outside the Theatre. Read the signs and information placards that are situated at the major points of interest. There is a small museum full of artefacts that have been discovered around the sanctuary and is well worth a visit. Another place of wonderful history.,September 2019,Sanctuary of Asklepios,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g815573-d11917603-Reviews-Sanctuary_of_Asklepios-Epidavros_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Epidavros, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Take a seat - and listen,The Great Theatre is only one place of interest at the great site of Epidaurus. It looks bigger in photos and film but it did not seem to be that big in real life. Don't get me wrong it is still a big complex and maybe it was the intimacy of the place and the way the seating is arranged that made it seem smaller. The steps to the top are slippery and there are no handrails but if you are careful and take your time you should be OK - just go slow. Stand on the marker and test the acoustics - they are incredible. Tour groups and their leaders always give a rendition of something.,September 2019,The Great Theatre of Epidaurus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g815573-d198893-Reviews-The_Great_Theatre_of_Epidaurus-Epidavros_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Epidavros, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
A definite visit,Some would say there is nothing to see - it is just an empty structure but what to see is the incredible inside and the way it was built. The Treasury of Atreus or the Tomb of Agamemnon is a short walk from the main Mycenae complex. There are no artefacts inside - just a huge area but it is full of history when you realise it was built around 1250 BC. Be careful when you step inside - it is very dark so your eyes have to adjust.,September 2019,Citadel and Treasury of Atreus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189486-d243267-Reviews-Citadel_and_Treasury_of_Atreus-Mycenae_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Mycenae, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
History revealed,Mycenae - legendary kingdom of Agamemnon - is a place of unbelievable history. In reality what place in Greece is not? With Mycenae there is the Lions Gate and the grave circles where those golden treasures were discovered - most of which are now in the Archaeological Museum in Athens. Walk around the graves and imagine the gold that was buried within. With any ancient site there is a lot of rubble but there is a lot of information on the walkways so you will have to read up and use your imagination but it is definitely a place to visit. The pathway up to the palace is steep and not the best to walk on a hot day. There is a wonderful little museum full of interesting artefacts and well worth the visit. On another note the toilets are clean and well maintained.,September 2019,Archaeological Site Mycenae,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189486-d522565-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_Mycenae-Mycenae_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Mycenae, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very interesting,"A hot day to explore ancient Corinth - maybe not a good idea. Some research prior to visiting would not go astray and that will help you when you are looking at the ruins. The Temple of Apollo is impressive - as is Temple E, otherwise known as the Temple of Octavia. The complex covers a large area and is totally walkable but sometimes the ground is uneven so wear suitable shoes. If you are interested in St Paul, you can stand in front of the Rostra and Bema where he was tried, and thankfully found not guilty. Acrocorinth is situated on the high plateau - too much of a climb for me so I admired from afar.",September 2019,Ancient Corinth (Archaia Korinthos),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189484-d243253-Reviews-Ancient_Corinth_Archaia_Korinthos-Corinth_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Corinth, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing,"This canal that links the Corinth Gulf with the Saronic Gulf, is realistically, not a jaw dropping moment but to stand and look at what human effort can achieve is amazing to say the least. Walk across the footbridge and look at the narrow ribbon of blue water below and the sheer sides and you can get a sense of 'how on earth did they do that?' At one end there is a vehicle bridge that submerges under the canal water to let the boats through - unfortunately I did not get to see that.",September 2019,Corinth Canal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1188932-d2454053-Reviews-Corinth_Canal-Isthmia_Loutraki_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Isthmia, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
So Beautiful,"A little over an hour's drive along the coast you will catch a glimpse of the Temple of Poseidon standing proudly at Cape Sounion. It is an incredible place with views overlooking the Aegean and if it is a clear day, the blue of the ocean and the sky are great backdrops for this temple. Even though most of it lies in ruins, it can make your imagination run wild. There are a few stairs and ramps to climb but they are easy to manage - just take your time, stop and look around. Quite a few tourists when I went and the ever present whistle blowing officer telling people not to climb on the ruins. When will people be more respectful of history? You can walk all the way around the Temple - cannot see where Lord Byron scratched his name - but that's a minor thing. There is a souvenir shop and also a cafe that can be a godsend if you want to take refuge from the heat in Summer. I did one of the afternoon tours so could not stay for the sunset and that was disappointing.",September 2019,Temple of Poseidon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562628-d312283-Reviews-Temple_of_Poseidon-Sounio_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Sounio, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Incredible,"First - the entrance to the Temple is not near Hadrian's Arch. If you are walking from Syntagma then veer left down the street just before you get to the Arch. It is only a short distance on the right hand side of the street. Once in the Temple surrounds, you will be amazed at the sheet size and incredible workmanship (especially the
Corinthian columns) of what is left. Taking nearly 700 years to complete, the original temple had 104 columns, only 15 remain today, with one collapsed on the ground. There is only the temple columns to see but find a seat in the shade and imagine how splendid this once was. Public toilets are at the Hadrian's Arch end of the complex. Some restoration work when I was there but not enough to cover the columns.

Another Hadrian Triumph,"The Arch of Hadrian is an incredible gateway that reminds one of a Triumphal arch that you would see in Rome. It is on the main road through Athens and is about a 10 minute walk from Syntagma Square. It stands near the Temple of Olympian Zeus. Last time I was here it was covered for restoration so it was good to finally see it naked. It could do with a further clean but that's just my opinion, I would suggest you research the arch on line as there is no information boards around it.",September 2019,Arch of Hadrian (Pili tou Adrianou),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242820-Reviews-Arch_of_Hadrian_Pili_tou_Adrianou-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Incredible History,"If you are in Athens and you love history then this is the place to go. This is the most incredible museum of Greek and Greek related treasures. Everything from early Cycladic to the Classical Age to the Romans all in one building. Every historic site has a museum but to see items from everywhere in one place is a feast for the eyes. You may need two visits if you want to stand and wonder - The Mask of Agamemnon and the Gold of Mycenae; Poseidon or Zeus Artemesian Bronze, the Bronze Horse and Jockey; Classical statues and Grave Stele it's all here. It was a tad crowded when I visited but you can walk around and get away from the crowds to a certain degree. The only irritating point was the tour groups that seemed to spread over the entire room and who were so loud it was practically unbearable. Still that is only a minor irritation. What you see is well worth the effort.",September 2019,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very solemn and moving,Although the Changing of the Guard takes place every hour every day - the best time to go if you can is Sunday at 11am when they do a full ceremony with band and guard. Unfortunately there are loads of people and you may have to jostle for position or even get there 30 minutes or so before. It is a very solemn ceremony when the Evzone guard changes at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. I would thoroughly recommend this if you like the history and majesty of Greece.,September 2019,Changing of the Guard Ceremony,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12064411-Reviews-Changing_of_the_Guard_Ceremony-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Always worth it.,"Every time I travel on one of these HOHO buses I thoroughly enjoy myself seeing most everything a city has to offer. Athens was no different. The extra day was great and the young lass made a note of when I wanted to use the extra day as I would be traveling out of Athens for 2 days. The service by sellers and drivers was great and the route through Athens covered everything you need. A bit hot upstairs if there is no roof and hold onto your hat as you drive along. After doing the full loop you can plan where you want to stop and spend more time, it's the best way to beat the crowds and you get to see some great views. Best time of day is first thing in the morning - but the last at night is good although a bit crowded.",September 2019,City Sightseeing Athens & Beach Riviera Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11448070-City_Sightseeing_Athens_Beach_Riviera_Hop_On_Hop_Off_Bus_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,4.0
Great Iced Latte,On an unseasonably hot Athens Day - nothing better than an icy cold latte from this wonderful oasis. Situated near the Amalia Hotel - the service was great. Even though it is a small venue the friendliness of the staff and the powerful coffee smell was fabulous.

Great Hotel - Great Location,"I stayed here 4 times over my 4 week holiday in Greece and the Islands and was not disappointed in any of the rooms. As a single traveller, I had single rooms booked - 301 and 201 were small rooms tucked away in the corner of the hotel. The bathroom was tiny, tiny but as I was in the room only to shower and sleep they were OK. Room 217 was bigger and did not feel so claustrophobic - on my last stay I ended up with Room 403 which was a balcony room - loads of room with a great view over the National Gardens across the road. The traffic was no problem once the door was closed. The staff were very helpful, the breakfasts were great with loads of variety. This hotel is close walking distance to anything you want to see in Athens. Take the elevator to level 7 and enjoy the rooftop views - especially at night. I can thoroughly recommend the Amalia to anyone wanting a great, centrally located hotel. Great internet service and also complimentary yummy Turkish Delight and cool water in the foyer when you return from sightseeing",September 2019,Amalia Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d233049-Reviews-Amalia_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great food,"Made booking for 6,30pm and when we arrived the place was packed. We were seated inside but still had a view of Darling Harbour and the fireworks. Service was great - we started with Garlic Bruschetta which was deliciously hot when it arrived. Next the main - I had Veal Saltimbocca which was pan fried veal with sage, prosciutto and lemon butter sauce. Vegetables were sliced capsicum, green beans and sugar snap peas - everything was wonderful. The amount of veal was just too much, but they were glad to put it along with the remaining veggies in a take-away container. All the other meals looked great and were heartily devoured. For birthday celebrations of which there were many, they brought out a cake with sparklers and this was delivered to the birthday person by a group of guys banging a dirty big drum.

Hard pastry,Arriving around 7pm - we went and had some of Harry's famous pies. The filling of the Steak and Mushrooms was delicious BUT the pastry was so hard you could use the top as a frisbee. Maybe it was the lateness of the hour but it seems they had been in the warmers far too long and there was no moisture. If it wasn't for this and the fact that I paid $5.90 for some filling because I could not eat the pastry was a bit much.,January 2019,Harry's Cafe de Wheels - Penrith,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d10831579-Reviews-Harry_s_Cafe_de_Wheels_Penrith-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Not as good as hoped,Long queue out the front but seemed to move quickly. Finally got inside and then had to wait again for somewhere to sit. Ended upstairs - quite nice. Ordered what I thought was tuna sushi and some tempura but what arrived definitely was not tuna - and was gluey. The tempura however was delicious. Service was good. In hindsight - I would have preferred to stay in the nearby markets and have the street food.,November 2018,Sushizanmai Honjin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14129610-d3597151-Reviews-Sushizanmai_Honjin-Tsukiji_Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Tsukiji, Japan",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Great views,"On arriving it seemed to be a very touristy place . The lift to the 450 Floor was very quick and once arrived the viewing area was great - surprisingly not a lot of people in the late afternoon but the crowds sure grew as night fell. Taking photos and using a tripod was a challenge but most people were polite. There were others that were the typical rude tourists - pushing and shoving. We got there early on a very misty afternoon but as the lights came on throughout Tokyo the views got better. Our stay was about 2-3 hours but that is only because we were photographers on tour. You most probably do not need this much time - but pick what time of day you want to go.
This floor was decked out in all sorts of Christmas decorations and the plaza on ground level was the same. It turned into a magical Santaland for sure. Definitely enjoyed myself.",November 2018,Tokyo Skytree,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14134337-d1872416-Reviews-Tokyo_Skytree-Oshiage_Sumida_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Oshiage, Japan",attractions,4.0,4.0
Carnaby Street on steroids!,"I am talking about the Carnaby Street in London around 1965. Takeshita Street is a fascinating place if you love to people watch. Even though it was extremely crowded, people seemed to move freely - even people with dogs in prams! The clothes on display are something to behold - shops selling everything you could imagine. Animals made out of refreshing gelato means a visit to Eiswelt Gelato at the end of the street. This place is definitely a must - as are the shops that sell crepes filled with all sorts of treats. It is only a narrow street so there are not many places to sit and rest although I did find a bench in a side street where I could still see the main parade of characters. A great place to visit and experience the 'modern' Japan and it's youth.",November 2018,Takeshita Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1066456-d1373790-Reviews-Takeshita_Street-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Shibuya, Japan",attractions,5.0,4.0
Very calming,"This Buddhist temple – it’s history dates back to 1617 – is unlike any other, especially in terms of its architecture - it is very Indian/Asian in appearance. A wonderful welcome by a Buddhist Priest after we climb the stairs and we are advised if we want to go inside the Temple we need not remove our shoes. He gave us a lovely little booklet together with a paper keepsake and explained in hushed tones what was going on. He requests that we be quiet and then tells us we can take photos but please no flash. A very calming experience amidst the hustle and bustle of a big city.

Needs work to be more interesting,"Very disappointed with the lack of anything of interest at the Fish Market after the auctions are finished.. Apparently all the auctions occur around 5am and by the time we arrived around 8am it was all over. There is a large observation deck and you can look through the glass down to the selling area, It was rather like being in a sterile situation. The sushi restaurants were packed but we managed to find a little place out of the way that we could get a toasted sandwich and coffee. Vegetable Market was a bit better - still up and away from the action and looking through glass walls to what is happening below. Didn't seem to live up to expectations but hopefully things will improve as it is only new and still has to get some character.

Room was cosy and warm and the bathroom and toilet were very clean. Lots of extra bedding if you want a higher mattress. Our group only stayed for 1 night and the breakfast next morning was enjoyable and filling. The owner Mr Ichiro Yumoto, his wife and their staff made us feel very welcome.

Amazing light show,"This is one amazing place. Very dark when you first enter but as your eyes get accustomed you discover a world of light and movement that will leave you walking around with an amazed look on your face. No tripods are allowed so it's basically phones or hand held cameras with a high ISO. Features appear in one room - disappear and then appear somewhere else. Flowery animals wander around from place to place, and there are 'anchored' displays like the waterfall but it's wonderful to stand there and be covered by water, butterflies and flowers. The only down side was the Light and Sound show. While being incredible in itself it is in a small room and when there are loads of people it becomes very hot and cramped. With the lights and the music it gets a bit overpowering and if you can find a seat on the floor it's a bonus. Standing around the wall for around 15 minutes was a bit much. Maybe needs seating around the perimeter? This place is definitely a must if you are close by - bookings are essential and when we went the queue was an hour long but it kept moving so it wasn't too bad.

Great food and service,"We were here for our work Christmas Lunch and were not disappointed in our choice. Situated on Cockle Bay Wharf, we had excellent water views of Darling Harbour. Once seated the waiter came for our drinks order and then he brought water to the table. This was the only downside - on a hot day the last thing you want is room temperature water. Some ice in the serving jug would have been nice, but instead we had to ask for glasses of ice. We started with Mixed Breads and then Tasting Plates to Share (between two) - Grilled Prawns; Salt & Pepper Calamari; Buffalo Chicken Wings and Grilled Scallops. Once we were given time to digest and rest we then had the Main Course - Meat & Seafood Platter to Share (between two) - Grilled Sirloin Steak; Fillet Mignon; Garlic Prawns; Chicken Skewers; Half Pork Rack Ribs; Tempura Soft Shell Crab and Lamb Rack Cutlets. Mains were served with Onion Rings and Caesar salads The food was well cooked and delicious. I thought the bottled wine was overpriced as it is with all restaurants along the wharf. Cloudy Bay Sav Blanc at $73 per bottle when you can buy for around $30 at liquor stores - but I suppose you have to pay for the upkeep. Dessert Platter was excellent as was the service.

Wonderful viewing,The people that operate Raptor Domain have so much care and love for these birds that is not only shows on their faces but their winged friends as well. Very audience friendly especially for the youngsters it is a wonderful place to get up close to some of of the birds that you may never see in the wild. There is also a reptile showing at a different time when you can handle lizards and some snakes but not being a fan of these is why there are no photos. A great place for all the family - the staff are exceptional.,November 2017,Raptor Domain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g7179521-d1931139-Reviews-Raptor_Domain-Seal_Bay_Kangaroo_Island_South_Australia.html,"Kangaroo Island, Australia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Dolphins galore,"A wonderful day with dolphins, cormorants and pelicans. Andrew was so enthusiastic in his love for the area it carried over to the rest of our photography group.
When we found the dolphins Andrew created wake after wake so that the dolphins could have some fun surfing and leaping about creating many great photography opportunities. it was a fabulous day and our picnic lunch of fresh sandwiches and wraps was delicious. Heading back to the wharf we spotted cormorants and a young eagle. Truly, it was a difficult decision where we should aim our cameras as there was action all around. Thanks Andrew and Nina (hope I got the name right) it was an incredible experience. Only one complaint - the water was too cold for me to go swimming with the dolphins. Have to come back when it warms up.",November 2017,Kangaroo Island Marine Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g261647-d2486532-Reviews-Kangaroo_Island_Marine_Adventures-Kingscote_Kangaroo_Island_South_Australia.html,"Kangaroo Island, Australia",attractions,5.0,5.0
A great relaxing walk,The footbridge at Urunga is a great way to relax. Around 10 minutes walk to the beach but it is best to take your time - take a look around and appreciate the surroundings. There are stairs down to the lagoon in places and you can walk over to the mangroves at low tide.,September 2017,The Boardwalk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g529038-d4156569-Reviews-The_Boardwalk-Urunga_New_South_Wales.html,"Urunga, Australia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great place to stay,"Staying in the Satin Bower Bird cabin (#8) we found there was plenty of room for the 3 of us. A lovely verandah with table and chairs and inside there is an aircon unit. One room with a queen bed, one room with bunks, a kitchen/dining/with lounge that was ample size. TV has foxtel. The kitchen was well equipped and had a welcome pack with tea, coffee, sugar and milk in the fridge so that we could sit and relax before heading to the shops which are only a 5 minute walk. A good BBQ area for the cabins and free wi-fi to 100MB per day (but who comes here to check emails?) It is around a 2 minute walk to the footbridge which offers a lovely walk out to the beach. Great to lie in bed of a night and listen to the ocean. The only down side is the sea lido at the riverfront of the park which desperately needs to be dredged. This used to be an excellent swimming area but is now so full of sand it is only knee deep. Apart from that the park is well maintained and safe for families. The sites for tents and caravans are excellent and I would definitely recommend this park to everyone.",September 2017,Reflections Holiday Parks Urunga,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g529038-d1845552-Reviews-Reflections_Holiday_Parks_Urunga-Urunga_New_South_Wales.html,"Urunga, Australia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great seafood,"Always come to the co-op every time I am in Coffs. Visited twice in the past week and found the food still excellent. I had the crumbed flathead tails which were very fresh you could taste the ocean and the chips were lovely and crisp. My son had the crumbed whiting fillets and my grandson had the prawn cutlets, they both said they were delicious. The outside eating area is always packed but we were lucky enough to jag a table straight away. For the range of fresh seafood - prawns etc there was not much choice but we ended up getting the Eastern King Prawns for dinner that night back in Urunga - (bit pricey but were delicious).
You cannot go wrong with the food but be prepared for a crowd for the undercover seating. I remember when it was just a shed with plenty of local seafood but with no hot food.",September 2017,Coffs Harbour Fishermen's Co-Op,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255059-d1224664-Reviews-Coffs_Harbour_Fishermen_s_Co_Op-Coffs_Harbour_New_South_Wales.html,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Good food,Mainly Chinese cuisine but there are other options as well. The restaurant is a nice size with clean tableware and good service. We started with the mini Spring Rolls (10 in a serve) which were very crisp and served with a sweet and sour sauce.. I had the Garlic Beef which was very tasty and tender. My mother had the Honey Chicken which looked and smelt good. Both these meals were served with rice; you could choose boiled or fried. My grandson had the Chicken Snitzel that was huge. This was served with a side salad. The prawn chips were a bit on the oily side but that was the only downer on the meal.,September 2017,Urunga Bowling Club Chinese Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g529038-d3487770-Reviews-Urunga_Bowling_Club_Chinese_Restaurant-Urunga_New_South_Wales.html,"Urunga, Australia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Time for a change,"I always looked forward to Lunch at The View - that is until around 5 years ago and the food was not as good as it was and it was overpriced then. Having not visited for 5 years I thought maybe things had improved. Alas they hadn't. I ordered the Beer Batter Fish9 $25) (they do not have grilled anymore). When it arrived it looked delicious - and then I ate.
The chips were less than warm - the batter was oily and soggy and the fish was gluey. I do not know what fish it was but it definitely had a very high bouquet. The serving of rocket was soaked so much in dressing it just lay there limp. I would say the only good things were the lemon wedge and the aoili dressing in a separate dish. The wine ($8 per glass), about 5-6cm of it was served in a large glass and looked ridiculous.
I will not be visiting again that's for sure. I paid $33.00 for a meal that was inedible and no, I did not bring it to the attention of the staff as they seemed more disinterested than me.",September 2017,The View,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g552107-d8779626-Reviews-The_View-Mosman_Greater_Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Mosman, Australia",restaurants,2.0,3.5
The best Halibut,"In February there was not much on offer at Fisherman's Wharf so we opted for the Halibut takeaway from The Fish Store. The service was great and the food was excellent. The fish cooked to perfection, not too much batter or grease and the chips and coleslaw were nice and crunchy. Served with tartare sauce and lemon - it was overall a very filling and tasty meal. As we sat at the picnic tables and chairs out the front we were entertained by the local flipper brigade. You can buy small plates of raw fish for them and we had a wonderful time saying hello.",February 2017,The Fish Store at Fisherman's Wharf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154945-d3183310-Reviews-The_Fish_Store_at_Fisherman_s_Wharf-Victoria_Victoria_Capital_Regional_District_V.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
My favourite plane,I preferred to fly this route because the A380 to LAX was a disaster for me with insufficient leg room. The leg room on the 747 is OK and as I love flying there are virtually no complaints about this flight. Seat 52A was just behind the wing but noice cancelling headphones took out most of the noise. I will select further back next time. The preselection of meals on line was very good as was the food although the breakfast was not as good as it used to be. Overall I enjoyed the journey.,February 2017,Qantas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729133-Reviews-Qantas,World,flights,4.0,4.0

An adventurous time.,Due to severe storms and snow in Seattle our flight was delayed around 4 hours with the prospect of being cancelled altogether. The lady at the gate was extremely rude (yes she must have had a bad day) and could give us no information whatsoever. Another lady with a trainee badge was more than helpful (which has earned the Excellent rating) and updated us with information as soon as it came to hand - the other lady disappeared. The flight itself was enjoyable with the staff very friendly. Seat 9E was near the propeller but the noise was not a problem.

Disappointing and not what was advertised,"We were looking forward to the Half Day Multi Activity Tour and after what we had read on the web it promised to be a great time. Getting on the small bus in Whitehorse to take us up the mountain, the two guides/drivers were more intent on talking to each other about their personal night time activities and journeys and did not seem interested in any of us nor telling us about the countryside or what we were going to do. On arrival, we took turns at the different activities - my son-in-law and myself were snowmobiling first up and were given safety helmets just in case. This snowmobiling turned out to be the two guides on a snow mobile while we sat in a sled being dragged along behind. We stopped on the frozen lake to take photos. Next up was the dog sled - not as the ad says sit back and enjoy the scenery as you are pulled by a strong team of well-trained huskies - in actual fact it was sitting upright astride a plank of wood hanging on for grim death and not being able to enjoy anything especially as we took a corner too fast and ended up face down in the snow with the 'sled' on my leg. We stopped once to take photos. We gave the tobogganing a miss as it was not a gentle slope and the last activity was the snowshoe walk down the path and across the frozen lake. We did see some of our bus group who chose to do the ice fishing which entailed sitting in a chair with a line in a hole in the ice and we were shown how to dig a hole in the ice. Overall I was definitely not impressed with anything on this tour and felt that I had wasted my money. On the way back to Whitehorse the guides were back talking to themselves. At CAD195 per person - just a hint Up North - when you choose your guides they should have a bit of interest in the paying customers and your activities should reflect what you advertise.. We were very disappointed with this tour and would not recommend it to anyone, although maybe we just got a bad day.",February 2017,Up North Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g155047-d2476965-Reviews-Up_North_Adventures-Whitehorse_Yukon.html,"Whitehorse, Canada",attractions,2.0,4.5
Great location,"I stayed in a Deluxe King Suite with a water view - it had an excellent view over the harbour - so there is always something to look at if you are in the room. There was plenty of space for suitcases and enough power outlets to charge photo equipment. The large bathroom was very clean and the shower was of a good pressure. Overall the suite was great. Room service was a bit slow - had to call twice. We had breakfast in the Lure Restaurant on the main floor - good outlook. The orange juice was watered down and tasteless but the service was good. The dress code of the staff left a bit to be desired. For such a classy hotel I would have expected the staff to be dressed and not to be so casual. The valet service on arrival was very professional, on leaving is was more lay back with us having to wait about 20 minutes for the car. I would stay here again - -",February 2017,Delta Hotels Victoria Ocean Pointe Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g154945-d155900-Reviews-Delta_Hotels_Victoria_Ocean_Pointe_Resort-Victoria_Victoria_Capital_Regional_District_V.html,"Vancouver Island, Canada",hotels,5.0,4.5
Handy to airport but small rooms,"We choose this hotel because of the location - it is about 10-15 minute drive to Vancouver Airport but don't worry, there is no noise from the aircraft. Easy to find; check in was pleasant but the car parking is down a side alley and around the block and through a back entrance. Parking is secure; we parked up a few levels and near the entrance to the hallway and the elevators to the suites. We stayed for 2 nights - one going to Whitehorse and one coming back. The suite on the first evening was very small for 3 of us. Not much room at all in the bedrooms but the bathrooms seemed OK. Everything was clean so no problems there. We did have to ask for luggage racks as there were none provided in the suite. The kitchen area was spacious enough and well stocked with cutlery and crockery if you are staying for a few nights. On our return we requested a bigger suite - it was bigger but not much. Overall a good place to stay and I would definitely stay there again.",February 2017,Executive Hotel Vancouver Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g181716-d184309-Reviews-Executive_Hotel_Vancouver_Airport-Richmond_British_Columbia.html,"Richmond, Canada",hotels,4.0,3.5
Wonderful in Winter,"I have visited Mammoth Springs in Summer and it was incredible but this visit in February was even more spectacular. The amount of snow that covered the Lower Terrace of Palette Spring was breathtaking - the walk from the Terrace Grill was a bit uphill and in the drier, thinner air was a bit hard going but do-able even if you are not really fit. Granted- you do not get the multiple layers of trickling water at a great speed but it is something you have to see. I do not know if you can walk to the top from another area - did not have enough time to investigate.",February 2017,Mammoth Hot Springs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60999-d126750-Reviews-Mammoth_Hot_Springs-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming",attractions,5.0,4.5
Another one off the bucket list!,"Snow coaching into the Lodge was a great trip although the coach was a tad packed - maybe look at limiting the numbers in future - we arrived at night and the staff at check in were incredible - the only problem was one man who continually wanted to push his way in front of everyone. Just a hint - just because you are 'old' doesn't give you the right to be rude. My room was 2023 - very spacious and everything was clean including the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable. My morning view when I opened the shutters was l-o-n-g icicles hanging from the window and lots and lots of snow - incredible.
Within walking distance of Old Faithful and the trails - we had so much snow and had to be careful to walk in footsteps that were already there so that our legs didn't disappear from view. We did the Steam & Stars except that there were lots of clouds and no stars but we still had a great time just listening to the sounds of the night. Our guide Jesse was incredibly knowledgeable and the hot chocolate in the special mugs at the end of the tour was well received. We also did the Photo Tour with Lisa Culpepper, another great personality and helped us get some great photos. Once again, the snow coach was cramped. Xanterra must allow for people and their camera gear. We had two more tours which after finding out they were fully booked and not wanting the same cramped situation, we decided to cancel and book a full day private tour - this was great as we had the snow coach just for us and our cameras. Jenna was our guide and she was another who did a great job - taking us wherever we wanted to go. Consequently we went over the allotted time and had to pay extra but that didn't matter as we saw just about everything that Yellowstone had to offer.
The only really disappointing point staying at the Lodge was the Obsidian Grill. The first day for breakfast - the service and the food was great. After that it fell away for both breakfasts (buffet was nearly cold) and dinners. I ordered a steak on the second night and could not eat it as there was so much fat and gristle covered in sauce. Needless to say I gave the dinners here a miss until my last night and just ordered a salmon fillet with none of the fancy extras that went with it. Breakfasts on some mornings were fast paced with what seemed not enough staff to get the people in and out so that they did not have to rush when they had tours booked. The dinners were the same with us having to wait about an hour past our reservation time. The Geyser Grill was good for small meal/snacks but closed early. I think that Xanterra should look at the eating facilities as there doesn't seem to be enough to cope with the amount of people.
Overall - it was more positive than not and I would thoroughly recommend the Snow Lodge. The only reason I gave a Very Good and not Excellent was the lousy service in the Restaurant, the inedible steak and being crammed into Snow Coaches.",February 2017,Old Faithful Snow Lodge & Cabins,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60999-d145601-Reviews-Old_Faithful_Snow_Lodge_Cabins-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming",hotels,4.0,4.0
Not spectacular,"Stayed at the Snow Lodge and this restaurant was highly recommended. I found the a la carte breakfast and service on the first morning was excellent. Breakfasts from then on were from the buffet and nearly cold. Hint - get the food from the bottom of the tray - still not hot but better than on top. Service had fallen off - hardly anyone seemed interested especially when there were loads of people waiting for a table and some were worried they would miss their tours. Took forever to order toast. Maybe there should be a toaster at the buffet?
First Dinner and I was looking forward to the steak with mushrooms - it looked delicious when it arrived but I soon discovered it was very tough and fatty with lots of gristle. By the time I cut all that away the steak was about 2 inches square and I had lost my appetite. I only visited one more time for dinner and ordered a salmon fillet with mashed potatoes. The staff checked to see if that was what I really wanted as I did not want all the other extras. Looking around, the portions seemed large - sometimes too large but then again I am not a big eater. The surroundings were very rustic and most enjoyable and the chairs at the tables comfortable. There is a lot of things in my opinion that could be improved. Maybe I just struck a bad time.",February 2017,Obsidian Dining Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60999-d519503-Reviews-Obsidian_Dining_Room-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Better in Winter,"Have been in Summer when it is just too crowded and the wait time is long - this time Winter was the choice. Obviously the queues were non existent and the service was much better as they had plenty of time. Lunch consisted of a rather bland hot dog which was served with chips. My son-in-law had the chicken tenders which were still pink inside so had to be taken back. One good point - both the eating area and the amenities were clean.
Whilst waiting for the shuttle to the Snow Lodge we took a walk to the Lower Terraces which were not far away. Front steps tend to be icy so watch your step.",February 2017,Mammoth Terrace Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60999-d532460-Reviews-Mammoth_Terrace_Grill-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html,"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming",restaurants,3.0,3.0

Just breathtaking,"This is such an incredible Resort with hosts Wolfgang and Renate providing the ultimate in customer service. Catering for a small amount of guests, it is an easy 20 minutes drive out of Whitehorse where it offers solitude and opportunities to photograph the Northern Lights and skies without the glare of the city lights. The Chalets were immaculate - I was in the Enzian - my daughter and son-in-law in the Arnika and both were so comfortable and warm especially in the minus 30 degree temperatures outside. Home cooked meals are served in the main house and are delicious. Breakfasts are not the heavy usual but are light and enough to get you going to start the day. Dinners are incredible.

Good but not as good as the main Nicks Seafood.,"There were 17 of us for our work Christmas Lunch - seating was a bit cramped but that is to be expected as this time of year. A hot day - waiters brought out jugs of tap water with ice - unfortunately not enough time to cool down but enough to quench our thirst. The Antipasto Plate to share between 4 was OK - then we ordered the meals. For an entree - I had the Tempura Soft Shell crab with ginger and sweet chilli dipping sauce - was OK. The main I chose Grilled Fillet of Barramundi with creamy mashed potato, broccolini & sauteed spinach with lemon oil was nice but nothing flash. Dessert was typical pavlova but no fresh fruit only stewed strawberries and no passionfruit in the coulis - we paid $75 per person for the four courses. Just a word of advice to the chefs / waiters - put little flags on the steaks to say well done, medium rare etc. 3 of ours were incorrect and had to be returned. Everything was OK but I wouldn't go back.",December 2016,Nick's Bar and Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255060-d756787-Reviews-Nick_s_Bar_and_Grill-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",restaurants,3.0,3.5
