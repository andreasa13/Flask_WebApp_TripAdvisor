"Beautiful and relaxing,","On arrival and throughout our stay, Taylor at the front desk was super welcoming, friendly and helpful! She’s a great ambassador for Salishan. The Attic lounge had great food and drinks and a great staff, too. We love that the walkways are covered so you can get around the resort comfortably even in the rain. The setting is so beautiful and peaceful. Our room was clean and we loved the gas fireplace. Fun to walk on the private beach, too! No complaints. I recommend you give Salishan a try.",February 2021,Salishan Coastal Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g51885-d101949-Reviews-Salishan_Coastal_Lodge-Gleneden_Beach_Oregon.html,"Gleneden Beach, Oregon",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great location and good breakfast.,"Staff was nice, breakfast was good and location was great! You could walk anywhere and lots of restaurants and shopping nearby as well as most attractions. We were traveling with another couple, and I appreciated that they put us in a secluded part of the hotel with 2 rooms. The breakfast was good. They had a strange rule that you could only have 1 cappuccino but since the regular coffee was delicious it was ok.
If you go to Florence or anywhere it does not freeze, bring mosquito repellant, or be prepared to buy some. We had mosquitoes in our room and they gave us citronella plug ins but didn’t really help. The only other con was the beds were not at all comfortable. It was clean, though and had daily maid service if you wanted and WiFi.",November 2019,Hotel Palazzo Vecchio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187895-d239511-Reviews-Hotel_Palazzo_Vecchio-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",hotels,3.0,4.0

"Fun, interesting and beautiful!","The tour company we used was Walkabout. Our guide, Elisa, was great. The towns of Siena and San Gimignano were so cute and interesting. The farm we stopped at for lunch and wine tasting was charming and everything was delicious. It was great visiting with the other people on the tour. Day ended at Pisa, which was different than I thought it would be. I didn’t know more than the tower was there.

Super cool,"Just like you imagine, but just know there is always scaffolding and restoration efforts there so be prepared. I can’t imagine going in the summer when it’s hot and crowded. November was perfect and even more crowded than I would like.

Great location and clean,"We enjoyed the location of the hotel. Several good coffee places and a neat family owned cafe nearby. Walk to the Acropolis, Archaeological Museum, Plaka, etc. We did not find the beds to be very comfortable and there were only twins available even for couples. Staff was friendly and helpful.",November 2019,Attalos Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d235705-Reviews-Attalos_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
Great location and breakfast,"We really enjoyed the location. Everything we wanted to see except the Via Sacra was walkable. The breakfast and staff were very good!! In general the hotel and rooms were charming. Our room was a little dated, but it looked like they were starting to update several rooms in the hotel. The main thing our room needed was a new bedspread, but the bed itself was comfy. Hotels aren’t that important to us because we don’t spend much time in them so the bed being comfortable was most important. Otherwise it’s clean and a 3 star hotel in a great location. Staff was great and location was great.",November 2019,Hotel Virgilio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d231292-Reviews-Hotel_Virgilio-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,3.0,4.0
Gelato?! Go to Flavian - not Versace!!,My daughter and I did a taste test. The gelato place right across from the Wynwood Walls entrance is Versace. It was terrible compared to Flavian! It’s around the corner in a little mall but I can’t remember the name. But do yourself a favor and find Flavian if you want gelato. It was the best I’ve ever had and it’s a little less expensive than Versace.,June 2019,Flavian Gelateria Artigianale,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34438-d14176170-Reviews-Flavian_Gelateria_Artigianale-Miami_Florida.html,"Miami, Florida",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Delicious,"Really good food and homemade salsas, so be sure and get some chips and salsa. We had enchiladas that were very good. Margaritas were great and the prices aren’t too bad.",June 2019,Oh Mexico,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34439-d587683-Reviews-Oh_Mexico-Miami_Beach_Florida.html,"Miami Beach, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Mostly Good-Just a couple of small things,"Has its ups and downs. The ups are the staff is very nice, the grounds are lovely. The A/C units worked great. For an off beach hotel, the location is not bad. Note on transportation: parking is around $30 a day. We road Uber which was great, and there is a free trolley that goes up and down Collins that’s great. Just be aware that it doesn’t run late into the evening. The room was clean, but there was a bit of a mildew smell when we first walked in, however, it must not be a huge problem because we got used to it quickly. The room was clean and the housekeepers were. very good. The downs which aren’t really a big deal: there was no corkscrew, bottle opener or can opener in the kitchen. This seems ridiculous to me because people on vacation are going to want those items at their disposal. The office had them, but what an inconvenience to have to walk to the office for a can opener! The pool area is small for the size of the hotel. There aren’t enough chairs and umbrellas. I don’t know how often they clean the pool but by the 5th day we were there it was pretty gross. That was disappointing. Overall, though, it was a good place to stay.",June 2019,Tradewinds Apartment Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34439-d2018758-Reviews-Tradewinds_Apartment_Hotel-Miami_Beach_Florida.html,"Miami Beach, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.0
Really good!!,"It's Texas, it's BBQ, and it's delicious. We ate on a Friday night, so it was pretty crowded. We always eat in Lockhart on our way from Austin to Corpus Christi. I will also write a review for Black's, which we ate at on the way home. We were talking with a local gentleman in line and he told us that most local people eat at Chisolm Trail, and we believed him as every time we have ben there, we seemed like the only out-of-towners. I think the sides in both restaurants are comparable - both very good, and a lot of choices. I only had brisket, but it was delicious and very tender. My husband also had sausage and it was very good. To sum up - the food is delicious. If you want to experience a genuine Texas, small-town, no frills, BBQ restaurant, you should definitely check it out!",March 2015,Chisholm Trail Barbq,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56182-d848282-Reviews-Chisholm_Trail_Barbq-Lockhart_Texas.html,"Lockhart, Texas",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Delicious!!,"When we arrived at Black's at 4:00 on a Sunday, there was a line out the door and it only got longer. However, the line moved really quickly. The sides were comparable to other BBQ joints, but they did add a chipotle coleslaw that was very good. I thought there brisket was the best I've had in my life. They have a fun atmosphere and outdoor seating. I highly recommend eating at Black's if you are in or passing through Lockhart!",March 2015,Black's Barbecue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56182-d516589-Reviews-Black_s_Barbecue-Lockhart_Texas.html,"Lockhart, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Sunday brunch was excellent!,"I was a little worried, because I read several reviews that the brunch was not as good as it used to be due to a change in chefs. This was my first time eating Sunday brunch at Skamania, but I thought it was very good and comparable to brunch at other places I have eaten at, such as the Benson Hotel in DT Portland. The service was very good, our server was very attentive. The food was delicious and there was a lot of variety - from your normal breakfast fare to the meats and cheeses, fruit, desserts, etc. I would recommend it if you want a great brunch. Also, there are plenty of places to walk around or explore to work off a few of the calories, so bring tennis shoes!",January 2015,The Cascade Dining Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g58768-d2306894-Reviews-The_Cascade_Dining_Room-Stevenson_Washington.html,"Stevenson, Washington",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Delicious food!,They have great everything! Not you run of the mill lunch place as their dishes usually have more gourmet ingredients.,October 2013,Wild Pear,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g52053-d637979-Reviews-Wild_Pear-Salem_Oregon.html,"Salem, Oregon",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Not so good,"Used to be good when they first opened, but now it seems dirty and the food is not as good. We went there two times when they first opened and it was really good, so I do not know what happpened.

Reliable and a lot of variety,"Marco Polo is very consistent. They have a very extensive menu, so everyone should find something they like.

Couples-Eat in the bar,"My husband and I don't like to spend a lot on food on vacation. That is why we loved World Famous. They have happy hour food specials Mon - Thurs and the food is pretty god. Not fancy - but good. The drinks are not overpriced and good, too. We did eat breakfast on Sunday which was delicious!! If you are not picky and just want good grub, then I highly recommend happy hour in the bar and Sunday breakfast at World Famous. The view is great and we thought the service was great too!",June 2013,World Famous,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d539355-Reviews-World_Famous-San_Diego_California.html,"San Diego, California",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Pretty cool!!!!,"Everyone knows the zoo is famous. It is worth it. Be prepared to stand in line to see the pandas and koalas. I recommend taking the bus tour or riding the tram - but only if the line is not too long. Check the weather and go on the worst day. We went on an overcast day and all the zookeepers said that was the best time to come.

Awesome PB location!!,"My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary. Overall, we really enjoyed it. The good things - location is awesome. We walked the whole beachfront walk and decided we prefer the south side of the pier and the hotel is just in a perfect place. Close to restaurants, stores, etc. the hotel is older, but well kept. The rooms were clean and nice. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We arrived early and they gave us an access card for the restroom and the pool, and let us park in their lot. The debate able cons - it is a family hotel so there were a lot of kids. We did not go in the hot tub for that reason. There were always little kids in there and I feel they just can't help peeing in there. The pool was nice, though. One night only, thank goodness, there were some super loud and obnoxious college kids making noise until 2:30 a.m. The only con - you have to pay parking which is 18 bucks a day, so be prepared for that. It sucks but it is understandable that they have to charge, but that amount seems excessive. Overall, I recommend this hotel if you want to stay on Pacific Beach. I would stay here again for sure.",June 2013,Blue Sea Beach Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60750-d79907-Reviews-Blue_Sea_Beach_Hotel-San_Diego_California.html,"San Diego, California",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great Hotel!,"My family stayed 2 nights here. It was nice for the adults to have their own bedroom. Also, the full size refigerator and full kitchen were great options if you wanted to eat in or just have snacks (or ice creasm) available. There is an Albertson's grocery store just a couple of blocks away. The staff were friendly, the rooms were clean, and the lobby always had cookies and apples available for free! The location was great - really easy to get into downtown Seattle from the hotel.",October 2012,Larkspur Landing Bellevue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g58349-d543265-Reviews-Larkspur_Landing_Bellevue-Bellevue_Washington.html,"Bellevue, Washington",hotels,4.0,4.0
