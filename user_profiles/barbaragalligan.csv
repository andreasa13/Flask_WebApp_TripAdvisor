Superb,Great hotel. Great service. Requested quiet room as I was on a business trip and the staff were very good in sorting me out.

Will not return,I was starving after a long day of shopping around the beautiful city. First of all I was rushed into making an order which I didn’t appreciate. It felt as I was more of a nuisance rather than a customer. I went for the fish and chips and it tasted like the chips were cooked before and just thrown out to me to get rid of. Will not be returning.,March 2019,Gallaghers Gastro Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186600-d5502287-Reviews-Gallaghers_Gastro_Pub-Cork_County_Cork.html,"Cork, Ireland",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Overhyped,"Heard so much about this place so I said I had to try it out. When I got there, I was waiting for a seat even though there was free tables available. I got the eggs benedict and one egg was runny but the other one was hard boiled which really put me off. Overhyped for my liking.",March 2019,Liberty Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186600-d798523-Reviews-Liberty_Grill-Cork_County_Cork.html,"Cork, Ireland",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Service is top,Stayed there for work and they were very accommodating. Baked cod tasted very fishy and also requested fish for breakfast but they said they couldn’t do it,October 2018,Linden Tree Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315875-d1163848-Reviews-Linden_Tree_Restaurant-Maynooth_County_Kildare.html,"Maynooth, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good value and selection,"Set Menu €36 was good value. Nice selection to suit everyone and keep them happy. Usual chicken, steak and fish. Nice setting by the river. Looks very posh on the outside but they are very welcoming to everyone",October 2018,The Kingsley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186600-d7365224-Reviews-The_Kingsley-Cork_County_Cork.html,"Cork, Ireland",restaurants,4.0,3.5
VERY FRESH fish.,A fancy beach hut that is one hell of a treat. We were here on easter Sunday and I'm glad we booked. Delicious fresh fish in a very upbeat atmosphere. The only room for improvement would be the speed of service,April 2018,2 Passos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g262054-d1071835-Reviews-2_Passos-Almancil_Loule_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Almancil, Portugal",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Excellent service,Prawn & Crab Dumplings - Too much chilli and a little rubbery but very filling.
