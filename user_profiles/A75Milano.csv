Cradle of Western Civilization,"We Westerns all belong to this site.
Visit is a must even if you've already been here like me.
Access is easy and visit worth at least half a day.",August 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Trip to Thermopylae,"Thermopylae is one of the most significant place in the Western Civilization History and I always dreamed to get there.
Finally I did, thank to Exceptional Journey, reconmended by Electra Palace, my Hotel in Athens, which provided me a very professional, expert, educated, nice and good English Speaker Driver, Nikolaus, who smoothly brought me there and back in total safety, with nice and well equipped car but first of all giving me lots of details about the site, its amazing history and Greece and its culture in general.
He was not a simple Driver (even if he drives perfectly, smoothly and in total safety) but a true Guide, with a wide ad deep knowledge in many fields, from history to geography and geology (he used to work as geologist too).
Visit went through perfectly and I did enjoy it, it's been a unique experience.
When you want a dream to become true you always expect everything to work perfectly, not always possible but this time it was. Well worth the fare and driving time from Athens.
I strongly reconmend myself Exceptional Journey and Nikolaus as well.",August 2020,Exceptional Journey DMC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d11951795-Reviews-Exceptional_Journey_DMC-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
