Breathtaking,Family visit to Athens and of course just had to visit the Acropolis! It really is something you’ll remember forever. It’s absolutely beautiful and the whole site and views over the city are amazing. Don’t leave Athens without visiting - it’s a must.,February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Perfect Location,"We stayed here during mid February for 5 nights. The location is absolutely perfect for a short break to NY. Right in times square and in the hustle of the city, and close enough to catch the buses to the other sightseeing places. Rooms nice, spacious, clean and quiet despite being in the a busy part of the city. Would definitely stay again. Breakfast is very expensive, and we only ate there once on the last morning. Bar is nice, is a real hive of activity in the hotel day and night.",February 2018,Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d93454-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_Times_Square_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,5.0,4.0
Very impressed,"We stayed here for one night and were very impressed. The service was great, rooms nice, very clean and had everything we needed. The food in the bar was very nice, good price and the waitresses were so friendly and attentive. The grounds were beautiful and just wish we had more time for a walk around outside. Price for the rooms was definitely value for money and will be visiting again when visiting the area.",September 2017,Worplesdon Place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g658237-d1631093-Reviews-Worplesdon_Place-Worplesdon_Guildford_Surrey_England.html,"Worplesdon, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,3.5
Absolutely lovely..,"We stayed here on a last minute decision to spend the day and night on the coast. Had never been to Overstrand before but Cromer lots of times and we were so amazed at the beautiful beach and quaint little village. The Hotel was lovely, good price and very clean, the staff were exceptional, evening meal was gorgeous and breakfast great too. The only reason I'm dropping from a 5 to 4 star is due to the bed.. it was comfy but soooo ridiculously squeaky every time I moved it woke me up, so not the best nights sleep, other than that it was a great choice and I would highly recommend both the hotel and restaurant here. (For management in case no-one has told you it's Room 1 - the double bed)",August 2017,The White Horse Overstrand,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1648063-d1520620-Reviews-The_White_Horse_Overstrand-Overstrand_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Overstrand, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Quaint hotel with lots of history,"We stayed here for the location as had a meeting near Woking. Staff were lovely, very friendly and attentive. Rooms were nice, although pretty hot. Breakfast was a good selection of continental, fruit and cooked breakfast. The bar and restaurant areas are very nice with decor fresh and contemporary. Only thing for me which wasn't as good as I hoped was the evening meal, the menu looked good and we all had 2 courses and 2 of us had desserts too. I don't feel it was upto par for the rest of the feel of the hotel and the first class service, so although just okay I wouldn't be rushing back for dinner there which was disappointing.",August 2017,The Talbot Inn Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g3380117-d1223049-Reviews-The_Talbot_Inn_Hotel-Ripley_Woking_Surrey_England.html,"Ripley, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,3.5
Really enjoyable,"Had a trip on Friday morning with Lets go Punting. Our chauffeur was Will, and our trip was great fun, it took around an hour to go up and back along the river seeing all the Uni's/colleges, Will was knowledgable and made the trip really fun. Would definitely recommend Lets Go Punting to friends.",June 2017,Lets Go Punting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186225-d2060456-Reviews-Lets_Go_Punting-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
Beautiful hotel in centre of City,"Stayed for a romantic night in Cambridge and chose the Varsity. We were upgraded on arrival and were given a beautiful huge room with a luxury bathroom too. Location is perfect, very central to the city centre, and with free guest access to the spa with sauna, steam room and jacuzzi overlooking the river made this a perfect choice. Would definitely recommend to others for a lovely hotel and great location for visiting the city.",June 2017,The Varsity Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186225-d1845634-Reviews-The_Varsity_Hotel_Spa-Cambridge_Cambridgeshire_England.html,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great on a nice day for overlooking the city,Nice roof top terrace with great views overlooking the city. It was pretty quiet when we were up there but I can imagine it gets busy in the height of the season/hot days.

"Clean, fun and pleasantly surprised","We visited for Easter weekend (family of 4 of us with our 2 dogs). We were very pleased with our accommodation, it was spotlessly clean, right by the beach and near enough to clubhouse/restaurant etc. The site, although full, was pretty quiet - no noisy neighbours. The reception staff were helpful, shop very well stocked and the main bar had entertainment on all weekend, with a great arcade and indoor play area if you have young kids. We ate in the Restaurant and although it was an hour wait (which we were advised of when we ordered), the food was good and not overpriced. Overall a very good weekend.",April 2017,Kessingland Beach Holiday Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1464316-d655140-Reviews-Kessingland_Beach_Holiday_Park-Kessingland_Suffolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Kessingland, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,3.5
Lovely little place,We stopped by for a drink at the Waterfront when staying at Kessingland Beach Resort (just a short walk away) after our long walk on the beach. It was really nice to sit and look out at the sea and just relax on the front terrace with the dogs. We had a drink and a sharing platter and it was really lovely:).,April 2017,The Waterfront Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1464316-d1464317-Reviews-The_Waterfront_Restaurant-Kessingland_Suffolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Kessingland, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Great practice slope,"I took my daughter for a 3 hour session with her friend to do a little practice before getting back on the real slopes. Went in half term and was very busy, but seemed to be well run getting skis etc and waiting time for drags was minimal. Definitely need to book as gets super busy.

Always a lovely visit,"One of my favourite restaurants around Covent Garden, always lovely food and great service, we always spend too much as order special dishes and fine wine but as a not-so-regular treat it's allowed.

Magical,"We saw the show 10years ago and always wanted to go again to soak in this totally enchanting show. Was not disappointed it was totally captivating from the very start! I recommend this show to everyone, absolutely loved it, a truly incredible show.",January 2017,The Lion King,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d1766159-Reviews-The_Lion_King-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
What a gem,We went to see the Lion the witch & the wardrobe and it was absolutely lovely! I'd not been to this quaint little theatre before and it was a real surprise at how well run the whole production and theatre was. All seats appeared to have a great view as the seats are all well elevated so you don't get a head blocking your vision. A great price for tickets and a brilliant performance.

Enjoyable stay,"Used this hotel as it was the ideal location for our plans. Checked in very late, which we phoned them up to pre-warn and was not an issue. Service desk and concierge were very helpful. Bedroom small but comfortable and clean, had all we need, comfy beds and not too hot in the room!. We never had breakfast booked as we had to leave early, so can't comment on the food.

The Railway Children - Just okay,"I took my young teen daughter to see this show and we were really looking forward to it. Perfect location when coming into London by train as just a short walk from Kings Cross station. The tickets were reasonably priced compared to most West End shows - my naivety in thinking it would be on-par with them. The entrance area is twee, but with only a few chairs available, they could do with more as the area got pretty busy ""pre-show"" with no-where for most to sit. The theatre is not really a theatre, more a temporary structure used as a theatre. A shame that we possibly had the worst seats in the house (which we were automatically allocated, so never knew) right by the stairs the cast used to come on and off stage (far left corner at the very back), so really noisy and very cramped up against the material covered scaffolding. The show was ""okay"" but no-where near on par with the West End shows (so don't go here instead of the West End shows). We left at the interval as got bored and it was not the level of show we had hoped for. Probably okay to take young children to and that's about it. To be truthful I wish I had paid more to see a much better show.",October 2016,King's Cross Theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d7351965-Reviews-King_s_Cross_Theatre-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.0
"Okay food, but the service...","I'm giving this an average only on the fact the food was okay. The most bizarre food encounter I have experienced and I'm a regular visitor to London. Now to be fair this was my first visit to this restaurant so I went up, looked at the board, ordered 2 things and was shuffled along. I was then asked questions on what salad choice I wanted etc etc, and I was thinking do I get salad with it?, okay I'll have that and that... moved along, moved along. Got to the end and had 4 meals none of which I ordered and was very confused thinking they've given me the wrong order. No-one seemed to have more than broken English and no-one even seemed to know what I ordered, after being passed over to the best English speaker (slightly above broken) my deal was finally made on what I had ordered, but good grief what a rigmarole for 1 quesadilla and whatever else it was I ordered. The man behind me had no idea what to do or order so after he saw my palaver decided to go to McDonalds. Had to laugh as was just so ridiculous.",October 2016,Tortilla King's Cross,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d9758485-Reviews-Tortilla_King_s_Cross-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.5
"Good location, nice hotel","Stayed just one night for business trip, staff were very helpful and room was small but clean, modern and comfy. Was in a good location, and around £11.00 taxi ride to train station. Cost was a little pricey at £115 for a single person (exc breakfast) but would stay again for business due to location.",June 2016,Ibis Bristol Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186220-d607872-Reviews-Ibis_Bristol_Centre-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Great location for Kings X/St Pancras train station,"Stayed here for a business trip in Kings x after arriving at Kings x station, so location was perfect. Room was miniature as was shower and beds but staff friendly and rooms clean albeit a little tired looking. To be fair I slept very well for having a ground floor road side room. Breakfast very basic but all in all at £60 a night for a single room the price was acceptable. It's certainly not luxury, but if you just want a bed for a couple of nights for budget business trips or for tourists coming in and out of the train station this is a fair choice.",June 2016,Belgrove Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d483455-Reviews-Belgrove_Hotel-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,2.5

Really nice hotel,"Stayed for 1 night and were upgraded to a superior room upon arrival. Was a really nice room, large, clean, modern and we slept very well.

Nice farm & worth visiting,"Walked here from Wroxham - around 1.5 miles - took about half an hour or so to walk it. Took the dog - we could only sit outside/outside cafe area with dog, but had googled ahead so were aware, and you don't pay until you go into the farm so that was good - so husband waited outside whilst I went in the farm area with daughter. Has some nice craft shops and a cider shop too separate from Farm. The farm was really nice, clean and we were able to pet goats and sheep plus feed the lambs.
