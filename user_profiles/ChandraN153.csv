Acropolis - nice sight,"Try to go early in the morning so that the crowd is less. Also take a camera with a good telephoto lens. you have nice views of the city.
However be very careful of thieves. They are all over the place. The public and police do nothing about it. They snatch anything from tourists. They dont target locals.

Not cashless,"They dont accept cards and charge 4% extra for card payments.
They have displayed some outdated government circulars and showed them to me for not accepting card payments. Usually as travellers we dont have to carry much cash.
