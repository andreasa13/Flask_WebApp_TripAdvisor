Fascinating timeline,"The exhibits are arranged by time, from the earliest prehistory to the Greek classic age. There is a wing of Egyptian artifacts which relate interestingly to Greece. The cafe is nice for a juice and coffee break. Don't miss the beautiful artifacts in the cafe courtyard.",April 2019,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
The best meat we've eaten in a long time!,"This was the best dinner we had in Athens. We had the fried cheese, Greek salad, and meat platter without pork and with added lamb. It was absolutely delicious. The portions were huge, and the leftovers the next day were still incredible. Highly recommend!",April 2019,Avgerinos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12908815-Reviews-Avgerinos-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Perfect timing at 8 a.m.!,"This place is incredibly beautiful, and well worth the time. We got to the line at 8 a.m. and it only took a few minutes to get our tickets and enter. At around 9 a.m., a military flag detail raised the Greek flag at the north-east end with great ceremony.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wonderful,Very well done museum! All the captions were in Greek and English. We and our kids will never forget it.,April 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Cheap and decent,"We took the KTEL bus from the stop near PHIX metro station in Athens to the Temple of Poseidon in Sounio. The price for the trip one-way was 6.90 per person. I found the website difficult to use, but they answered emailed English questions very quickly!

The website timetable shows the times the bus leaves their main stop in central Athens. It took about 10 minutes to reach the stop at PHIX. The correct bus stop had a paper sign, and was in front of Goody's Burger House at Leof. Andrea Siggrou 70, Athina 117 42, Greece. Everyone got on and sat down, and those who got off at the earlier stops paid the clerk in the front of the bus as they got off. About 2/3 of the way through the 2-hour trip, the clerk went through the bus collecting the ticket price in CASH only and printing tickets on a handheld machine. Some people bought round trip tickets and were told not to lose that paper.

The 10 a.m. bus was quite full in late April, so I imagine it will be more so in the summer. The windows were somewhat smudged so it was hard to take good photos, but the views along the drive were beautiful and it was nice to be able to relax and see everything instead of worrying about driving. We would use the KTEL bus again.",April 2019,KTEL Attikis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12919607-Reviews-KTEL_Attikis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,2.5
Delicious snack or light lunch,"Less expensive and crowded than the area nearer the Acropolis. The taboulleh salad and the sweet barbecued chicken were really good, and so were the cherry lemonades.",April 2019,Svoura,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d7352507-Reviews-Svoura-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Very easy, worth the money","Our driver met us just as planned. The assigned driver changed while we were flying, but Welcome Pickups sent the new info via email. The driver, Chanis, was great at managing the crazy Athens traffic, and we didn't have to manage the metro with kids! We'd use Welcome Pickups again.",April 2019,Welcome Pickups,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d8609163-Reviews-Welcome_Pickups-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
