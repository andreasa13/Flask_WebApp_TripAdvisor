"Yes, it really is THAT amazing.","My pictures do not do it justice but my memories will stay with me forever.
We had a guide - I like to know all the details and history - and would recommend that for you if you like history and explanations of the remarkable water system.
Well worth it to hike further to The Monastery and then further from their to Suicide View. Spectacular views and once you get to the monastery, the crowd is noticeably thinner.
We packed in a light lunch from items from the breakfast buffet at our hotel. There are two buffet restaurants on the site but we didn’t need that much to eat and they were around 20 JD.
I tried my best to resist the hawkers. Once you say no, they leave you alone. They were not aggressive which can worry N Americans.",April 2019,Petra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g318895-d319461-Reviews-Petra-Petra_Wadi_Musa_Ma_an_Governorate.html,"Petra - Wadi Musa, Jordan",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great view nice place,"Located about 10 minutes from the visitors centre at Petra, the Marriott is the one hotel that had a shuttle that runs on the hour from the site. That was very helpful as we did an extended hike.
The rooms are clean and up-to-date; the hotel is quite new.
Good food and a great view.
We were especially impressed with the exceptionally friendly and helpful staff they went out of their way to accommodate us.
I also visited the spa. After a day of hiking, the hammam and a tranquility massage were just right.",April 2019,Petra Marriott Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g318895-d299802-Reviews-Petra_Marriott_Hotel-Petra_Wadi_Musa_Ma_an_Governorate.html,"Petra - Wadi Musa, Jordan",hotels,4.0,4.0
Relax and float!,"We had two nights at the Marriott at the end of a two week Middle East tour.
The food was delicious with a wide variety. We ate breakfast and dinner.
The rooms were immaculate.
The pools were clean and inviting with lots of seating.
The big attraction, of course, was floating in the sea. An experience not to be missed.
After many hotels through three countries, the staff at this Marriott were exceptionally helpful, friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us.
Jordan was incredibly safe and the people throughout were friendly. Do not miss an opportunity to visit this remarkable country.",April 2019,Dead Sea Marriott Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g951923-d299801-Reviews-Dead_Sea_Marriott_Resort_Spa-Sweimah_Dead_Sea_Region.html,"Sweimah, Jordan",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Interesting drive, HOT springs!","We hired a car for 135JD but there were a number of tourists in rental cars and the highway was not crowded and was easy to navigate.
The drive from the Marriott was fascinating. As soon as you turn off the highway, you understand why The Martian was filmed in Jordan! The only sound was the bells on the goats that scramble over the rocks and silt.
The springs are extremely hot and unlike the ones we’ve visited in N America, they are waterfalls! Very neat. While we were there, the main waterfall was diverted for shoring up and expanding. It will be amazing.",April 2019,Ma'in Hot Springs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g319816-d320532-Reviews-Ma_in_Hot_Springs-Ma_in_Ma_an_Governorate.html,"Ma'in, Jordan",attractions,4.0,4.0

Modern, environmentally conscious with classy touches such as different inspiring quotations in each room, lovely toiletries and tea/coffee/biscuits available all day.

Absolutely lovely,"What a wonderful hotel! Two short blocks away from the city walls and those blocks are lined with beautiful Georgian and Victorian houses so it’s a nice walk.
The staff were very welcoming and friendly. The breakfast was delicious with lots of choices. But it’s the atmosphere (a former orphanage!) and the beautifully sumptuous rooms (outstandingly comfortable beds!) that make this a highly recommended place to stay!",May 2018,Hotel du Vin York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186346-d754530-Reviews-Hotel_du_Vin_York-York_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"York, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Pay to go up the tower!,"We love a great cathedral and Yorkminster is that! The beautiful stained glass windows, effigies and stonework are outstanding.

Not to be missed,My friend and I ended up here after discovering the more commercial Chocolate Story was closed for the day. A young man at the tourist info centre across the road pointed it out to us. We just happened to turn up in time for a tasting. This is well worth the price (I think it was £6? Can’t remember the exact cost). Not only was it a fascinating and informative experience but we were allowed to try any of the buttons or truffles from the expected (peppermint) to the exotic (blue cheese? Delicious!) we were even treated to tastes of the single source bars that had hints of the crops that grew near the cocoa plant. A hidden gem and I can’t recommend it highly enough(and their chocolate too!).,May 2018,York Cocoa House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186346-d2453094-Reviews-York_Cocoa_House-York_North_Yorkshire_England.html,"York, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Beautiful anytime of the year!,"The Muttart is a wonderful space for couples, families or groups.

What a treat!,"First, what a cool idea to have a Steve Mcqueen themed hotel. But the theme is not kitschy- it’s subtle and cool. And there’s quirky touches throughout (the recorded voice on the elevator, the window warnings...). Sure the rooms are great, the beds are comfortable and the location is perfect (near all the trendy shopping and lovely restaurants) but don’t come for those things: come for the absolutely fabulous customer service. We do a lot of touring and this is by far one of the most exceptional places for helpful, thoughtful staff. From the lovely young man who arranged for hotel pick up for our bus tour to the other wonderful young man who gave my husband the gourmet doughnut when we were late coming back and the case had been cleaned out.

Anticlimactic,"First, the book itself and the library are lovely. They are not to be missed if you are a historian, bibliophile or educator. Too bad there wasn’t better organization or tours to move people through and emphasize the significance of both and to point out the unique features of the library. I booked what was supposed to be a tour but wasn’t. It was entry fee and a free-for-all of pushy people butting in around the case. There was no sense of organization. I saw a sign that an audio tour was not available for another few weeks. Hopeful that will make this a more interactive and informative tour.",May 2018,The Book of Kells and the Old Library Exhibition,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d215062-Reviews-The_Book_of_Kells_and_the_Old_Library_Exhibition-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,3.0,4.5
I don’t like beer ... but this I liked!,"What an amazing tour through production, advertising and tasting of Guinness stout. Very cleverly designed, well-organized and informative.

"Too far, by far!","This review is for visitors who are tourists without cars. On the map, it show the tram stop as very close. Do not be deceived - that stop is a 20 minute walk up and over a major motorway. When you’re dragging your luggage, it’s quite the hike.
Also, as you take the tram from central Dublin, and it starts into the car sales lots and industrial sites, you realize this is not a walking area/neighbourhood.
There were very few rooms available in Dublin for the three nights we needed but as tourists, we would have been better off paying the higher prices to be better located and able to walk in the city.
The rooms are clean but there is no control over the temperature or airflow in the room so it’s stuffy. The front desk was very nice and brought a fan. Again, not a tourist hotel so no suggestions of places to eat, sights to see from the hotel. Could be because it’s in an industrial area.",June 2018,Red Cow Moran Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580196-d212685-Reviews-Red_Cow_Moran_Hotel-Clondalkin_County_Dublin.html,"Clondalkin, Ireland",hotels,3.0,4.0
Lovely!,"Lovely surprise right on the hop on/off route and free entry with hop on/off ticket. A people’s museum, full of fascinating bits and pieces donated to the library, our guide Romeo was entertaining and extremely knowledgeable. You’ve got to love a place that has a U2 room, a delivery list from the Magdalene Laundries and a photo of Christie Brown all in one place! The temporary installation was about women in Dublin - again, very thoughtful as well as thought provoking.",May 2018,The Little Museum of Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d2306703-Reviews-The_Little_Museum_of_Dublin-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fascinating - not to be missed!!,"Warning: book on line- this site lets people in only on their tours and they sell out!
Tremendously informative displays about Irish resistance over the years (including the Finians in N America), lots of information about prison life and design, and a historically important site. Whether you’re a fan of architecture, history or penal codes this is a great site to see. Very informative guide focused on the 1916 uprising.

Giant’s Causeway,"A quick trip to Belfast and we wanted to see a bit of the countryside. Perfect tour for this. Very reasonably priced for what you get (a full day of touring, knowledgeable guide). They “picked us up “ at our hotel which involved one guide walking us over to the general pick up a few blocks away, which was perfectly fine (we felt dumb not realizing it was so close!).

Let's look at it from my perspective:
Wonderful musicians open the show. Very skilled, traditional music, traditional instruments. Lovely!
The puppet show was mesmerizing. Traditional stories that while there was no translation of the parts with dialogue, I found I could follow the stories. With the ten or so traditional tales, they're short enough so I could follow along without too much confusion.

Exceptional BBQ - just like Southern US,"From the smoky aroma that wafts through the door to the homemade BBQ sauces, this is an authentic, delicious locally-owned operation. We have eaten in and had take out. Amazing- not to be missed. The brisket is cooked to perfection. Mmmmmm",September 2016,That Bar-B-Q Place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g499109-d4513653-Reviews-That_Bar_B_Q_Place-Sherwood_Park_Strathcona_County_Alberta.html,"Sherwood Park, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Doesn't disappoint!!,"I have heard of Duchess for a few years but was never in that part of town. We made a special trip there on Saturday and , boy! was it EVER worth it. We tried scones (blueberry/lemon and choc/orange), macarons (rose and lemon ) , macaron cake(coconut, raspberry and white chocolate filling) croissants (cheese and cheese and leek). Absolutely everything was absolutely delicious. As in Europe, the treats come in individual and larger sizes.",September 2016,Duchess Bake Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g154914-d2546034-Reviews-Duchess_Bake_Shop-Edmonton_Alberta.html,"Edmonton, Canada",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Clean and great location,"Breakfast (cereals, muffins, toast etc) was fresh and good (also included!). Basic room but it was clean. Nice staff.

Lives up to the rave reviews!,We made a special trip to find the store and were not disappointed. Delicious doughnuts with the taste and texture of homemade and with clever twists.

Beautiful!,"What a tremendous space. Well worth the look around inside. Wish we had been there for a concert. The gift store has many beautiful items but is expensive, possibly because of the proximity to cruise ships' dock.",August 2016,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189970-d2108615-Reviews-Harpa_Reykjavik_Concert_Hall_and_Conference_Centre-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great price!,"We booked this at the last minute because a food tour fell through. They guarantee you'll see puffins, probably because puffins return to their nesting sites and stay from May until the end of August.

Well worth the ticket!,Visiting inside the church is free. We were lucky to catch the church organist playing a selection of hymns. The acoustics in the church are amazing and the enormous pipes fill the space with sound. Buy the 6kroner ticket at the church office to take the elevator to the top of the spire.

Good Viking info,"The remains of a Viking longhouse and some excellent slides on the genome and language of Iceland. Original medieval manuscripts too but you have to pay extra to view them.
