Great place. Silly name.,"Don't be put off by the silly name. It is very good and lots of interesting things to do. Only thing I would say is that the atmosphere inside is quite stuffy and makes you feel sleepy. Hard to stay lively and enthusiastic for the kids. Maybe they should have called it We Be The Curious, to make it sound more Bristolian. It used to be called @Bristol which is equally strange.

An abundance of mouldy fruit and veg,An abundance of mouldy and rotten and well-past-its-best fruit and veg. Prices of fruit and veg reflect the fact it is supposedly organic. But it's mouldy and mushy and rotten so rubbish.

Everything was excellent.,"Thanks again to all the staff. We never SAW a smile but we think that everyone was smiling behind their mask . Everything was excellent. The location, the facilities, spotlessly clean, beautiful water quality in all 3 pools. Great gym, VERY VERY helpful reception - booking tennis for us at Club de Campo, gave first aid, free mask, loads of help and advice.

Fantastic breakfasts, extra coffee as needed, very high quality food and excellent service. Such a lovely experience as it is so nice to be ‘looked after’ on any Ibiza holiday which can take its toll on the senses!

Cannot recommend highly enough. 5 stars all the way.

12 July 2020,"Information only. It is open but you have to reserve sunsets in advance. Evenings - I would suggest avoid. Last night we went down and the disco inside was on and looked OK but very blokey and not many people inside.

Family with teenagers - excellent long weekend,"We all had a really excellent 3 nights at this hotel. They gave us two rooms next door to each other, they gave us friendly and precise help and advice whenever we asked, the room service staff gave us excellent room service whenever we needed it, the breakfast was pretty good (not outstanding but pretty good), the rooms were very clean and good linen and the room cleaner was very nice and very friendly and helpful. At the end of the trip I left my keys in the room and they very kindly posted them to me in the UK, without charging me. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel...the location is excellent and you are proper 'in Athens'. Locally there are loads of Indian and middle-east influenced cafes and takeaways that are very cheap and very good holiday food...the kids loved it. Also, within a few streets - loads of little squares with eat outside facilities. You can walk everywhere from this hotel, and if not, it is near the metro. We walked everywhere and we all had a brilliant time.

Thank you everyone at Dorian Inn. We will be back to see you again as soon as we can.

Excellent for all the family,"Very good. It was free entry on the day we visited. I would advise going early in the summer.; we went in March and it was fine, but it is a bit of a hike up and little shade so, in intense heat may be a little uncomfortable.

The only bad thing was many many men approaching us trying to chat to us and sell wrist bands. Too much of this. Also, on the way down, two men tried to pickpocket my partner's backpack.

Disappointing when you realise the down side,"This rooftop restaurant is separate to the hotel it is in.

The hotel is great in every way but the rooftop restaurant can confuse people because you are entering a different domain.

The views are fantastic and the pool area is very nice and clean. The service I got was generally very good overall, regarding service and quality, and the portions and speed of delivery of the food our family had at lunch was excellent. However, the staff (particularly the evening staff, and particularly one male barman) can be very snooty. At 5pm they close the pool and its little sunbathing area. Presumably because from 5pm is 'their' time, not the hotel's time. This was very hard on my kids as they were hounded out of the pool at 4.59pm when the sun was fully shining. I also saw a hen party at 5.15pm not even allowed by the waiter to go out there for a photo by the pool. Also, I was told to go away because I was wearing a pair of the hotel's slippers instead of proper shoes more in keeping with a RESTAURANT.

The Point Of View restaurant is NOT the room service hub (that is on the first floor and a different phone number from the rooms), so you can not ask to borrow a corkscrew for example - IT IS A RESTAURANT - they announce snootily.",March 2020,Point Of View,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3983703-Reviews-Point_Of_View-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0

"No decent lager to drink, not even bottles","Whatever has happened to bar owners' perception of their punters? Have some of you forgotten that lager is drunk in huge volumes in every bar in Britain? And have you forgotten that if you are going to provide lager, which you would be foolish not to, there are about a thousand known brands to choose from. If you can't get these household-name brands from your supplier (very hard to believe) you can easily get all of them from any cash and carry or Asda.

How can it be possible that I visited a large bar in central Bristol - even a pop-up - and there was NO lager? The only single lager on tap - which was only producing froth - was Sulis, by some dodgy English brewer, Bath Ales I think, trying to mimick the very well established German pilsner style that so many of us know and love. It isn't lager actually, it's just wishy washy stuff. Kubik Pale Ale alongside it - just as bad. Anyway, not lager.

Not even any bottles of lager. Nothing. No Christmas Belgian beer, no Staropramen or Budweiser Budvar to give us a wintery lager experience of colder places in the east of Europe.

Rubbish. Not recommended. Staff were helpful but mainly there to socialise amongst themselves and there was someone asleep in one of the 'lounge bar' areas. Wouldn't it be nice to have something like - a German Christmas Market with German lager in steins? Had anyone thought that might be much better than this crappy Apres bar? If I go back to Millennium Square this month, which I probably will, I will be taking my own lager in bottles. Plenty of places to sit, away from the Apes Bar.",December 2019,Après Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186220-d13229154-Reviews-Apres_Bar-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",attractions,2.0,2.0
"Family of 5 (inc. 3 teenagers), October... fantastic holiday. Great place.","I booked a Centerparcs trip, they gave us a holiday. This park is like a mini Longleat (which is our local UK Centerparcs) but the strapline ‘the holiday the weather can’t spoil’ is the most important part. As it happens, the weather was glorious and we did family bike rides on the myriad of clearly-posted flat Cycle Routes around the lake, spent a lot of time outside and at the farmyard zoo and adventure golf, etc. But the swimming paradise is always there to fall back on and the one here is just as much fun as it needs to be.
We did the flowrider twice, which is extremely good value for money at 11 euros each for a whole hour. And we had lunch in the pool complex once.

What did it for me was the entertainment hall. There was something going on whenever we went there. Great fun, excellent stage shows and great entertainment from the animation team. Table bar service, so none of that HORRIBLE post-office style queuing up at the Sports Village in Longleat. Speaking of that place, yes, I missed the racquet sports and the gym, as there is no sports hall at De Eemhof. But I did go on a serious 30km bike ride which I would not have done at Longleat.",October 2019,Center Parcs - De Eemhof,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g652192-d669535-Reviews-Center_Parcs_De_Eemhof-Zeewolde_Flevoland_Province.html,"Zeewolde, The Netherlands",hotels,5.0,3.5
A brilliant stop in the centre of town for European travellers and everyone else,"I first went on holiday to Mangalore in 2002. The Liqud Lounge was just getting started there. Since then, many many times every year (except sadly 2 or 3 :( ) we always hang out there on our stays in the city. The staff are always excellent and remember us and cannot do enough for us. I have had so many of my best ever times in India in this place. All family members, even the youngest kids were and are always welcomed with open arms. The family that own it are lovely and we have a great affection for this place and the owners and staff.

Lovely swimming pool,"We had a great time at this stopover campsite but only because it has some key facilities. Some animals to feed, which is great, some open field space for ball games, and a lovely fantastic indoor tropical multi-function pool.

But this campsite is characterised by old-fashioned campsite traits and overbearing administration. No toilet rolls in the toilets, not even in the swimming pool toilets, which is asking for trouble. A plastic card to activate minute by minute showers, a card and code to get in and out, pool wristbands, and Lots of deposits and paperwork. Dominated by permanent pitches,which doesn't make for the greatest, most-relaxed atmosphere. There is a bar but we didn't go in it.

Generally quite nice but too chainy,"Very nice, neat, family-friendly, campsite. Decent open air pool for small children. Nice pitches. Clean toilets and showers. However, very basic pub-menu food that is overpriced and small portions. This is because it's a franchise or chain, I guess. You have to queue up, post-office single-file style, order at the bar, from a very basic burger/pizza/etc. menu. Not very French, not at all good value for money. Very dry. No gluten free.

There is a lake with an inflatable, but it is not very good as there are sharp edges. Two of our three kids had cuts from the lake floor or rough inflatable edges.

Not ethical and not fresh,"I use this shop regularly because it is the closest shop to my home in Southville. However, it is extremely expensive and the fruit and veg is of low quality. It may be organic and possibly some of it sourced locally, but so much of it is rarely fresh and quite often I see fruit and veg that is positively off. I noticed that the mejoul dates are from Israel so I'm not sure where their 'ethical' boundaries lie. 'Ethical' is in their header strap line on signage, so I think they should come right out and say whether or not they support the Israeli apartheid regime. You expect from places like Asda a non-caring or not thought out sourcing philosphy but a shop that pronounces ethical sourcing should explain why it advertises Israel in its shop. You can import dates from Palestine or central Africa

"A horrible range of overpriced dishwater beer and not very nice, arrogant staff","Clientele: mixed men and women. The only good thing about it is that it isn't over blokey.
Beer: universally and comprehensively awful. Some of them are truly undrinkable. Overpriced by a long way.
Staff: generally quite rude, arrogant and condescending. If you don't stroke your chin while ordering or tasting from a range of orangey and lemony dishwater concoctions, you will be looked at and spoken to as if they would rather you left.
Location: very good.
Value for money: terrible.
Demographic: White middle class middle-aged bubble.

I have been to this place several times and finally decided to give it the bad review it so deserves. I honestly can't ever believe it is so bad so I occasionally give it another try. Last night I paid 8.70 for a fizzy water and a bottle of supposedly Belgian beer (33cl). I managed half of it before giving up as it was lemony and tasted nothing like any Belgian beer I have ever had. I physically could not finish it as it was so unpleasantn and one of my friends could not drink his 33cl of pale ale draught dishwater.

Avoid this place unless you want to mix with the kind of people mentioned above and sample dishwater in 33cl glasses.

Ok. very good location. Thank you staff at The Carlton for a very friendly welcome and excellent service.,"The price led me here as I wanted a basic cheap overnight stop before boarding Eurotunnel early morning for a same-day return.

Perfect for Eurotunnel as a ten-minute drive to the terminal. Basically, this is a one or two star hotel (no idea how to class it but i would accept their classification of 2, without quibbling). It cost me £10 per night more than an overnight parking ticket at Maidstone services. A WHOLE lot better than sleeping in a van in a motorway services. Excellent location, 3 minutes to all the takeaways and supermarket.

Room very basic, clean sheets and clean towels, warm (with a heater), sea view. Electric shower (no need to say more), pretty grubby generally in the room but you get what you pay for. Decent TV.

The bar is excellent and the lounge also very nice with a gas fire and large TV playing music. He let us bring takeaways to the room which some hotels don't like. The breakfast we took on the second morning was perfectly OK for £7 each, including a decent full English, unlimited toast and all the cereals and condiments and coffee on a buffet table. Can't really argue with that. 24 hour main door security.

To be honest, not sure I would go back unless their restaurant that is being refurbished is an Indian restaurant, which it might be. This was a budget trip to buy stock in Belgium and costs were being kept to the minimum. I went with my 12-year-old daughter who - incidentally - loved it!!! but if I was going again with all the family I would be paying more and staying elsewhere, like the snob I am ;)

similar facilities and feel to Brean Sands/Burnham on Sea,"I'd forgotten how middle class this part of France is. If you want to go on holiday in France and speak English all the time, see no black people nor east Europeans, etc etc., this bubble is perfect.

But I would be visiting them sober and with high expectations. On this visit to the Raj, food was served in large quantities and with 'lowest common denominator' spice and flavour factors. You really would only appreciate it after ten pints and it was extremely Bland.

Not ethical and not fresh,"I use this shop regularly because it is the closest shop to my home in Southville. However, it is extremely expensive and the fruit and veg is of low quality. It may be organic and possibly some of it sourced locally, but so much of it is rarely fresh and quite often I see fruit and veg that is positively off. I noticed that the mejoul dates are from Israel so I'm not sure where their 'ethical' boundaries lie. 'Ethical' is in their header strap line on signage, so I think they should come right out and say whether or not they support the Israeli apartheid regime. You expect from places like Asda a non-caring or not thought out sourcing philosphy but a shop that pronounces ethical sourcing should explain why it advertises Israel in its shop. You can import dates from Palestine or central Africa

Hobbs House bread stockist, so low quality pappy bread available.

"A horrible range of overpriced dishwater beer and not very nice, arrogant staff","Clientele: mixed men and women. The only good thing about it is that it isn't over blokey.
Beer: universally and comprehensively awful. Some of them are truly undrinkable. Overpriced by a long way.
Staff: generally quite rude, arrogant and condescending. If you don't stroke your chin while ordering or tasting from a range of orangey and lemony dishwater concoctions, you will be looked at and spoken to as if they would rather you left.
Location: very good.
Value for money: terrible.
Demographic: White middle class middle-aged bubble.

I have been to this place several times and finally decided to give it the bad review it so deserves. I honestly can't ever believe it is so bad so I occasionally give it another try. Last night I paid 8.70 for a fizzy water and a bottle of supposedly Belgian beer (33cl). I managed half of it before giving up as it was lemony and tasted nothing like any Belgian beer I have ever had. I physically could not finish it as it was so unpleasantn and one of my friends could not drink his 33cl of pale ale draught dishwater.

Avoid this place unless you want to mix with the kind of people mentioned above and sample dishwater in 33cl glasses.

So so easy and I cannot speak any Flemish so I praise the experience very highly as a tourist in need of some quick, easy, wholesome grub. By the way, my steak was lovely and the deserts equally lovely and generous portioned.

Ok. very good location. Thank you staff at The Carlton for a very friendly welcome and excellent service.,"The price led me here as I wanted a basic cheap overnight stop before boarding Eurotunnel early morning for a same-day return.

Perfect for Eurotunnel as a ten-minute drive to the terminal. Basically, this is a one or two star hotel (no idea how to class it but i would accept their classification of 2, without quibbling). It cost me £10 per night more than an overnight parking ticket at Maidstone services. A WHOLE lot better than sleeping in a van in a motorway services. Excellent location, 3 minutes to all the takeaways and supermarket.

Room very basic, clean sheets and clean towels, warm (with a heater), sea view. Electric shower (no need to say more), pretty grubby generally in the room but you get what you pay for. Decent TV.

"Fantastic spot, right on the beach, close to Bora Bora. Friendly and excellent food.","The only criticisms I would have are: 1) I chose to pay extra (quite a bit) for a sea view. Yes, the view of the pool and the beach and sea are excellent. BUT, the rooms seem to attract smoking guests. So, in fact, the smell was unbearable to us (non-smokers). Room 225 we had to move out of because the bedroom is adjacent to a balcony window and the smell was terrible.Room 226 was marginally better but my clothes all smelled of fags when I got home.

2) The music played on the poolside never did anything for me. It actually drove me out one morning as I got taken the wrong way while trying to order breakfast. There was no effort put in to play interesting or just house music in general. In fact, nearly all the time, if on the poolside (a lot, mainly because Bora Bora was closed and JET was full of blokes) you can only hear muffled music half drowned out by louder music on either side.

Other than that....the food is EXCELLENT. Good value, high high quality, fast service, very friendly staff all of them, well stocked bar with lots of options. Very friendly and helpful manager and reception. Clean pool, clean poolside, clean hotel, clean rooms, clean kitchens. Excellent spot on the beach. Happy relaxed punters.

The BEST Indian restaurant in Bristol,"I have no doubt in saying this is the best Indian restaurant in our city (that is - the Indian section of zaza bazaar :) ). The range of food is incredible. North and South Indian, street food and all the old familiar favourites are all there. Plus - freshly made dosa. say no more! I lived in India for two years and have difficulty settling back in to standard Indian restaurants in the UK. But the sheer quality, the broad range, the experienced chefs, and the value for money - all make this the best little Indian corner that cannot be touched by any Indian restaurant in Bristol. Where else in the UK have I seen Pani Puri? a dosa man? etc etc.

Extremely educational for kids. A utopia for international foodies. And I have only spoken about the Indian section so far. My son is gluten free and likes NANDOS.
