Lovely atmosphere,"Lovely atmosphere with the outdoor seating, nice to be back at a restaurant feeling relaxed.

Server kindly seated us 15 mins before our reservation time. Asked if we had the NHS app, took ours names and numbers as we didn’t. Lots of outdoor seating next to the grass square beside the football museum.

Service was good on the whole, found we were waiting a bit longer for drinks orders as it got busier but the servers were up and down so just had to get their attention. Margaritas were nice, tandoori chicken tikka starter was very tender and tasty.",April 2021,Delhi House Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d21228545-Reviews-Delhi_House_Cafe-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,5.0

"Outstanding service, gorgeous hot choc","The standout experience from my recent visit was the service. From the minute I stepped in, the staff were so welcoming and friendly, throughout to advising on what to order and asking how everything was. They were so warm and friendly, and that genuine warmth goes such a long way. Should probably talk about the hot choc.. The salted caramel hot choc was gorgeous! Rich but so enjoyable, it was gone before I knew it.",February 2020,Cocoa Wonderland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186364-d3172574-Reviews-Cocoa_Wonderland-Sheffield_South_Yorkshire_England.html,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Beautiful building, limited information displays","Really beautiful monastery building at the top of the hill but unfortunately very little by way of information displays. Real shame as understanding the history of a place really enhances the experience.

Avoid the toilets- 10 for squatting hole in the ground loos..",January 2020,St Michael's Golden Domed Monastery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294474-d1946577-Reviews-St_Michael_s_Golden_Domed_Monastery-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",attractions,3.0,4.5
Chocolate heaven,"Outstanding chocolate themed cafe! When I saw chocolate themed, it is absolute chocolate heaven: melted cups of chocolate, flavoured coffees and chocolate espresso, plates of truffles, chocolate cakes.. Very cheap!

Lovely décor as murals adorn the walls. Service is the best we received in Kiev (low bar!) as waitresses were polite and spoke great English. Could be a little slow as it gets very busy.

Bit of advice- don’t get too carried away given the prices and choice, it’s rich so you soon get full!

Also well located in Old Kiev. If you walk down from St Anthony’s Church, there are lots of stalls on either side of the street (watch the prices!).",January 2020,Lviv Handmade Chocolate Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294474-d4468113-Reviews-Lviv_Handmade_Chocolate_Cafe-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Main street in central Kiev,"Great reference point for when you’re out and about as it’s the main street right in the city centre, so handy for navigating. Independence Square is on this street as well as big shop chains (Nike, Zara etc), and leads onto more shopping streets. Strongly recommend visiting Gulliver shopping centre, which is 10 mins from this street.

Lots of underpasses along this big main road- handy for crossing but can be a bit disorientating in the larger ones, which also host shops and small malls.",December 2019,Khreshchatyk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294474-d1066189-Reviews-Khreshchatyk-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",attractions,3.0,4.5
Stunning architecture,"Must see attraction in the centre of Kiev either as a sight in itself (budget friendly!), or to walk around the inner exhibits and to climb the bell tower. We visited during the Christmas period so the route from St Michael’s to St Sophia’s was lined with Christmas markets. St Sophia square is also the location of one of the New Year celebrations: absolutely rammed, limited to countdown and no fireworks so would not recommend for NY.",January 2020,Saint Sophia Cathedral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294474-d556660-Reviews-Saint_Sophia_Cathedral-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Beautiful, recently developed","Beautiful site, the only one we went to with English explanations of historical background so very thankful for that! Looks to have been recently developed for tourists with signs and pathways (again, one of the few sites to be catered to tourists). We visited at night so it was lovely and quiet, nicely lit up.

There is some construction work around the site along with abandoned buildings to its side. Doesn’t affect the experience if you enter through the main entrance but when coming down from the cross monument on the hill, offers an interesting parallel between neglect and development (see pic).",December 2019,The Holy Dormition Kyiv Caves Lavra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294474-d579203-Reviews-The_Holy_Dormition_Kyiv_Caves_Lavra-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",attractions,3.0,4.5
Nice viewpoint over the river,"Unfortunately the arch is no longer coloured as pictured in the headline picture but is an impressive large structure, with statues at its foot. There is a great viewpoint over the river and a pedestrian footbridge across to the street of St Michael’s cathedral.

The area hosts market stalls at Christmas time and a music stage for New Year celebrations (great fun with people of all ages dancing to Queen, UK 60s pop, Latin and Desi!).",December 2019,People’s Friendship Arch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294474-d3187920-Reviews-People_s_Friendship_Arch-Kyiv_Kiev.html,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",attractions,4.0,4.0

Great variety and value for money!,"Wonderful museum in the heart of the University District! 5€ for adults over 26, 3€ for adults under 26. Great variety of displays spanning natural history, art, anatomy, military and map history. Personal highlight was the obstetrics room- odd on the face of it but absolutely fascinating about how midwifery was developed! Wax models showing layered breakdown of muscles also amazing.

Thoroughly disappointing,"Overall= please please only consider as a last resort! We only stayed as closer to downtown than the big chains but ended up getting taxis anyway.

Pros:
- Located within 2 mins of Abdali Mall and The Boulevard.
- Nice décor.

Cons:
- Felt extremely unwelcome as totally disregarded by staff. No information at check in, not even acknowledgment when you entered the building.
- Large groups of young boys hang around the area at night so very intimidating and noisy.
- Clientele appears to be limited (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar) so would not recommend to Western tourists.
- Very poor housekeeping- really minimal when done, sheets were not changed for duration of stay.",August 2019,DownTown Hotel Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293986-d15617348-Reviews-DownTown_Hotel_Apartments-Amman_Amman_Governorate.html,"Amman, Jordan",hotels,2.0,3.0
Local gem,"Great local restaurant with a wide selection of traditional dishes. Service is quick as it’s so busy. My Shish Taouk was nice and reasonably price at 4JD, however my partner’s dish did not come as described and seemed to have been substituted for a completely different meat (think camel).

I was a little apprehensive entering as we were the only tourists there but no-one pays you ant notice so don’t be put off!

Beautiful structure,"Definitely definitely recommend visiting this as it’s beautiful and is set nicely against the background of the bustling city. Free with the Jordan Pass (simply scanned from your phone or printout at the small ticket booth, then shown again at the entrance) or 2JD without.

Also very close to the downtown area so useful landmark for taxis!",August 2019,Roman Amphitheater,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293986-d319450-Reviews-Roman_Amphitheater-Amman_Amman_Governorate.html,"Amman, Jordan",attractions,5.0,4.5
Truly a Wonder of the World,"This really is the most breathtaking place. Not only steeped in history, but naturally stunning and quite beyond belief when you first arrive.

Tips:
- Water- take a bottle that keeps water cold then top it up with at least one other big bottle of water.
- Snacks- it’s huge and can be hard going so take high-energy snacks, hydration gels or Dextro Energy tablets to keep you going.
- Unwanted attention- be mindful that men may follow you about and attempt to include you in pictures. Mitigated by the presence of park rangers and keeping your wits about you, not a major drama.
- Spread it over two days- that way you can really absorb it. We did the Treasury, the High Place of Worship, the Temple and the Monastery on the first day. Then the Royal Tombs and Byzantine Church on the second.
- Plan which trails you want to do- the Monastery hike is particularly hard going as it’s steep and long. The structure itself is visually similar to the Treasury so would avoid if we were to do it again. Good shopping along the way though!
- Visitor Centre map- excellent for indicating the different trails.
- Stop for coffee by the Royal Tombs- really lovely Bedouin bloke called Ahmed owns a big stall. Stop by, so welcoming!",August 2019,Petra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g318895-d319461-Reviews-Petra-Petra_Wadi_Musa_Ma_an_Governorate.html,"Petra - Wadi Musa, Jordan",attractions,5.0,5.0
"On Petra’s doorstep, but very poor service","Overall= did the job for a 2 night stay to see Petra.

Pros:
- Location- less than 200m to Petra, 15 mins walk from small town centre. Also several little supermarkets within 5 mins.
- Cheap considering location!
- Lovely view from front facing rooms (pic attached).
- Free mini bar including water.

Cons:
- Staff- appalling service from Duty Manager who agreed late check out then proceeded to remove our belongings and leave them in reception while we were out. Then denied all acknowledge and was incredibly disrespectful. Staff overall seem miserable and unaccommodating, with a few exceptions.
- Dated décor- very old-fashioned.",August 2019,Petra Moon Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g318895-d799277-Reviews-Petra_Moon_Hotel-Petra_Wadi_Musa_Ma_an_Governorate.html,"Petra - Wadi Musa, Jordan",hotels,3.0,4.5

Highly disappointing,"Positives:
- Muhamarah- nice taste but entirely different texture (like couscous, rather than a dip) to standard recipe
- Lemon and mint juice tasty but expensive at £3.99

Points to note:
- Kabsah- huge pile of tasteless rice accompanied by a similarly tasteless, unseasoned small piece of boiled lamb (chicken likewise)
- Spicy potatoes bland and appeared to have simply been warmed up, squidgy texture
- Extremely quiet for a Saturday evening
- No buffet available, to our disappointment",September 2018,Beirut Lebanese Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d1855721-Reviews-Beirut_Lebanese_Restaurant-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5

- Beautiful interior décor
- Spicy fried chicken was excellent, lovely sauce
- Cocktails were great (Korean Colada and Pomegranate Pornstar Martini)

Points to note:

- Spicy seafood udon noodle dish was nice but lacked decent quantity of seafood
- Rice portion ordered as side was small
