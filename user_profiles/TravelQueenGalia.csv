Low-cost Indeed,"The company does make effort to make the flight process as swift as possible, however it would be nice if there were more employees scattered around the check in station and the gate for questions and further information, since most operations are now automated (like check in and baggage drop). It was said that the gate will close at 7:40 and we only began boarding on 7:50. When we landed, the bus to carry us back to the airport took twenty minutes and when it arrived it did contain all passangers and we waited for an additional bus. Also the flight attendents just run accross the aisle, stepping on my leg on their way.",December 2019,easyJet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729066-Reviews-EasyJet,World,flights,3.0,3.5
Anyone can enjoy,"This museam combines fun and engaging activities that children can enjoy, along with interesting pieces of information related to the German history of espionage. Covers anything spy related - from a short history of cipher, to double agents, german spies, and intelligence organizations and fake news.

Functional and Nothing Else,"Attractive location, clean rooms and nice view. Breakfast was good but slightly crowded. The bathtub and sink are not seperated from the bedroom (only by a thin curtain that did not cover the section entirely), which was not mentioned in the site - room is very small. However, this hotel gets the job done.",December 2019,Park Inn by Radisson Berlin Alexanderplatz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187323-d230550-Reviews-Park_Inn_by_Radisson_Berlin_Alexanderplatz-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",hotels,2.0,3.5
Fresh Ingredients and Delicious Food,"Service was very warm and friendly, food tasted fresh and homemade - necessary break from all of the tourist-y, overpriced restorount posing as authentic. The food was delicious, especially the green balls and the taramasalata.

Delicous,"Atmosphere is very pleasnet, wine was delicious. The waitor was very friendly. We ordered the salad which was nice and fresh, the zukini balls were refreshing and comforting.

Not very good,"We thought this is a nice place of small, authentic dishes. The atmosphere is very nice and the service is friendly. However, the food is not good. The ""mommy handmade vine leaves"" had an industrial taste and we suspect that they came from a can. They were also too salty. The fried cheese was nice, The sausage was okay, the salad was excellent and the fava was refrigerated for some reason and we didn't wat much of it. We are also Mediterranean and we know how this food tastes when it is properly made. Could be nice if you are unfamiliar with the cuisine. They didn't charge us for the vine leaves, which was nice.",October 2019,Ta Karamanlidika tou Fani,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6852056-Reviews-Ta_Karamanlidika_tou_Fani-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
"Breathtaking building, poorly treated","Considered by many a must see in Athens, the acropolis is breathtaking, however the setting causes the experience to not be as powerful as it could. The site is often extremely crowded, with a massive line in front of the entrance and the exit. You are not allowed in the building itself and can only view it from the outside, which is disappointing. The building is under construction, which spoils the effect of the place. We do not regret seeing it, it just was not as good as it could be.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5

Just get coffee,"Coffee of excellent quality, food is mediocre at best. We first ordered a lentil salad, which was rather unappatizing. However they opted the salad for a greek salad, which was ok.
