Great experience for sports fans,This is a great place for those who love the olympics and sport generally and a nice change after viewing ancient ruins. Take the free audio tour and climb to the top of the grandstand for great views of the acropolis.,October 2019,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Hike with Amazing Views,A short a steep hike is well rewarded by an amazing view across Athens as well as a cute church and a couple of restaurants. Regardless of the weather it can be very chilly once you reach the top so worth carrying a sweater. For those who might struggle with the hike it is still worth the trip with the cable car but it can be hard to find with a few people following the hiking trail thinking they will meet the cable car.,October 2019,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great experience but some warning,An amazing experience and a must see in Athens. The one “but” is to try to avoid the crowds and heat (even in October) by going early in the morning or late afternoon. There is also a ticket for about 6 of the ancient ruin sites in Athens and is €10 more which is good value if you plan to see a few. But check they are included.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
