Nice surrounds but basic mistakes by staff,"Went here for lunch with my wife and mum for her birthday. The staff were very pleasant and helpful but several things let them down. They offered coconut milk when they didn’t have any, they forgot the side order and put bacon on one dish when it was asked to be swapped. Possibly could have been avoided if the waitress had used a pad instead of her memory.",September 2020,LB & CO Espresso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255118-d7310590-Reviews-LB_CO_Espresso-Christchurch_Canterbury_Region_South_Island.html,"Christchurch, New Zealand",restaurants,3.0,3.5
"Food and service food, liquors and spirits not so.",Had a large group booking and everyone enjoyed the food but the bar service was not so.

Vegan takeaway,Seen some very precious reviews and for a place trying to do some good it’s disappointing. Hopefully there will be more reviews posted to give a balanced view. It is what it is. When you make Aioli with vegan ingredients it won’t taste exactly the same as egg based. Take it for what it is. We enjoyed it and if you open your mind you will too.

Very cool,Issac was excellent as a host. Very interesting displays and background information. Questions answered quickly and expertly and very friendly. Was very patient with the smaller girls questions. Great thing to do on a wet day and with family.,August 2019,Weta Workshop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255115-d1197086-Reviews-Weta_Workshop-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Island.html,"Wellington, New Zealand",attractions,5.0,4.5
Have ordered from here several times,Have ordered here several times and had no problem with the service or drinks. Stick standard food that you can get from other chains. Tasty enough to encourage me to keep going back when I’m in the area.,July 2019,Tank Juice Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255106-d9609723-Reviews-Tank_Juice_Bar-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",restaurants,3.0,4.0
