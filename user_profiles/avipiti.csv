Very good restaurant with beautiful views,The restaurant is located at the top of the trail from the beach. It was nice to receive a warm welcome after the long climb. The food and service were excellent. The views of the caldera are beautiful.,October 2019,Panorama Resto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1782920-d1861275-Reviews-Panorama_Resto-Thirassia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent restaurant with great views,The food and service were excellent. The views from the restaurant are beautiful. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the building.,October 2019,Pelekanos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d1212265-Reviews-Pelekanos-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent hotel with amazing views,"We stayed in two Volcano Sea View Studios with outdoor Jacuzzi rooms. The views of the caldera were absolutely stunning. In my opinion the sunset views from the hotel beat any other location (there are no crowds!). The rooms were large, and the outdoor Jacuzzi was a lot of fun. The pool (overlooking the Caldera) was surprisingly deep. Breakfast was very good. The service at the hotel was exceptional. They did their best to provide all our requests. For example, my daughter had a birthday, and they prepared a cake at no extra charge. Note that there aren't many parking places (like everywhere else on Santorini...). Highly recommended!",October 2019,Xenones Filotera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d278898-Reviews-Xenones_Filotera-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Beautiful beach in Sidari,"The beach is right next to the Canal D'amour. It's surrounded by high cliffs, which provide a secluded feeling.",October 2019,Paralía Sidári,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g676295-d1156914-Reviews-Paralia_Sidari-Sidari_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Beautiful canal,The canal and its surroundings are a great place for beautiful pictures.

Great restaurant with beautiful views,The restaurant is located a few minutes walk from the Canal D'amour. The views from the restaurant are beautiful. The food and service were excellent. Note that the navigation apps seem to be unable to find the exact location - park next to the Kanali Apartments,October 2019,Aquarius,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g676295-d1911120-Reviews-Aquarius-Sidari_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Very pretty beach,"The beach consists of two separated parts - the left part for swimming and non-motor boats, and the right part for speed-boat rentals. Parking is next to the beach. Sunsets from the beach are beautiful.",October 2019,Ampelaki Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g776017-d10414145-Reviews-Ampelaki_Beach-Paleokastritsa_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great boat rental,"The rental dock is located on the right-side bay of Ampelaki beach. They were very nice and professional. After a short explanation we were on our way. Note that the allowed sailing area is not that big. Engine-on time is around 3.5 hours, so be careful not to run out of fuel. They provide a map, but when you move further away from the beach, the coastline looks the same... We needed Google maps to get back to the dock... One con - the boat didn't have an electronic map and depth meter (which exists in some rental boats). Without this (and without knowledge of the area), you must keep far away from the shores",October 2019,Ampelaki Boats,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g776017-d7734294-Reviews-Ampelaki_Boats-Paleokastritsa_Corfu_Ionian_Islands.html,"Corfu, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent restaurant with beautiful views,"The restaurant is located inside Kalabaka. You can park right next to the restaurant (on top of a small hill), or in a dirt parking lot right near by. Food and service were very good, and the views of the cliffs above are very impressive.",October 2019,Meteoron Panorama,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315843-d1216350-Reviews-Meteoron_Panorama-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing views,"The sunset views from ""Sunset rock"" are spectacular. Get there at least 30 minutes before sunset if you want a good spot. Some of the rocks can be dangerous, so watch your steps. To reach ""Sunset rock"", turn right before Kalabaka, pass the ""Meteora Observation Deck"" (also very pretty, but also very crowded), and after a few minutes you'll reach a small observation point (many refer to it as ""Sunset rock""). Very few parking spaces, so just park like everyone else...",October 2019,Meteora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1070999-d523805-Reviews-Meteora-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Impressive monastery,"Despite the fact that this was the site of the ""For your eyes only"" James Bond movie climax, there is no 007 memorabilia. From the small parking lot you need to first walk down, and then climb up many stairs. For anyone reasonably fit this isn't a major effort (probably equivalent to climbing a seven-story building). The views from the top are very pretty. The Monastery is very small, but there are no crowds.",October 2019,Holy Trinity Monastery (Agia Triada),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315843-d243294-Reviews-Holy_Trinity_Monastery_Agia_Triada-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great rafting on the Arachthos river,"Although there wasn't a lot of water in the river, the rafting trip was really great. Our guide, Sebastian, was very nice, professional, and informative. We were picked-up (on time!) from the Restaupark Papadopoulos cafe, and driven by van (~30 minutes) to the starting point (need to change into a wet suit in the van - if this is a problem then it's probably best to change at the restaurant). The rafting itself is around 2-2.5 hours. As long as the guide's instructions are followed, the trip is very safe (at least in mid-October water levels). The trip ends at the Plaka brdige, where there are dressing rooms. The drive back to the restaurant is ~45 minutes. Highly recommended!",October 2019,Active Nature,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189453-d4892216-Reviews-Active_Nature-Ioannina_Ioannina_Region_Epirus.html,"Ioannina, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Beautiful ancient city,"Located 2.5 hours from Athens, the Delphi ruins are both very pretty and impressive. The ruins are located next to the modern city, which offers plenty of restaurants.

Excellent restaurant in Delphi,"The food and service were excellent, and at a low price. The restaurant is located around a 5-10 minute drive from the Delphi ancient ruins.

Beautiful relic of ancient Greece,"This is ancient Greece at its best. It costs 20 Euro for adults (over 18) to visit (bring you teens passports or ID to prove they are under 18).

Restaurant with great views,The restaurant is located on the roof of the Thissio hotel. Both the food and service were excellent. It would have been nice if smoking wasn't allowed...

Amazing views of the Acropolis,"We stayed in the family room (#201), which consists of two rooms and a bathroom. The views of the Acropolis are amazing. The hotel is located around a ten minutes walk from the Acropolis and the Plaka district. Service was excellent. Not much choice for breakfast, but the food was very good. The cons - the bathroom (shower-only) is very small. The room is located on the second floor (the elevator doesn't stop at this room, and it can only be accessed by stairs, although the staff helped with the luggage). The room overlooks a small street where the garbage cans are located, and the garbage trucks made a lot of noise early in the morning.",October 2019,Hotel Thissio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d614089-Reviews-Hotel_Thissio-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,3.5
THIS IS SPARTA!!!,"It's a shame that the Greeks don't honor one of their greatest leaders in a more appropriate manner. The signs to the monument are really bad, and the navigation apps don't do a very good job either. All over Greece exposed electrical wires are a photographer's nightmare, but here the wires really ruin the view of the monument. The monument itself is quite impressive, but the important thing is visiting one of the most important battlegrounds in European & western history, and appreciating the sacrifice of those who helped stop the Persian invasion",October 2019,Leonidas Monument,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189412-d282022-Reviews-Leonidas_Monument-Thermopylae_Phthiotis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Thermopylae, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great hotel in the old city of jaffa,"The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from the beach. The room was nice, and the bathroom had a bath. The hotel only has three floors, so no escape from the street noise (the windows are not well insulated). Breakfast was very good, and part of the floor is made of glass to show the original old building. Service was excellent. The hotel has an arrangement (30 NIS per day) with a near-by garage - finding parking in the old city can be problematic.",October 2019,Market House Tel Aviv Jaffa - An Atlas Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293984-d7134417-Reviews-Market_House_Tel_Aviv_Jaffa_An_Atlas_Boutique_Hotel-Tel_Aviv_Tel_Aviv_District.html,"Tel Aviv, Israel",hotels,5.0,5.0
