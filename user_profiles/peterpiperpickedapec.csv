Top notch meal,A superb meal and very reasonably priced. Everything’s is just a little too much of a pain in this nonsensical Covid world which is a pity. Still we enjoyed our meal and the staff were excellent. Highly recommended,August 2020,The Ship Hotel Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2026206-d2266854-Reviews-The_Ship_Hotel_Restaurant-Brancaster_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Brancaster, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Another stunning beach,"Another great beach to either relax on when the sunshine’s or walk when it doesn’t. Vast areas of open sand so plenty of space (if you can be bothered to walk more than 100m from the car park which it seems most people can’t) Toilets were clean and tidy. We stayed in Brancaster so walked to the beach, about a mile or so. The sad thing is the road and verges were littered with discarded face masks, nappies and other human detritus. There really are some dreadful people in this beautiful world.",August 2020,Brancaster Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2026206-d3491961-Reviews-Brancaster_Bay-Brancaster_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Brancaster, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fantastic,"What a lovely set up they have here. Always a sucker for steam trains and this was one of the most memorable. Sadly not able to run the full distance to Walsingham because of the coronavirus nonsense but the 30 min round trip on offer was a delight and not a face mask in sight. In fact a completely normal experience. The staff were superb, friendly, relaxed and great with the little ones. £5 to park with half refunded if you use the train, plenty of space to picnic and only a 29 min walk into Wells which at the moment I would avoid. People need to make the effort to support attractions like this.",August 2020,The Wells & Walsingham Light Railway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315941-d7116553-Reviews-The_Wells_Walsingham_Light_Railway-Wells_next_the_Sea_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Wells-next-the-Sea, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Glorious,"This place has the lot. History, location, character, service and ambience. In bucket loads. By far the best hotel I have stayed in. Yes there are more modern offerings but you can keep them we stayed in the Dungar wing, occupied in the past by George V, Lord Mountbatten, Lord Elgin and pretty much anyone who was anyone during the raj. You don’t get that in a premier inn. Oh and the food and service was pretty good too!

Beautiful setting,Hard to find a better view anywhere I would suggest. The hotel is part of the huge city palace and museum the whole site is stunning. The food in the hotel is superb and reasonably priced. Drinks however are not and that why it lost a star.

"Excellent food, great staff and super value","Very good restaurant a little out of the way but well worth the trip. Watch the portion sizes, they are big!

Excellent,"I can’t quite understand why this museum only has 4 reviews. A fabulous building set in beautiful grounds the museum houses a very interesting collection. Not to great to overwhelm but more than enough to interest. It’s well laid out with good signage. Originally build to commemorate the visit of the Price of Wales, later George V, in 1905. A rather splendid statue of him stands serenely in front of the building that one bore his title. Latterly it’s been renamed, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya museum. I guess this is part of a history cleansing exercise. Rather ironic for a museum.",February 2020,Archaeological Survey of India Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304554-d321436-Reviews-Archaeological_Survey_of_India_Museum-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fascinating,Apparently 4 million people pass through here every day and most were there when we visited. It’s a beautiful building very reminiscent of St Pancras in London. The architecture is wonderful and some of the details fascinating.

Disappointing,Clearly an impressive structure of great historical interest and with its own story. Unfortunately the area around it was littered with fencing making a good sight and decent photographs impossible.

Fabulous but a little inpersonal,"Why only four stars? I have no major complaints the staff were excellent, facilities first class, location excellent and a breakfast to die for.

Great ambiance and very good.,A really nice restaurant with some good service and great dishes. I can recommend the chicken Rara nice and spicy. Portions are good and you get plenty to eat. Good value at around £20 per head. Table water might be a nice touch.

Perfect,"We had a fantastic stay at the Stern am Rathaus. The hotel is very well located easy walking to the station and all the main sights. In fact they are literally on your doorstep. The old town and cathedral Christmas markets are 2 minutes away. The room was clean, comfortable and very well presented. Breakfast was spot on a brilliant range of foods. I can recommend the over night oats, the meats and cheese, stuffed chillies, cherry bake, chocolate mouse and vanilla cream. Actually I can recommend all of it. A well stocked fridge with drinks is available in the entrance it’s a help yourself arrangement with an honesty book. Prices are very reasonable and that includes the room rate. Why are British hotels unable to do this?",December 2019,Stern am Rathaus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187371-d1548642-Reviews-Stern_am_Rathaus-Cologne_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html,"Cologne, Germany",hotels,5.0,5.0
Superb,A fantastic gallery and well worth an hour or two of your time. Kathe Kollwitz was one seriously talented artist. Her work is very thought provoking. At the time we visited the equally Impressive ‘Berlin Realism’ exhibition was on. All in all brilliant value for €5. Definitely not one to be missed.,December 2019,Käthe Kollwitz Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187371-d3885562-Reviews-Kathe_Kollwitz_Museum-Cologne_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html,"Cologne, Germany",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent gallery,A very good collection of art from the 13th -20th century laid out on 3 floors. The Rembrandt exhibition was on when we visited which was well laid out and had some fine pictures. Rembrandt is not my favourite but his students could certainly knock out the odd picture! A bit on the pricey side at €13 better value with the Köln card.,December 2019,Wallraf-Richartz Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187371-d192300-Reviews-Wallraf_Richartz_Museum-Cologne_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html,"Cologne, Germany",attractions,4.0,4.5

Neat bar with a great range,"Neat bar with a great range of beers, 29 on tap from around the world plus bottles. Staff are really friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is great, good music at nice volumes, old School video games oh and did I mention the beer?

Great value,A four night stay €250 is hard to beat. The hotel had everything you need and nothing else but that’s no bad thing. The staff were super friendly and willing to help. Everything was clean and well set up. Breakfast was basic but again all you needed. Great views of Athens and the acropolis from the roof terrace and some excellent bars and restaurants within a 10 min walk.

Underrated,Personally I think this is one of the most interesting and best laid out sights in Athens. It is also fairly quiet and off the main tourist routes. The museum is also very good for a small sight. Nice to see statues in their original positions even if they are casts ( the originals are safely tucked away in the museum).,October 2019,Kerameikos Cemetery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242832-Reviews-Kerameikos_Cemetery-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Superb museum,Definitely not to be missed. The collection of Mycenaean and Cycladic artefacts and superb. The only down side is that to many statues are lost against magnolia walls.

Best viewed from afar,I find the acropolis both overwhelms and underwhelms. It’s hard to be critical of such an important historic sight but close up it always disappoints. My first visit was in 1983 and I was underwhelmed and last in 2019 and I was again underwhelmed although overwhelmed by cruise ship day trippers. Viewed from afar and it’s a different story. From Philopappou Hill the view is amazing the scale of the acropolis and the skills involved building it come into context. The scaffolding is also less visible and the day trippers no more than ants.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
The absolute best,What an absolutely wonderful place to stay and such amazing hosts. Giles and Michael made us feel welcome from the moment we booked to the moment we left. I think it’s fair to say I have never experienced a stay quite like this. Everything is considered and the details wonderful. Apple crumble for breakfast totally amazing.

Super place for all the family,Went here with the family and had a fantastic day out. The castle has some great exhibits and we loved the old amusements and saucy postcards. Memories of my own childhood. The gardens are rather magical and the rides are not hair raising but all great fun. Started to get a bit busy in the afternoon but we were on our way by then fully satisfied.

Beautiful and quiet beack,"A stunning beach, very quiet and with some fantastic rock pools for the little ones. Free parking in the NT car park and enough space for a sand free picnic.

Personal,"My Uncle of whom I have many happy memories as a child, saw action here with the Suffolk Regiment. He was a professional soldier and saw action throughout the war. Part of the BEF at the outbreak of war he was evacuated from Dunkirk returning to France here in Normandy. He was injured by shrapnel in the hand during the campaign somewhere in Normandy but not sure when and where. He didn’t speak much about his time during the war. None of my family did. My father serviced in the Fleet air arm and my other uncle, another professional soldier, with the Suffolk Régiment in India and Burma. It is moving to visit the places they saw when young and just remember all the good times we had together.",July 2019,Hillman Site,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g4059514-d4482189-Reviews-Hillman_Site-Colleville_Montgomery_Calvados_Basse_Normandie_Normandy.html,"Colleville-Montgomery, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very moving,Museum or memorial either way this is a moving experience. Stories and personal items from the soldiers that fought and in many cases died on this spot. Human experiences that really bring the whole thing to life. We arrived expecting to stay only a short time but 2hrs later where still there. If you only do one thing related to the landings then this is it.,July 2019,Pegasus Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1956975-d296190-Reviews-Pegasus_Memorial-Ranville_Calvados_Basse_Normandie_Normandy.html,"Ranville, France",attractions,5.0,5.0
Tourist fayre,"Stopped because we fancied Pizza and they had a table on the pavement. It’s not the best outside dinning experience I’ve ever had? Service was good and the food was also good.

A great starting point,"The €15 pass for the 3 Bayeux museums represents excellent value for money. This is one of the 3 and is definitely one of the better WW2 museums in the area.

Amazing,"The story behind the tapestry is something I grew up with from school. I have read a number of books the best being ‘the Bayeaux tapestry and the Norman invasion’. What books and pictures don’t do is prepare you for the tapestry itself. The colours and quality of an art work nearly 1000 years old is staggering. The story, well one version of it, is told very well through the essential audio guide. A short visit but an absolute must visit. Fantastic.",July 2019,Musee de la Tapisserie de Bayeux,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187181-d230739-Reviews-Musee_de_la_Tapisserie_de_Bayeux-Bayeux_Calvados_Basse_Normandie_Normandy.html,"Bayeux, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful but also disappointing,"Having studied the Plantagenets this visit was a long time wish. The tombs are beautiful and even though there are no remains they still have a reverence particularly for someone who studies or has an interest in history. Sadly there was little information about the tombs or their occupants. Isabella wasn’t even mentioned. For some of the greatest figures in English, and French, history a little sad. The rest of the site is a mixture of bleached renovation and one or two stunning rooms. Sadly the Romanesque kitchens were under cover what little we could see looked very impressive. Still a beautiful building and Absolutely glad I visited but also a tinge of disappointment.",July 2019,L’Abbaye Royale de Fontevraud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187193-d4839889-Reviews-L_Abbaye_Royale_de_Fontevraud-Fontevraud_l_Abbaye_Maine_et_Loire_Pays_de_la_Loire.html,"Fontevraud-l'Abbaye, France",attractions,4.0,4.5
Worst hotel experience in my life an utter disgrace,"I give it 1 star as I have no option to give it none. The people who run this place should be ashamed and have no business being in the hospitality trade. We booked accommodation for 2 nights on the 7th and 8th July 2019. We booked the room on the 3rd September 2018. On the morning of our stay we received notification that the hotel could not accommodate us because they had double booked. It had taken 10 months for them to realise their error. We had missed a telephone call the previous day from booking.com trying to inform us of the same. We were attending a wedding so mobiles were out of action. Alternative accommodation had been found 5km away in the middle of nowhere. This was not suitable. As we were in the area we drove to La Maison Bleau. We were greeted by a woman who I assume was the owner, although gave no formal introduction. She informed us that ‘we’ had a problem! I informed her that it was the hotel that had the problem and that we had booked this room 10 months ago. I did this in the belief that bookings after ours should be the ones cancelled. We were then told that every room in the hotel had been booked before we booked ours, really? I found that hard to believe it also doesn’t explain why it took them 10 months to realise. She then told us that the people in the room we had booked were booked in for 5 days and were already there and so couldn’t be moved, ah! This was no clerical error this was a case of being gazzumped by a better offer. If that wasn’t bad enough the owner seemed completely disinterested in our plight. I’m sure it will be mentioned in the response so I may as well acknowledge it now. She did offer to phone another BnB in the town but they had no room and then another hotel which did. Given the lateness of the notification we had little choice but to go with what was on offer. She also offered for us to have breakfast at La Maison Bleau and the use their pool. She may well have thought this was generous. The idea I would set foot in their ‘hotel’ was very misguided. Especially after the man moping the floor made a condescending remark about my obvious anger, in French. Note to janitor make sure you are not understood when insulting an angry person. You might not like the new storage area for your mop. At no point was an apology offered. The arrogance and disinterest was palpable. We cancel your booking, pass all the responsibility back to booking.com and you’ll be fine whoever we put you. Spineless milquetoast. You may well experience a nice stay in this hotel but be mindful if someone else comes along with a better offer after you’ve booked you’ll be standing on the doorstep with your cases looking like little orphan annie. I have never experienced such treatment by a hotel in my life and I stay in a lot of hotels around the world. Shocking, and yes even 48hrs later I’m seething. You’ve lost a potential booking by us in December, 2 rooms for my daughter in September, and at least one other next year by friends we were traveling with. Look forward to your response Mme La Maison Bleau. So angry.",July 2019,La Maison Bleue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g735266-d9737311-Reviews-La_Maison_Bleue-Villereal_Lot_et_Garonne_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Villereal, France",hotels,1.0,5.0
Don’t pass it by,We seen the abbey on the hill and have driven past on a dozen occasions. We had no idea it was a UNESCO site as it’s not well advertised. This time we stopped for an inquisitive look. The Abbey is surrounded by a very pretty village. Outside it is rather austere and ordinary looking. Inside it is stunning. Unrestored Frescoes adorn the walls and the hand painted detailing on the felling superb. All in all a very nice albeit short stop.

Super lunch stop,Campagne is a delightful village dominated by the chateaux and grounds. I would suggest a nice walk through the grounds before stopping in this very pleasant restaurant.

Incredibly Moving,"Oradour is such a moving place. On the one hand it is understated, beautiful, quiet and serene. At first glance there is nothing to inform you of the horror of what happened. It gradually unfolds as you see the little plaques on the buildings, Dentist, Boulangerie, Patisserie, Ecole de Fills. Then the names of the people, sometimes one, sometimes two, sometimes whole families. The normality of it all is what hits you. Just a normal French village, with normal people going about their normal lives in quiet peaceful isolation.
