A sight to behold and incredibly huge,This is a fantastic Basilica and worth the long wait either in the sun or a queue directly from Vatican City. There is no charge but security is tight and consequently allow plenty of time. It is not open on Sundays and can be closed for services at short notice.,September 2019,St. Peter's Basilica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187793-d631111-Reviews-St_Peter_s_Basilica-Vatican_City_Lazio.html,"Vatican City, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
What an amazing site to behold.,"Together with my wife we both individually agreed this was a highlight of both our Italy and Greece holiday. Fortuitously the guide left us due to a special service in St Peter's basilica. Consequently, we spent over 2 hours gazing at the ceiling, the walls which represented the old and new Testaments, and being able to get ""3D imaging"" just by virtue of taking your time, which jumped out at you such as Mary and Christ. What an amazing piece of work by Michelangelo and according to the guide he did that sitting with his neck in extension. A MUST SEE. Try to break away from a tour group so you have the unrushed opportunity (a group time appeared to be only 15 to 20 minutes)",September 2019,Sistine Chapel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187793-d190130-Reviews-Sistine_Chapel-Vatican_City_Lazio.html,"Vatican City, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
An unforgettable stroll down history and religion,"This is truly a remarkable place behind closed doors and worth every Euro of your admission involving long large corridors with sculptures, historical items and wall and ceiling painting.",September 2019,Vatican City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187793-d1968471-Reviews-Vatican_City-Vatican_City_Lazio.html,"Vatican City, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
A great site to visit for historians,"It was great to see the old stone paved roads, chiselled with chariot wheels, and the remains of ""houses"". Allow 3-4 hours, and you can get around to visit the important items which are the Forum, Cave canem sign, Vista del misteri, House of Faun, Amphitheatre, Necropili di Nocera, Necropili di Stabia. PS: can then go on to Mount Vesuvius to do on the same day.

What an absolutely stunning sight with a back drop of blue sky,"This is another one of Italy's must see venues, and do take the time and effort to climb up to the top to soak up the atmosphere but also to enjoy the exercise and views at the top.

"WOW, you need to see it with your own eyes!",This was truly the most spectacular and memorable occasion of our Italy holiday. We spent a couple of hours soaking up the atmosphere and admiring Michelangelo's David. Many many pictures later I still wanted to stay beyond my wife's desire to leave.

What wonderful history and architectural presence,"This is a must see in Athens, and you will need around 3 hours to take the somewhat difficult walk up, with a bird's eye view over the entire city, the Acropolis Museum and Philipappou Hill. Make sure you go to Philipappou Hill, to observe Acropolis at night and wonderful sunset",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

What an awesome atmosphere to soak in,"This was a memorable experience involving a walk around the entire stadium around the top, and then experiencing a walk around the track, photos on the podium, and most importantly the athlete tunnel leading to the museum which had Olympic torches and posters from each and every Olympic. How wonderful! Well worth the few euros, don't walk away just with pictures from the outside.",September 2019,Olympia Theater,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d607262-Reviews-Olympia_Theater-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Wonderful collection of historical Acropolis in a modern building,"This is a must do activities in Athens and to do justice allow 3 to 4 hours rather than do a tour.

A price to pay for views with tough access via 250 steps,"Dealt with Cynthia. She he made the check in at the Amalfi Hotel. She arranged a porter to take up the 2 oversized cabin bags weighing around 15 kg each at a cost of €10 per bag. We later found that her husband in fact helped our neighbours get the bags upstairs. Her husband escorted us up 250 steps to the unit and showed us around. He showed us the safe, which after he had left I realised there were two supplied bolts lying on the floor of the safe which weren’t anchored! The shower head holder was broken, and the rain shower head a leak which shot a jet above the shower door and consequently squirting and completely wetting the bath mat and toilet seat. There was old food from the previous guests or even older for example oil and sugar which was left in the cupboard. Views as advertised and expected after 250 steps! Large roof top deck for day and night relaxation.",September 2019,Apartments Amalfi Design Sea View,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187780-d15699615-Reviews-Apartments_Amalfi_Design_Sea_View-Amalfi_Amalfi_Coast_Province_of_Salerno_Campania.html,"Amalfi, Italy",hotels,3.0,3.0
NEVER AGAIN NOR CAN I RECOMMEND THE DEBACLE!,"My wife and I went in the morning to confirm the arrangements and that you would be given a number and wait. Returned at 5:30 p.m. and we were given a ticket number 8 whilst a person outside wanted to swap it with us who joked because they had ticket number 17. We had already waited 35 minutes and went and sat down at a table that had not been cleared from the previous person. The plastes remained on the table for at least 15 minutes. Then we noticed a lot of other later arrivers getting their service earlier. Coinsidently number 17 was ready to leave and noted empty plates on a table, thinking they were our ones, and we would really have already been served. We said we haven't and they said that they have already finished two pizzas and are now leaving. Then 5 minutes later the pizzas came out (ONLY 2 choices, either Margherita or Marinara. Perhaps the tomato sauce had some expected flavour but the dough was chewy and soft and did not suit my palette particularly with the charred dough. Suddenly I felt a dripping over my right shoulder and drops on my head and as I looked up it was the leaking from the air conditioning unit. When I pointed it out I was informed it was just water and then when I tried to engage the maitre de he shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't understand English. When I spoke to the original person at reception, he seemed to take a similar approach and my wife noticed the person at the till was now the old man who was photographed with Julia Roberts on her visit. When I mentioned why our service was delayed citing number 17 as an example, all I received was a shrug of the shoulders ""I can speak English"". it was obvious no further action would be taken so I suggested I pay $5 instead of $10, and after deliberation, with the boss it was accepted.",September 2019,L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187785-d1235237-Reviews-L_Antica_Pizzeria_da_Michele-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Naples, Italy",restaurants,1.0,4.0
