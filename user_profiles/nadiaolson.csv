We did not go hiking in Tibet, but had plenty of walking in temples and monasteries and great road trips, including the Everest Base Camp. The longest day was from Lo Tingri, crossing the border and then the nine hour drive to Kathmandu. Next we flew to Bhutan where we had another very capable and knowledgeable guide and driver to show us the beautiful country of Bhutan.

"Excellent Tours of Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan","Mr. Rajan was superb in helping us to design a special three-country tour to Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan. We started in Nepal with some tours of Kathmandu and then went hiking to Poonhill, this place, that place and others. The hikes were great and Ramjee was a very conscientious and helpful guide. We flew back from Pokara, overnighted in Kathmandu and then flew to Tibet, another fabulous experience. We did not go hiking in Tibet, but had plenty of walking in temples and monasteries and great road trips, including the Everest Base Camp. The longest day was from Lo Tingri, crossing the border and then the nine hour drive to Kathmandu. Next we flew to Bhutan where we had another very capable and knowledgeable guide and driver to show us the beautiful country of Bhutan. Rajan took care of all the airline tickets, hotels or guest houses, visas, and the itinerary which was very done. We highly recommend Earthbound Expeditions and we will definitely use them again.
