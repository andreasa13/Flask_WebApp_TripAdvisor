Niagara Falls was somewhat disappointing . . . until,"we took the boat ride. Up close and personal with the falls was fun. Your feet get soaked, so don't wear slippery flip flops or sandals. It will be hard to walk off boat and up ramps. It was fun being in the midst of the mist. Best activity for me at Niagara Falls. Otherwise, very commerical and crowded. I can say I've been there . . .",July 2019,"Niagara Falls, Canada: Voyage to the Falls Boat Tour in Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g154998-d11454290-Niagara_Falls_Canada_Voyage_to_the_Falls_Boat_Tour_in_Canada-Niagara_Falls_Ontario.html,"Niagara Falls, Canada",activities,5.0,5.0

Good for the $$,"Owner very friendly and helpful with local attractions. Busy street in the evening and morning. Quiets down after about 11pm. Electrical outlets very loose - phone cords, etc. would not stay put.

What can you say . . .,"I love history, so this was truly another opportunity to see and be close to an iconic location. I always try to picture the people who were there thousands of years ago and know that I am walking where they walked. Very well preserved and lots of room to walk around in mid-April. Not so sure when busy season hits.

Best tour and guide you could ask for!,"Arrived in Athens in AM and decided to rest and schedule a late afternoon private tour with this company. Anabelia arrived at our hotel on time and smiling - ready to go! She is great, great, great! Can't say enough about her and the places she took us. All the food markets - fish, fresh vegetable, meat, etc. The connections they have to stop and taste a little of the local food . . . excellent. We enjoyed her company and she was very informative about the history of Athens, the best places to eat, where it was safe, etc. (Overall, Athens is a very safe city.) We feel like we made a true friend in Ana. She communicated with us after the tour via email if we had questions. Couldn't ask for a better way to start our vacation in Athens. You won't be sorry - truly!

"Nice location, great service...","Hotel is not new but the service was great. We asked a lot of questions and needed some recommendations and the staff was always available to help.

Nice but not excellent,"Nice place. Booked through our vacation package. I would not have chosen because it wasn't close to downtown, etc. No help with baggage. Finding room was confusing - different elevators, long walk with baggage, etc. Friendly desk staff.
