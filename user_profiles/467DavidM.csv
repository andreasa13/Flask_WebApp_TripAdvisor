"Fantastic restaurant, great staff, great location","Lovely fresh food, great cooking, very friendly staff, and a perfect location overlooking the port. The owner cooked up a special dinner for my son's 12th birthday and it was perfect, a highlight of our visit. Thanks George, we look forward to seeing you again next year!",July 2020,Hellas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g642171-d4926322-Reviews-Hellas-Parikia_Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Watersports fun - and great for first-timers,"This is a bit of a hidden gem, tucked into the corner of Kolimbithres Beach, easy to find, a lot of different activities, and the staff are very relaxed, professional, and great with first-timers. My son wanted to try waterskiing for his 12th birthday, and his 10-year-old sister joined in, and they could not have been in better hands. The teacher was very calm, very friendly, great with the kids, and taught a very simple but effective technique. First-timers start on an arm extending from the boat, so are close by and not at all out on their own, and within 10 minutes both were skiing happily on a normal rope tow. Then to top it off, they took a spin on the Flyfish for some extra thrills! It was a highlight of the birthday, and we will definitely be back when we return to Paros next summer. Highly recommended.",July 2020,WaterSkiZone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189432-d3531283-Reviews-WaterSkiZone-Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A uniquely wonderful holiday haven,"We have just spent 2 lovely weeks at Onira Studios in Parikia, extended from 1 week because we loved it so much we did not want to leave. (Naxos became a day-trip!). Owner Angelique treats all her guests as new friends, gives advice, makes bookings, suggests/organises outings (including an afternoon boat trip to three different swimming spots which was a highlight of our visit), helps with any problems that come up, prepares fabulous Greek food for breakfast and at other times if wanted, and most of all keeps the lovely gardens and pool as an oasis of calm and relaxation.

As we discovered (this was our first visit), Paros is a beautiful, low-key, very friendly island, and Onira is in the perfect location; a 3-minute walk to the sandy and protected Livadia Beach and only a few more minutes along the waterfront to the town and ferry port, but set back away from what passes in Parikia for the busy tourist spots. For a stay of more than a few days, definitely rent a car to explore the island (Angelique made the calls, and we had a car brought to us at the hotel for EUR 35 per day), but you will look forward to coming ‘home’ every evening.

We will be back next summer!",July 2020,Hotel Onira,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g642171-d3438736-Reviews-Hotel_Onira-Parikia_Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Wonderful traditional family-run restaurant in a fantastic location,"This is a wonderful family-run restaurant, now third-generation, with freshly-prepared traditional dishes using organic vegetables from their own farm, and fresh fish as good as any I’ve ever eaten; Nikolas goes out and catches it every morning! The location is perfect, right on the beach but away from the tourist hustle around the point, and the service is great; friendly and helpful, but also very professional. We were a family of four and had a lovely relaxed dinner, then were treated like old friends when we went back for some lunch and afternoon snacks the next day while waiting for our flight. Highly recommended – this is not just somewhere to eat; a meal here is a Mykonos ‘must-do’ highlight.",July 2020,Nikolas Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3344059-d2277068-Reviews-Nikolas_Taverna-Paraga_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Must-see context for your Athens Acropolis visit,"A must-see, sculptures and artefacts up close, lovely building, look through the floor at the ancient site underneath, and walk around it after you finish inside (note, last entry to the site is half an hour before closing). Ignore the over-officious guards and enjoy an airconditioned fleshing out of what you’ve just seen on the hill. Excellent.",July 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Belpaese Italian estaurant near the Acropolis Museum,"Food in Greece is a highlight, but not all good food in Athens is Greek. This Italian restaurant just off the tourist strip near the Acropolis Museum is a hidden gem. Modern, comfortable, friendly, excellent pizzas, and fish to rival any of the competition. Add organic beers from Tinos and a good selection of wine by the glass, a real find. Highly recommended.",July 2020,Belpaese Pasta Al Momento,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12955387-Reviews-Belpaese_Pasta_Al_Momento-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Viator Skip The Line Acropolis Tour,"This tour was excellent, and very good value after seeing much more expensive tours advertised. Our guide was very knowledgeable, very experienced, and gave us interesting background to all the sites. (She even expertly shepherded us between shady spots; don’t underestimate how welcome that is).. Small group (max 12), the meeting point is easy to find, you pay the guide cash for adult admission tickets, bring kids’ passports for free (EU) or reduced-price tickets, The tour ends at the Parthenon at the top, then look around and wander down at your own pace. Highly recommended.",July 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent option for Athens airport transfer,"This is an excellent option, highly recommended. Normal taxi cost, but personalized pickup. Our flight arrived very early, but when I Whatsapped the driver he was there in 5 minutes. Good car, dropped at our apartment door in a narrow back street. The company is very well run, arranged a driver with a station wagon when I let them know we had four bags. Excellent, we would definitely do this again.",July 2020,Athens Private Airport Transfer with 1 hour Sightseeing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g562627-d17576502-Athens_Private_Airport_Transfer_with_1_hour_Sightseeing-Spata_East_Attica_Region_A.html,"Spata, Greece",activities,5.0,4.5
Your Friends Animation brilliant again,"We found Tenuta Primero because the kids had outgrown our previous favourite camp in Italy, but they loved the Your Friends animation teams. So we checked their website for other camps where they provide the entertainment, sports, and kids club, liked the look of this coastal camp at the very top of the Adriatic, and booked in and hoped for the best.

And we were very happy that we did. The Your Friends crew were wonderful as always, very hard-working, always ready with a smile, always cheerfully helpful, and just wonderful with the kids (10 and 8 now). Sports, poolside games, kids club, and a show or special event every night, all with a warm-hearted group the kids were very sad to leave.

And the camp is also excellent. Well-established, very well-run, clean, good facilities, a decent grocery shop with all the basics, and very good restaurants. The pool area is big, lots of shade, and (in July anyway) only rarely completely full. There’s an artificial-turf football field, tennis courts, and a lot of beach (sandy) and lagoon walks, and for grown-ups, a club on the marina waterfront. Apart from a jetty out into deeper water, the beach is not really suited to swimming, but the main town beach a short drive away in Grado apparently is - we might try that next year.

We stayed in a bungalow, good size, very quiet, but all the cabins looked in good condition, many very new. And unlike some holiday parks, Tenuta Primero still has a lot of van and tent sites, a good mix. Top it off with very professional and helpful staff. Highly recommended.",July 2018,Resort Tenuta Primero,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g194776-d1933068-Reviews-Resort_Tenuta_Primero-Grado_Province_of_Gorizia_Friuli_Venezia_Giulia.html,"Grado, Italy",hotels,5.0,3.5
Still definitive New York,"This is the essence of New York, and 35 years after the first time it's still a buzz stepping out onto the observation deck on the 87th floor. 'Going up the Empire State' used to be messy, with long waits for tickets, and longer waits for lifts; now they could teach Disney a thing or two about efficiently moving large numbers of people. Order your ticket online, choose a fine day, go relatively early in the morning, print the ticket when you arrive, read (or bypass) all the history and background information displays, and either go straight up (the earlier the better, it opens at 9), or join very organised lines. Minimal selling on the way up (the usual photo opportunity), lots of merchandise to buy when you come down. But yes, it's all worth it - you see the whole of NYC from its iconic (for once appropriate) centre. Take your time, make your own memories, but don't miss it!",September 2015,Empire State Building,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d104365-Reviews-Empire_State_Building-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,4.0,4.5
Best free ferry ride in the world,"Take an hour out on the water away from the New York hustle and bustle to see the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, and the Manhattan skyline (and ponder what isn't there any more). Sit/stand at the back on the way to Staten Island for the Manhattan/Brooklyn Bridge views, and after leaving the ferry and joining the next one going back, sit on the statue side for the return trip.The natural harbour is nothing to look at, but the built parts are, and it's always nice to get out on the water. And yes, it's still free.",September 2015,Staten Island Ferry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d143363-Reviews-Staten_Island_Ferry-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent family camping,"We reviewed Piantelle in 2012 and 2013, and have just thoroughly enjoyed our third visit (July 2014). This time we stayed in a larger (3BR) onsite van, but all the accommodation we've had has been excellent - clean, comfortable, and efficiently airconditioned. The staff continue to be very friendly and helpful, the location is of course still brilliant, and the (different) entertainment crew were again great - always a smile for the guests, especially the little ones, and our now 6- and 4-year-olds were very sad to leave them. As well as presenting a different show (with lots of dancing) for the kids each night, they run very relaxed kids clubs from 10-12 and 15.30 until late afternoon, so as well as swimming in the lake or the clean and very well-run pools, there's always something different for the little ones to do.

The owners continue to make improvements, which this year included a roped-off swimming area for the (pebbly) beach on the lake, and the whole place has a wonderfully relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Happy to confirm again that Piantelle remains a great experience for young families and is very highly recommended.",July 2014,Piantelle Camping,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g664152-d1515439-Reviews-Piantelle_Camping-Moniga_del_Garda_Province_of_Brescia_Lombardy.html,"Moniga del Garda, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
