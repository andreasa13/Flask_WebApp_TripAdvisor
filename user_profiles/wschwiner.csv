Have to do at least once,A wondrous adventure. Why would you not do this at least once after going all the way to Athens. The weather was good when we went the first week in November.

loud,"I stayed in unit 3 on the 4th floor. The construction of the unit is very poor. The bathroom door only opens about 75% of the way due to a beam running on the ceiling. There is a central metal trash dumpster on the corner below the unit. There is no sound damping between the unit that shares a window with this unit. The person in unit 4 was talking on the phone, it sounded like he was standing next to our bed. This unit shares a large plate glass window with unit 4 and there is a space between where the wall ends against the window of about 1/2"" Some one could easy slip a spy camera into that space. Bags of bottles are being dropped into the metal trash container late at night after the business close and early in the morning, 05:00- 05:30, a large truck comes buy to pic up the container and deliver an empty one. There is also a high pressure water compressor they use to wash the area every morning. You might as well be sleeping in the street noise wise.

On the positive side, good location and nice common area with all the stuff you need except ear plugs.",November 2019,Xenofontos Inn by Livin Urbban,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d14972683-Reviews-Xenofontos_Inn_by_Livin_Urbban-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,1.0,2.0

Deep snork,"We did 3 days 2 nights snorkeling on the reef from Cairns. A good dive site may not be a good snorkeling site and a good snorkeling spot may not be a good dive site.They did a good job of moving around to provided opportunities that were well balanced to accommodate both divers and snorkelers. I did not at any time feel that they favored one over the other and realize that diving offers better opportunities on the reef than snorkeling. Saw sharks, rays, schools of fish, many types reef fish, many of coral and, yes; I did find Nimo. The live a board accommodations were better than I was expecting. I would rate the food at a 60%.
