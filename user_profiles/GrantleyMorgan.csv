A truly Greek experience!,"Head to Street Souvlaki - wonderful flavours, light on the pocket. Baba Au Rhum and The Clumsies were recently awarded places in the top 50 bars worldwide - easy to see why with blends like theirs!!",October 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
The cradle of democracy,"Idyllic at sunset - this is a pilgrimage anyone interested in politics, ancient history or architecture should take. The Ancient Greeks were light years ahead of their time. Leaves one wondering, what would they make of the world today? I'd wager it would be better for their revival.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
My favourite hotel in the world!,"From the moment you leave the Check-in desk, every experience and interaction you have at the Grand Hyatt can be a memorable one. From the Atrium Pool to the stunning Rooftop, the sumptuous Spa to decadent dining, the Grand Hyatt has everything you might want during your Athens stay.

Beautifully appointed rooms, as supremely clean as the rest of the hotel, provide an excellent base from which to explore Athens. Though you may take a while to leave the hotel, thanks to the stunning facilities and incredible team which awaits you.

Say Hi to Alex and Anthi at the rooftop bar for me, challenge the hosts to bring the tastes of the world to your cocktail journey, and take a little time to learn about the team's individual stories. Each member I found to be genuinely interested in guest interaction. Mary is simply fantastic - politics calls one day, but enjoy her wonderful presence while you can.

You wont regret a single minute of your Grand Hyatt Athens stay, so book now and escape to the luxurious oasis of Athens.",October 2019,Grand Hyatt Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15009871-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
"Comfortable and welcoming base from which to explore Looe, Polperro, Mevagissey and the Eden Project.","Gill and Martin provide excellent quality accommodation, great food and a home-from-home welcome at the Porlaen Country House Hotel. Rooms are well appointed and provide everything you need for a comfortable stay. We stayed in the King room, complete with en-suite shower, Freesat HD TV and king size bed. The standards of cleanliness were top class, including all towels and linen. Overall, the room was of a very good size and very enjoyable.

Breakfast included a large range of options, including Full English, Eggs Benedict and Croissants for the main serving. Those choices are supplemented by a range of cereals, yoghurts, fruits, juices and toast. All meat and eggs were locally sourced and tasted fantastic! We enjoyed the Full English and Croissants twice and the meals were of a consistently high quality. Overall, breakfast at the Porlaen provides a great start to the day.

Other facilities include a fully licensed bar, guests' lounge and dinner menu available at an additional rate. The bar and lounge were well appointed and available for guests to use at all times, and while we did not eat with the hotel in the evening, I have no doubt that the quality of the food would match that of the breakfast meals.

The hotel is located just 2 miles outside of Looe, in Sandplace. It is a stone's throw away from Sandplace Station on the Looe Valley line, and therefore provides an excellent base to explore the Looe Valley whether on foot, by rail or by car. Buses also stop just outside the hotel at regular intervals. Parking outside the hotel is ample, ensuring that you can leave the car and explore by other means should you wish. Aside from
Looe, attractions such as the Eden Project, Lost Gardens of Heligan, Charlestown Talllships, and Bodmin Jail are all less than half an hour away. The fishing villages of Polperro (10 mins) and Mevagissey (45 mins) can also be reached with ease and provide a picturesque stop during your stay in Cornwall.

I'd fully recommend making the Porlaen Hotel your number one choice. Gill and Martin are sure to offer the best welcome, accommodation, food and hospitality to be found in the area, and are always on hand to ensure that your stay is the best it can be. For a truly memorable stay on the Cornish coast, make it the Porlaen.",June 2012,Polraen Country House Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186237-d1016132-Reviews-Polraen_Country_House_Hotel-Looe_Cornwall_England.html,"Looe, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,5.0
