Couple with dog,"Always on the look out gor a dog friendly Pub, i found this place. Regularly go to other pubs in the area but was the first time here.

Beautiful old pub, really lovely and friendly staff and the food..... My partner is Malaysian and was convinced the chef must be asian with the quality of the Asian inspired food options.

As a vegetarian I was well catered for.

Thankyou for a lovely evening. We will be back!!",October 2020,The Bowl Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1096430-d2239477-Reviews-The_Bowl_Inn-Almondsbury_Gloucestershire_England.html,"Almondsbury, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Slow and Lactustre,"I'll begin with the good points:

- the poached eggs are nice

And now the bad points:

- Nobody is ever Ever at the 'Wait to be seated sign'
- The coffee machine which normally accompanies the breakfast wasn't working, so you had to play 'hunt the coffee maker'. Today the coffee machine has been replaced by an urn of coffee. This was fine for me as I just take coffe black, but for those fans of Latte and Cappuccino, zilch.
- The buffet is light on the ground for a normal Premier Inn Breakfast.
- If you want a cooked breakfast, be prepared to play 'hunt the waitress'. She's a lovely woman, but she seems to not notice people.",November 2019,Derby Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1727851-d3579405-Reviews-Derby_Lodge-Huyton_Merseyside_England.html,"Huyton, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0

Lovely location,"Took a bus tour from Athens. It took around 1.5 hours. Total cost was about €40 each, which did seem a little steep really. Entry to the site was €8 and was included in the price. We were allowed to roam for 1 hour.

Once there we walked up to the temple ruins, which were interesting but not really any more magnificent than the others we'd seen in Athens itself.

As previous reviews have said, the location is what makes it.

There is a small cafe at the bottom of the hill which we had a drink in.

1 hour was really enough time to be there as there is nothing to do once you've seen the temple.",November 2019,Temple of Poseidon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562628-d312283-Reviews-Temple_of_Poseidon-Sounio_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Sounio, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Lovely Lovely Lovely,"We didn't know the oublic trabsport routes and didn't manage to get an uber, so we walked up to the funicular. It's a loooooong walk and up hill!!

The funicular is €7 return. I don't think i could have walked as we went for the sunset and had had a very busy day of walking.

There is a restaurant, bar and chapel at the top, but the main attraction is the wonderful views of the city, coastline and isalnds.

It's a lovely place to see the sun set. Take some drinks or get a drink in the bar or from the street sellers.

Soulless Stay,"This was my first time in Benidorm with my mum and younger sister. It isn't normally the kind of holiday I would go on unless it is to party with friends, but I will try my best to be as unbiased as possible.

Good Points:

- There are 2 pools. A large outdoor and a smaller indoor (adult only) pool. The main pool is a sun trap. There is also a pool bar open from June onwards.
- They have happy hour twice per day (draught lager and cider is 2 for 1).
- There is a mini market in the main building with a good choice of items.
- Staff are friendly.
- Rooms are well equipped

Not so good points:

- It's far from the hustle and bustle - 40 minutes walk and alot of that is uphill. I was very glad I had booked a mobility scooter for my mum.
- Breakfast is nice, but wouldn't waste your time with the evening buffet. The food was vile and the free drinks were all horrible. Well done for ruining draft Pepsi, Orange and 7up!!
- The whole place is just a bit drab. There isn't really an atmosphere. If you're a parent who likes getting pissed and leaving their kids run through corridors until all hours.... This is your place. If you go away to have fun, you won't be impressed.
- Entertainment was the least entertaining I think I've ever seen. It consisted of a woman setting up a karaoke stand and letting kids just walk up and screech whilst she danced like an idiot. I think it would be a No from Simon.
- WiFi is charged. Who even does that in 2019?!
- The gym is also chargeable

All in all I didn't hate the place because I only used it to sleep in. If you want to be close to everything benidorm has to offer then don't stay here. If you would like evening entertainment and decent food, don't stay here.

It may seem cheap for the money but you will quickly rack up a big spend on taxis if you want to leave the place, or you need to be fit!!

I wouldn't stay here again.",May 2019,Terralta Apartamentos Turisticos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187525-d287291-Reviews-Terralta_Apartamentos_Turisticos-Benidorm_Costa_Blanca_Province_of_Alicante_Valencian_C.html,"Benidorm, Spain",hotels,2.0,4.0
"Long Wait, Patronising Staff","The place is badly managed. There is no coordination between staff.

Food took an hour to come, it was ok, not exceptionally difficult to put a bit of smashed avocado on a bit of toasted bread.

Coke machine wasn't working.

The young female staff member with hair tied up in a pony tail was exceptionally rude and Patronising to everyone.

I won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend the place",January 2019,The Prince of Teck,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2170107-Reviews-The_Prince_of_Teck-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,3.5
WOW!!!,"The reviews do not lie. This place has been (by far) the best hotel we have stayed in out of 4 in the past 2 weeks and I would go as far to say that it's the best hotel I've stayed in full stop.

This hotel goes beyond just 5 star. The staff are absolutely wonderful, attentive, friendly, helpful and genuine.

The hotel is just beautiful, rooms are gorgeous, the pool is gorgeous and it's in a great location with some very nice eateries (including Viroth's Restaurant) in the locality.

Guests are greeted with a cold towel to clean your hands every time you enter the hotel.

When leaving the hotel at night you are offered mosquito spray which they apply for you.

Nothing is too much really.

We didn't know about the free taxi to the hotel from the airport, so they took us to the airport instead after our stay (in the Rolls Royce no less).

This will definitely be my hotel of choice when I return to Siem Reap. Please expand throughout Asia!!

Passable,"In short this should not be classified as a 5 star hotel.

- Rooms are small
- Staff are not attentive.
- Pool is small
- Toiletries are not replenished
- Minibar is empty (hostel style service provided where you buy your drinks at the bar downstairs)

All in all pretty disappointing. After staying at the (4 Star) Pullman Hotel G just last week on my way through Bangkok to Phuket, I was expecting big things from the 5 star Amara. Unfortunately it hasn't delivered.

I will in future spend less money and stay at the Pullman G Hotel. Rooms there were much bigger and better with nicer views, staff were wonderful and (premium) toiletries were replenished daily. The po was also pleasant, around the samesize as the amara only less the infinity part (very small price to pay really for everything else you get).

Nice but Naughty,"We went as a couple to savour the splendour of the view.

Firstly, this is not the only bar in this building. We were encouraged to go to the 53rd floor to Lebua No.3. It was ok but the ambience was a bit boring. This is the newest bar in the building apparently. We paid around £40 for 2 drinks and then left in search of the famous sky bar.

We were escorted to another bar and quickly realised this wasn't the sky bar either. We had 2 more drinks at £40+ for the pair.

FINALLY..... We expressed much interest and determination in getting to the sky bar and we got there.

The view is incredible, the bar is perched 64 floors above the street below (it's a good job I had those cocktails at the other bars really). Another £40+ for 2 cocktails and er got the photos and experience we went for.

We were led out of the building not via the grand entrance which we arrived, but instead through what seemed to be another chance to make money.... The taxi end. We declined and ended up having to walk up a pretty dangerous dual carriageway.

All in all the view was lovely. Was it worth £130? Maybe not.

If money is no object then go, if you're on a budget then just insist that you get to the sky bar at all costs and don't get suckered in by each bar.

Wow!! If only all budget hotels were like this,"This is the beginning of my 2nd stay at the Oliver Cromwell and I must say I am completely bowled over by the whole place.

I work away 90% of the year, so I get used to staying in the likes of Premier Inn and Travelodge, which are generally ok, however, this time I am working in Chatteris for 6 weeks and this was the best value and closest to my work, so my company were happy to book me in for the next 6 weeks and I am SO glad that they have!!

The staff are such warm and welcoming people. The rooms are spacious, newly refurbished and clean and comfortable. The bar food is astonishingly good for the price AND there's the added bonus of the leisure facilities.

On top of all of this, I overhead a staff member talking about packed lunches. Upon asking at reception, my order was taken to pick up a packed lunch (of my choice), because I will miss breakfast.

I've stayed in some very nice hotels and this kind of service is really well above what I, and no doubt many others would expect of a budget hotel.

Keep up the good work!! I am very much looking forward to spending my down time relaxing in your hotel for the next 6 weeks!!

Great find!!,"I stayed the weekend in Minehead for work and my boyfriend came to stay with me. We came here for dinner on Saturday evening.

There was a large party of people so the service was a little slow, but we were in no rush and we accepted this. As it was warm we happily sat outside with drinks and chatted between courses.

Starter: We had 1 Camembert and 1 Fishcake starter. Both were really beatiful.

The Main: We had 1 Salmon and 1 Chicken in white wine sauce. This is what let the meal down really. Both dishes were bland and the salmon was overcooked.

Dessert: We had 1 Cheesecake and 1 Crumble. These are both delicious.

The bill came in at around £60 for 3 courses and 3 drinks each(3 coke and 3 cider). We were both very please with the price we paid.

The staff were lovely and the manager/owner was friendly, helpful and attentive.

Beautiful trip,"I came to Minehead for work and my boyfriend joined me for the weekend. On Sunday we went on the steam train, just to dunster. It was a great experience as neither of us had been on a steam train before.

Great food and cheap!!,"Came here for Sunday lunch and it was just what we wanted.

I was a little disappointed that there was no vegetarian option for the Sunday lunch, but I ordered a cheese and onion chutney sandwich, which was very nice.

The side of plates were a little Greasy and not really worth £4, but they were edible.

Average but Pleasant,"I travel frequently with work and happened to be staying in the Premier Inn next door. I was going to walk up to the wetherspoons in town but it has been a very wet day, so I came here for convenience.

Firstly, the welcoming staff were lovely and friendly, helping me by telling me that what I wanted wasn't one of the dishes that weren't available on the day. Bar staff were again friendly.

Now the not so good points:

The place is clearly understaffed, however there was someone conducting an interview as I ordered at the bar. There was a long wait in between the starter and main course and I can see how this would annoy some people, especially those with children. Tge waitress asked me if I would like any other sauces with my toad in the hole with gravy. I thought this was a little unnecessary and a bit robot like, but then I suppose she's doing what she is told to.

The food was actually very nice when it arrived. This is pub grub at the end of the day. If you want something special then go somewhere else and pay a premium for it.

As for previous comments saying that the staff did nothing about children running about..... Would that really go down with parents?! Control your kids or get a takeaway and save the rest of us non children wanting people.

They serve Food,"As someone who works away from home 5 days a week, sometimes I go out with colleagues and sometime I prefer to eat alone (There's only so much work talk that can be had)

Tonight was a night where I wanted to eat alone and outside of my hotel. I had heard that the food was decent here, so as it was near I thought I would try it, initially walking in for takeaway, but deciding I would stay and eat as it was quiet.

First things first, if you are a solo eater here, the chutney tray does not reach your table.... Obviously I wasn't spending enough to get the 50p worth of poppadom and sauces, yet the array of equally boring eating partners around me happily tucked in (the waiter with a cough probably discharged in it anyway so I wasn't offended).

Secondly.... As a solo eater, you have more time to take in your surroundings and my what a delight (slight hint of sarcasm) they are.

If you like the colour red then you're in for a treat, if you like dirty and aged red then you will not want to leave. If you like dirty, aged, gloomy red surroundings then you will almost certainly reach climax.

Unfortunately, my love for these characteristics is about as much as my love for bungee jumping whilst drinking a pint of cats urine.

Service.... Service?....... Service????...... Again, the £24 I spent as a solo eater wasn't enough to be served with enthusiasm. Waiting for drinks and generally being ignored were particular highlights of the evening, along with being hurried along to eat up, pay and vacate the delightful establishment (if you can call it that).

The food was below average, the service is better in Tesco across the road and the surroundings are what you might expect from a lap dancing bar in Neath Port Talbot.

"Work event, Pleasant Stay","The arrival to Horwood House is exciting and beautiful. Make you way up a long drive and you can just make out the manor house at the top. The setting couldn't be more perfect.

The house part of the hotel is lovely, with stone doorways and darkwood panelling, just as you would expect. However, the rest of the hotel and conference suites are additions and do detract a little from this beautiful setting.

The hotel has been extensively extended and then some more. Upon trying to find my room (number 236), I met a man who had actually been given a map in order to find his room!!

The room...... It was rather small, dated and a little shabby in places, but the bed was comfortable and it did the job seeing as I was only spending one night there anyway.

We had the conference buffets for breakfast and lunch and a 3 course meal at night. All food was decent and the selection was outstanding. So much to eat, I think I left a stone heavier.

The majority of my group found signal on EE to be non existent and the wifi was quite poor in the room, but good in all communal areas!!

I was leaving for a trip straight from the hotel and the manager was kind enough to let me leave my car at the hotel over the weekend (I had already called previously to ask, so I wouldn't assume!!).

The thing with Warsaw is there isn't as much to do as there is in Paris, so unless you are determined to see the 10 attractions which you can get into for free with the Warsaw Pass, or you find that you can make use of the discounts, I wouldn't really recommend.

There are lots of souvenir shops, restaurants, bars and cafe's to visit.

This is the great place for a party or a relax.

Inexpensive trip and some beautiful views from St Mary's Church Tower.",June 2016,Old Town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274856-d284330-Reviews-Old_Town-Warsaw_Mazovia_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Warsaw, Poland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful,"Great place to go for a walk, cycle, run or a picnic.

Beautiful setting with the Kings Spa House located in the grounds, which are well worth a visit!!

The café serves nice desserts but the staff were very incompetent.

Nice for a leisurely day out and quite central!!",June 2016,Łazienki Królewskie w Warszawie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274856-d284409-Reviews-Lazienki_Krolewskie_w_Warszawie-Warsaw_Mazovia_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Warsaw, Poland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good if you are interested in jewish interest,"You could spend hours in here.

There were bits I found very interesting.

This museum tells you the complete history of Jewish faith and the trials and tribulations which they have faced.

There are artefacts and interactive things to do!!",June 2016,POLIN Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274856-d573045-Reviews-POLIN_Muzeum_Historii_Zydow_Polskich-Warsaw_Mazovia_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Warsaw, Poland",attractions,4.0,4.5
Beautiful and Great view from the tower!!,"We visited on a Sunday and there was a service in full swing. People were queuing out of the out of the door.

We had a quick look inside and climbed the tower.

The views were lovely!! There is a lift but I'm not sure if that is available to visitors..... I think there are apartments up the tower.

It's quite a climb, but worth it!! Only 5 zloty each",June 2016,St. Anne's Church (Kosciol Swietej Anny),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274856-d274995-Reviews-St_Anne_s_Church_Kosciol_Swietej_Anny-Warsaw_Mazovia_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Warsaw, Poland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very Nice Food. Nice Atmosphere,"Myself and a group of friends went here for Sunday Lunch. We went last minute and didn't have a reservation, but thankfully we managed to find a few tables underneath the pergola. I would suggest booking if it was an important event though.

The pub itself is nicely decorated and the garden is lovely in the sun, with nice shaded areas. Staff were friendly and polite.

The Sunday lunch was one of the best I've ever had. There is a nice selection of Meat, Fish and Vegetarian dishes available. My partner and I ate half of a Grilled Gurnard and Clam dish and half of a beef dinner and both were very nice.

The portion size was ample for me, but I would say that anyone with a large appetite should probably consider adding sides to the meal. This is Gastro pub style food, so you don't get heaps and mounds, but you do get food of a nice standard which is presented well!! Main dishes cost £10 upwards.

I will definitely return.",June 2016,The Spotted Cow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186220-d2030851-Reviews-The_Spotted_Cow-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Lovely Afternoon,"Myself and my partner travelled up from Leicester to take advantage of a 'Mr and Mrs' afternoon tea voucher received for a birthday.

Bakewell is a really nice town and the shop and café is equally quaint.

Staff were very friendly and accommodating. It's hard to find such good service in a restaurant.

The food was abundant. In fact too much for just 2 people!! The quality was brilliant. Sandwiches were well filled and the cakes were amazing!! I have a very sweet tooth, but there was too much even for me (We had to take some home not to waste it!!).

I would highly recommend one of these afternoons as a gift or for your own pleasure.

Thank you for your hospitality!!",June 2016,Original Bakewell Pudding Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g209968-d2436049-Reviews-Original_Bakewell_Pudding_Shop-Bakewell_Peak_District_National_Park_England.html,"Bakewell, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Long Term Business Stay,"I am currently staying at the Deptford Bridge StayCity ApartHotel and will be for the next few months with work.

Deptford isn't the most desirable location, but with access to the DLR (less than a minute from the front door) and a bus route right past the front door, it's easy to explore.

There are plenty of convenience stores within a couple of minutes walk, and Deptford High Street is only a 5 minute walk away, where there is everything you could need for a short stay. The Royal Albert pub is around a 10 minute walk (in a straight line) from the apartments and is nice for a sociable drink and they also serve food.

The staff at the apartments are friendly, helpful and efficient.

The rooms are modern and well equipped with a microwave/Grill, Cooking hob, dishwasher a fridge with small freezer compartment, and a dining area. All eating and cooking equipment and towels, shower gel and hand soap are included in the price.

I have stayed in one of the smaller rooms, which although quite small had everything in it. Although I do prefer the larger rooms, with a HUGE bed and separation between the kitchen/dining area and the bed area.

All in all for the price I think the apartments are great!! I would definitely recommend to anyone!!",May 2016,Staycity Aparthotels Deptford Bridge Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d6002637-Reviews-Staycity_Aparthotels_Deptford_Bridge_Station-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
"Nice Location, Ok hotel","I have stayed here on a number of occasions, for both work and leisure.

My first stay (leisure) was very pleasant. I was located in a room to the front of the hotel. The room was large and well appointed. Room service was average hotel quality and the staff were pleasant. Parking was an issue as there are very limited spaces compared to the enormous size of the hotel.

My second stay was recently and a few years since my first stay. The room I was placed in was in the eaves of the hotel. Small, Dark, Cramped and generally not very nice to go back after a long days work.

This spurred me on to find alternative accommodation which was closer to work and cheaper for the company. Whilst I waited for this to be actioned, I stayed another week at The Clarendon. This time, my room was huge, with a King size bed, 2 single beds and room to swing a reasonably sized cat. A bit ridiculous for 1 person to occupy really.

As with a lot of the big older hotels, some of the rooms have been renovated, but some are lacking attention. It's just pot luck to where you end up really.

The communal areas of the hotel are very nice and the breakfast selection is really quite hard to beat. The Breakfast staff are attentive and friendly.

All in all I wouldn't say that The Clarendon is a bad hotel, but I have stayed in nicer places for the money (£100+ per night).",April 2016,The Clarendon Hotel - Blackheath Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d289375-Reviews-The_Clarendon_Hotel_Blackheath_Village-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
"Great Food, Nice atmosphere, Friendly Staff","My partner and I have been here several times.

My partner is Singaporean and has said that this is the best place that he eaten Asian food since he has moved to the UK 2 years ago.

The prices are reasonable and the food is of good quality.

For some reason, whenever we have gone the place seems to not be completely full, but steady, which adds to the nice chilled atmosphere, but due to the standard it should be rammed!!",April 2016,Zheng Restaurant Oxford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186361-d6211259-Reviews-Zheng_Restaurant_Oxford-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html,"Oxford, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Great Company, Great Food, Mediocre Service","Shared New Years Eve with a group of friends here. It was my first time, but the majority of them had been before. The service was bad to say the least - Having to repeat orders; waiting extended periods for drinks to arrive and nobody seeming to know what was going on. Having said that, when the food arrived, it was delicious. I'd say if you're not in a hurry and; you're with a group of people who can fill those long waits in between with interesting conversation then go to this place. You won't be dissapointed with the menu!!",December 2014,Red Chilli 2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190729-d2528362-Reviews-Red_Chilli_2-Wakefield_West_Yorkshire_England.html,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
In need of TLC,"The hotel is tired and broken everywhere you look. This could be a very attractive and comfortable building if only the owners would put a few quid into it!!

Communal areas are decidedly better than the hidden delights of the rooms. I work in construction and have a keen eye for finishes..... Flaws are galore in this place. Broken tiles, old fashioned (not to be confused with antique) furniture, terrible shower and a TV which is vastly disproportionate to the room.... All underwhelming features of room 244.

The bed is comfy and there are the general features you could expect in an average hotel (Iron, Hairdryer, Tea and Coffee facilities etc).

Perfectly located to visit the delights of Hereford, with the beautiful cathedral just 1 minute walk away.

If you're looking for an ok cheap hotel then you won't be disappointed.",July 2014,The Green Dragon Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186302-d192858-Reviews-The_Green_Dragon_Hotel-Hereford_Herefordshire_England.html,"Hereford, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,3.5
Don't judge a book by the cover,"The Park Hotel is a grand and imposing building, located very close to the amenities of Teddington. I have stayed here for a number of weeks and have been booked in up for the next couple of months with work.

The first night's stay was comfortable. Room was decent, staff were pleasant and breakfast was nice.

However, since that stay I have been left somewhat underwhelmed. The check in staff are always friendly and helpful and there are a number of the breakfast staff who are equally accomodating. BUT, If you happen to go to breakfast on the wrong day you will be less than impressed by your experience.

Some of the breakfast staff seem to care not about the fact guests have been sat for 15 minutes and not offered coffee or toast, or even the fact that there are no glasses in order to consume your the juice, but more about chatting merrily amongst themselves.

Rooms are hit and miss. Some have all facilites, some are lacking a table or a hairdryer here and there.

The hotel is comfortable, but slightly dated as mentioned in previous comments. The evening meals are really lovely and the evening staff are very friendly and accomodating. It's a relatively inexpensive stay (especially if paid by work) and the local area is pleasant.

Heathrow is quite close by and it certainly scores higher than a Travelodge, but I have stayed in much nicer hotels for the money.",March 2014,The Park Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g528818-d285058-Reviews-The_Park_Hotel-Teddington_Richmond_upon_Thames_Greater_London_England.html,"Teddington, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,3.5
Average Food. Terrible Service,"This was my 2nd visit and having had a decent (if slow) service on my 1st visit, I was willing to give the place another go.

The pub has a ""wait to be seated"" policy, but if you did that, you would die of old age before you got to eat a morsel. As a result, myself, my mother and my sister took it upon ourselves to find a table off our own back.

The pub is full of character and we felt quite happy with our corner table.

Once we had made our choices, we made our way to the bar to order. A slow and uncomfortably mundane service eventually found its way to us and we attempted to order. The young guy hardly knew what day it was and had to have our order (burgers with a pate topping) explained to him no less than 3 times. Anyway, we (eventually) managed to clear this complicated (Huh) combination and pay.

We made our way back to our seating area and 2 of the 3 dishes were delivered shortly afterwards. Around 15 minutes later, our table was approached by what seemed to be the only table server (all others seemed to be too busy flirting and having fun with each other), when he asked what meal we were waiting for. He was told and then disappeared and decided to set up the empty tables in the room.

5 minutes later, my burger (with pate slapped on the plate) and ""gourmet"" (greasy) chips arrived. With nothing which resembled a slight apology for the wait, he was off to serve whatever else was in his other hand.

Only once I had eaten half of my food (and my mother and sister had eaten almost all of theirs), was the condiment tray brought to the table. I simply had to abruptly tell the ignorant idiot to leave or he would of been wearing the condiment tray.

To cut this tale short, my advice is to avoid this pub. Go to a Wetherspoon - The food and service may be dreadful, but they certainly live up to your expectations and it costs half the price.

Food was hit and miss but there are plenty of nice places to eat around the hotel andf the room service menu more than makes up for this.
