Nice place to go shopping,"Clothes, food, gadgets, all brands, all budgets and an Attica shop included.

Gets packed on weekends but easy to park and walk around most of the time.

The younger ones will also have a good time as there are seasonal decorations and activities all year round.

Good crowd, no weirdos is a decisive factor considering how malls tend to attract some people you don’t want to meet with young children...",November 2018,Golden Hall Mall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562636-d2691981-Reviews-Golden_Hall_Mall-Chalandri_Attica.html,"Chalandri, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
What a wonderful surprise!,"Who would have thought you could find a genuine Italian restaurant in the most off the track area in Athens?
At Lollo’s, you come for the pizza and you end up trying a bit of everything. The pasta is amazing! The chef speaks many languages so no worries if you are not a local and there is an actual Italian Manager making sure you stick to the rule book.
All in all, a great place for a simple and tasty lunch or dinner.",January 2019,Lollo’s,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g562636-d15597973-Reviews-Lollo_s-Chalandri_Attica.html,"Chalandri, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Epic finish of the Athens Marathon,"Run 5km, 10km or the whole 42km if you can, the finish will be the best experience you will ever have!!!

Enoteca with real Italian flair,"Vast choice of wines (it’s really a wine bar) and good dishes and platters to accompany the wine but most of all, a very professional and friendly staff, a very committed owner (it’s rare enough when you get to meet them) and a very original decoration and atmosphere makes this place a must go to for those who find themselves a bit hungry and thirsty for good wine after a shopping day in the city center.
Highly recommended!!!",December 2018,Brunello,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d13834074-Reviews-Brunello-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good surprise,"We were looking for a place to have a glass of wine and a steak and Vagabond appeared!

An amazing place for date night,"Finding places to eat is easy in Athens. Finding places to eat with a view is more rare. But finding the trifecta with a place to eat, enjoy the view and have a fantastic night out is unique!
Island is the place everyone dreams of. Great food, friendly staff, colorful drinks and dancing music all types of people can enjoy and dance to.
If you come earlier, you will admire a wonderful sunset and if you stay late, have a drink after your dinner and dance until the sun rises again.

Celebrating two Birthdays,"We made a reservation with the friendly maitre d and he booked one of the best tables in the place. Great view, good food and wonderful staff. The weather was perfect to sit on the terrace and enjoy the sunset and the view of the Acropolis, Monastiraki and Licabethus despite the seats still being soaking wet after the storm (the only negative note of the evening!).
I recommend the linguine with seafood if you are hungry as it seems to be a never ending dish!!!

A quiet place to eat,"The food is delicious whatever the time of the day.
Brunch, lunch, dinner or simply have a coffee and a piece of cake in the afternoon, this place is the perfect choice.
You can enjoy a non smoking area inside (seat close to the window so you still get the terrace feeling) and dive into the menu.
The dishes are smartly named after famous actors so order anything you like (there are vegetarian, meat and fish dishes) and enjoy a peaceful dinner being able to talk to whoever shares this moment with you without having to yell over loud music.",July 2018,Nice N Easy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1026500-d6508901-Reviews-Nice_N_Easy-Kifissia_Attica.html,"Kifissia, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Be part of History,"This is the one monument to visit should you ever be in Athens.

"Loud, smoky, not nice","If you are looking for a quiet place with good food and service, don’t come here.
Much ado about nothing.

Typical Andalusian cuisine with a twist,"Seville is home to the tapas so if you feel like eating some with an extra fusion side, go nowhere else!

"Trying to look cool, end up being total idiots","The hotel might be conveniently located and the rooms decently comfortable, the level of customer service is abysmal.
30 minutes waiting time to check in when you already checked in online, no reaction despite calling them out on that, being interrupted in the rudest way by a guest when you finally getting there and actually end up interacting with the clerk for exactly 2 seconds, seeing the reception clerk not telling the guest to wait or that they are being rude, see a senior staff jump in a conversation without even introducing herself and undermining her colleague's credibility, apologizing but really doing nothing, are real examples of how I was treated despite a Gold status earned spending thousands of dollars with the group. Definitely not up to Marriott standards.
I wanted to be faithful and stay in a Marriott property despite the other hotels in Berlin being fully booked, paid the same price as in another hotel of the group with much smarter/skilled employees but ended up being very disappointed. Will never come back. Good riddance would they say and that is exactly the problem: the problem is not their attitude, the problem is the person who calls them out. When the person is gone, they believe that the problem is solved...

The beating heart of Munich,"When you speak about Munich, the Oktoberfest, the Frauenkirche, theAllianz Arena and BMW or the Olympic Park come up. Marienplatz is nevertheless the heart of Munich. On this square, you will experience the real life of the people living in Munich. From the wonderful Town Hall to the shopping experience, everything you have to see is there. Terraces to enjoy a beer or the typical Bavarian food, the History, the spiritual connection of the city with the Virgin Mary, you can discover all about Munich in one single location.
No wonder all of the celebrations take place here and the balcony of the Town Hall is where all the honoured citizens show up and salute the crowd.

A wonderful museum,"You decided to visit Athens and you already saw most of the historical highlights? Why not complete your tour with the best museum in town. Not only are the collections amazing, the building itself is stunning!

Oktoberfest all year long,"For all people coming to Munich, this place is a must. You will enjoy the crowded experience of the Octoberfest all year long, share a laugh or two listening to the Bavarian band in traditional clothes and avoid the food. This is not a place where you will eat if your stomach is not bullet proof.

I am confused,"Well, I don't know what to think about this place. To start, the name is Spanish but the food they serve is Italian. Let's be fair and say straight away that what I ordered was really good. Fresh ingredients, properly cooked, tasty, yes, good food in a very beautiful decor.
But then my friends, comes the show. It looks like they kicked the guitar player and the singers out of an Irish bar for being to loud and making their music unbearable to the drunken English lads roaming around still hung over from the night before!
Again, let me remind you that this place is called Convent and that people going there (or at least I) would expect Spanish music.
Last but not least, note that they will charge you 10€, even if you came to eat, for ruining your fine dinner with loud, poor jukebox music you wouldn't even give 50 cents for if it were a guy on the street playing it...",November 2016,El Convento Del Arte,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d6419487-Reviews-El_Convento_Del_Arte-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0
