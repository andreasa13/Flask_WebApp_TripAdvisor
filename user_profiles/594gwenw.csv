Authentic Bosnian Experience,"Down the street from my daughter's home is a piece of Eastern Europe! Each and every day the Bosnian locals gather to enjoy their coffee or drinks. I had passed it so many times and finally ventured in for a Bosnian coffee and pastry. I was welcomed but found they served only Italian coffee but no pastries. It was delicious! Enjoyed visiting with the bartender and meeting the locals who sat outside daily even if I was looked at a bit sceptically. I try to make a stop each visit, and they always remember me.",June 2020,Caffe Palermo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g44881-d23279001-Reviews-Caffe_Palermo-Saint_Louis_Missouri.html,"Saint Louis, Missouri",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Visited A Dedicated Tree,"A man from my hometown dedicated a tree in my father’s honor at this lovely site by the river.
