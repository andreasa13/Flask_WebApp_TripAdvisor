Excellent food!! Lovely family restaurant,"Had the pleasure of dining at the Bandiera's today. Restaurant is very easy to find via Google maps. The ambience of the restaurant is beautiful. The food is delicious and the staff so friendly and lovely. We got to meet the owner of the restaurant Georgia and her son Dimitri who were so friendly. Dimitri was so informative and helpful with local drink choices.

We took the advice of the lovely waitress Anastasia and ordered the specials starters of baked aubergine, cheese rolls and smoked pork sausages which were all delicious. For mains we had the Beef stifado which was so tender and flavoursome.
We were treated to dessert of chocolate brownie with ice cream, shots of Ouzo and Masthica liqueur by Dimitri. Such an enjoyable evening. Thank you Bandiera. Will definetely return.",July 2020,Bandiera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10445516-Reviews-Bandiera-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Acropolis in the Summer,"We visited the Acropolis today. I was really apprehensive about the visit as we were going as a family with 2 young children who don't do well in the summer heat.
Read up a lot of reviews as wanted our experience to be the best it could be without a guide and decided an early morning visit would best suit us. We picked up the combi tickets of â‚¬30 per adult (the children went free as under 18 and British passports) the previous evening at Hadrian's library. No que which was brilliant.
Got to the Acropolis via the South eastern gate at 9am. Skipped the ticket ques(hurray!!). Walked through the entrance check barriers. Got up the hill and visited all the 8 structures within an hour and 10 minutes, with several little water breaks and several photos at each spot.
By the time We finished and got back down the sun was getting hotter and more people were flowing in.
The climb was easy and the break after each structure made it enjoyable for the children too.
Carry water, hats, sunblock and aim to get there early.",July 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Great food, lovely family run restaurant!!","Stopped here for lunch today after a visit to the Acropolis. We were hot and tired and looking for a light lunch close to the Acropolis. Decided to visit Maiandros after reading reviews and seeing food photos on Google reviews. Glad we decided to come here!!

We were greeted and seated on an outdoor table by a smiling waiter. We had a bottle of alcohol gel on our table for our use. The waiter's were wearing face masks and they kindly turned on their big black fans with watersprays to cool us down.

We ordered the seafood platter of calamari, prawns, white fish, bait, pickled herrings and pickled vegetables served with in-house prepared creamy mayo like flavoured sauce, garlicky cauliflower based sauce and a fava bean mash. Yumm yumm!!. My kids shared a spaghetti Bolognese which was delicious!!

This is a small family run restaurant. We were served by a very friendly and generous Vasilius (the son). Thank you for our complimentary olive oil fried bread served with kalamata olive paste (flavours are so clean and tasty). Our complimentary dessert of freshly chopped green musk melon was so refreshing and thoroughly enjoyed. The icing on the cake was our complimentary shot of Greek liquor. Amazing!!
Thank you Vasilius!! Must visit here if passing by for their food and lovely service!!",July 2020,Maiandros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2315343-Reviews-Maiandros-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Quick satisfying lunch,"Visited Diodos today at lunch time. We used Google maps to get here. 2 mins from monstiraki square. Food and service was good. We tried their grilled octopus, mousakka, grilled onions stuffed with bacon and cheese, pork soulvaki and a Greek salad. Food was good, portion quantities generous.
We were treated to free pannacotta for dessert and complimentary spiced sweet wine. Yummy.",July 2020,Diodos Archaias Agoras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1076890-Reviews-Diodos_Archaias_Agoras-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Good music,"Visited last night. Place is lively, good live music, waiters friendly. Food very good. Ordered skirt steak, red mullet mofongo, beef empanadas all very tasty and flavourful. Children had pizzas which the finished happily. Has to send the cod fish fritter appetizers back as fish wasn't fresh at all and probably spoilt.
All in all a good evening.",August 2016,Platos Restaurant & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2665727-d1046296-Reviews-Platos_Restaurant_Bar-Isla_Verde_Carolina_Puerto_Rico.html,Puerto Rico,restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good fresh food,"Visited for lunch yesterday. Tried their red snapper and mixed seafood mofongo was delicious. My 5 year old had the chicken soup which was delicious very much like how it's made at home.

Fantastic home food.,"Visited here last night with our 2 children 5 year old and 2 year old. The restaurant is a cosy small set up family run. We were greeted and seated by Manuel who was very patient and took the trouble to engage with my children and help us to order the right dishes and wine to go with our meal. We ordered the calamari and clams as starters and shared the seafood cataplana for mains. Annabella cooked our meals to perfection. The children enjoyed the calamari which had a crispy light coating and tender calamari on inside. The loved the clams so much that we had to order another portion to keep the kids satisfied. The flavours of the clams were so simple olive oil garlic and herbs yet so delicious.
All the food is prepared from scratch hence if ordering a cataplana which can take upto 40 mins a couple of starters should easily help kill the time and satisfy the belly. The seafood cataplana was served in a huge pot. It had large tiger prawns, cockles and cod fish wish slices f potato, tomatoes and pepper in a rich flavourful gravy. So delicious. We ordered a portion of bread to dip soak up all the gravy but still had loads left over. Portions are generous. Annabella is an amazing cook and warm person. She was so happy to see the children enjoying her food. For dessert we ordered apple pie. It was yummy too.
So if you are looking for some traditional home cooked fare and are not that fussy about ambience or waiting times this place is a gem.
Thankyou Annabella and Manuel.",March 2016,Aqui Del Rei,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189116-d3978035-Reviews-Aqui_Del_Rei-Faro_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Faro, Portugal",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Fantastic service,"Visited Faz Gastos for dinner on Saturday. The restaurant had a formal ambience. The staff were very courteous and prompt. We had the fixed menu 2 and 3 which comprised of pureed crab in cone pastry, duck, hake fillets on a bed of maize? I think? and creme brulee. My husband had beef medallions, John dory and chocolate dish for dessert. Lemon sorbets were served after fish course to cleanse the palate. Food was ok but not great. I'd say not worth the money. But the service made up for it.
Creme brulee was the best dish of the night.",March 2016,Faz Gostos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189116-d2281835-Reviews-Faz_Gostos-Faro_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Faro, Portugal",restaurants,3.0,4.0
So beautiful,Beautiful cathedral. Views from the top of the tower is breath taking. The steps that lead to the top very steep and can be quite tiring for elderly.

Awesome! !!,"Visited here last night. Staff very kind and attentive. My 5 year old had BBQ pork ribs and relished every bit if it. My husband and myself had the tomhawks. OMG...the biggest steak I've ever seen. And cooked so beautifully. We shared a lovely bottle of red wine from algarve between us. Steak was served with mushrooms, spinach, potato fries and fresh salad.
Dessert was almond and fig cake a bit dense but satisfying. We were busting to the seams by the end of it 100 euros lighter but very worth it!! Deservedly at the top! Well done.",March 2016,Faaron Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189116-d8408933-Reviews-Faaron_Steakhouse-Faro_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Faro, Portugal",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Delicious food,"Visited for lunch today, happened to pass by while walking around the faro cathedral. We ordered the cockles, razor clams, mussels, grilled octopus. Seafood was fresh, flavours clean and food very tasty. Sat outside, the place was busy and staff managed really well smiling and courteous despite my 2 year old leaving the floor in a mess. Sangria was delicious and refreshing. Only the mackerel we ordered was a bit of a let down, possibly our mistake we were expecting grilled mackerel it turned out to be a canned mackerel salad. Nevertheless tasty
A well deserved 4 star.",March 2016,Tertulia Algarvia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189116-d7312087-Reviews-Tertulia_Algarvia-Faro_Faro_District_Algarve.html,"Faro, Portugal",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good food,Amazing cocktails. You can get them at an offer of 2 for 1. Sweet potato fries really good. Goat curry could be better but barbecued pork ribs melt on the mouth. Really enjoy tge food.
