Seriously Overrated,"We have been staying at several NYC hotels in this price range post COVID. This one has a beautiful lobby and especially the bar area (which is closed and preparing to re-open).
We got a deluxe queen room. It was very small and dark. We thought it was an error and we called the receptionist to check. No upholstered chair, just a small desk and hard chair. No move around room. No value here. Can’t compare to several competitive properties. We booked direct to get the best available rate.
Bedding was fine, bathroom was small with a small shower (no tub). It was tiled with a heated floor—a plus.
We can see the attraction fir some visitors seeking character. We will be moving on.",April 2021,The Evelyn Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d99389-Reviews-The_Evelyn_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,3.0,5.0

Locals Found Here,"Just off the Main Street. Locals clearly hang out here either at the bar, the inside tables or on the enclosed large porch area.

Comfortable and Sophisticated,"Opened recently in this well planned and decorated environment. Feeling comfortable on arrival you are warmly greeted and offered a menu that is both classic and creative. The choices are first rate, the service thoughtful and attentive.

Two Visits and Counting,"We visited last month with friends and last night again for a quiet dinner out. We really like the venue, both inside and out on the deck. The inside is spacious, calming and comfortable. The outside deck had vertical space heaters and those diners looked cozy. The marina views add to the vibe. Both of our servers were competent and thoughtful, especially Jay last night. We have now tried several appetizers. The beet salad with oranges is better than most. The meatballs with multiple ingredients and a special sauce and topping were gone before our main courses arrived. The shrimp with linguine was great and the striped bass (caught locally) with fennel etc was even better. We skipped dessert last night since we are aware that a couple of selections come in huge sizes. We hope that this venue stays open over the winter.

Better Than Most,"The first time I called for takeout they politely said they had more orders than they could bake for the rest of the evening. Really? Now I know why. The pizza is great.

Always Seems Crowded for a Reason,"We finally had a chance to have dinner here. It was lots of fun. We got a good welcome and a quick table even though there was a crowd. There are plenty of drinks to choose from, but we settled for beers. The menu is first rate. We started with a triple header—-salsa, cheese and guacamole with chips. This is a great combo. We then had several different tacos—offered in hard or soft shell. One was more tasty than the next. The food is very good, the prices are decent and the crowd validates the ratings.

Found it!!! Great Cuban food in a simple venue.,"We joined local friends here before a theater booking. The venue is simple—no fancy fittings.

Multiple Highlights,The best part of our visit was seeing how many teen aged students came in groups to benefit from the museum’s exhibits and learning opportunities. We also noted how many young people worked for MOCA as guards. The exhibits’ variation added to the quality of our experience. Robert Frank’s much touted series of photographs of “The Americans.” Pattern and Decoration in American Art with fabulous quilts and more. The museum shop was one of the most creative that I have seen.

Trendy With Interesting Design,"A lot about this place feels good, but it has its negative elements. Rooms on the”First Floor” of one pavilion are actually below grade—a truly bad surprise to see the berm outside. We heard hall noises from outside our room and had smokers congregate nearby, making noise and smoke. The rooms are comfortable although not special. The bedding doesn’t match that available in many two star hotels. Rooms are not value priced and even self parking can only be had with a serious fee. My personal conclusion is that this venue is overrated",February 2020,The Garland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32655-d78682-Reviews-The_Garland-Los_Angeles_California.html,"Los Angeles, California",hotels,3.0,4.5
We Want to Clone This Place,"We Want to Recreate This business “back East” but weather won’t permit that. The flow includes an entry room for ordering plus outside tree-covered patios that wrap around 3 sides of the building. There is also indoor seating. Breakfast doesn’t get better than this. Omelettes, pastry, pancakes and more. Great coffees,etc. LA weather makes this place work.

Very Active Bistro,Accommodating venue for a party of two or a group. Although the noise level is noteworthy it is not a problem for a conversation. The menu is quite diverse and French inspired.

Modern Space Ready for the After Work Crowd,"Searching for an upscale place between Grand Central and PENN Station ( & MSG) this place popped up. In a hotel they get an all day clientele.

We shared two quality desserts (key lime tart & carrot cake) that were cleverly done.

Young Crowd,Definitely a popular venue with a party atmosphere and a young crowd. Plenty of fun beverages and a full bar. The food is very good and freshly prepared. Many variants on the standard Mexican fare at other competitive eateries. We tried four different dishes and we were happy with all our choices.

"Really an International Cuisine, with a Mexican Imprint","When you say Mexican restaurant, it does not give the full image for this high level of dining. This is a first rate restaurant with great food and really good service. They like to do guacamole at table side--really good. The menu choices are plentiful and very challenging to narrow down to the selections for a meal. We had fish tacos, fresh fish, duck, etc. The restaurant has two stories, with the upstairs being much larger than the first level. Similar to other good NYC restaurants, this one is pricey but worth it. Recommended. Open 365 days per year and just a stones through from Lincoln Center venues.",December 2019,Rosa Mexicano,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d477523-Reviews-Rosa_Mexicano-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Chinese Food With An Attitude,"This is a good (and some say very good) Upper West Side Chinese restaurant. The food is varied and good. Reasonably priced even. But it now comes with attitude. Christmas Eve sees a high demand for many Chinese restaurants in NYC. Making a reservation we heard that being 5 minutes late we would lose our table. Arriving early, we we warned that those not with us needed to show asap. It felt like new management, but we were told that is not true. The food was fine. The service was less than needed. Drinks were readily offered, but hot tea never showed up. Having visited this location during the year and on Christmas Eve, the food is always fine. As a group, we will move on to another location. We don't need the attitude. As we left, the place was mobbed, with many people waiting for tables.",December 2019,Legend 72,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d5420729-Reviews-Legend_72-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Excellent Meal in a Fine Location,"We were tempted to sit in the outside pavilion for lunch on a sunny day, but it was quite chilly. The compact inner dining area was comfortable. We had a fine meal, ordering a couple of pasta dishes including gnocchi. Taking advantage of our only day in Salerno we added the meatballs. Good wines by the glass.

"Intense Italian Experience, but not Flashy","This modest sized restaurant has tables in the front and back rooms and some crammed in the hallway that passes the kitchen. The place can get noisy when at capacity. There is nothing in the decor that says flashy. It is a basic eatery with authentic, high quality Italian food. The menu has multiple choices and the appetizers and entrees reflect an attention to the Italian tradition. If you are up for dessert, you will find a few, but I was disappointed in the selection. This restaurant has been consistent over the years. It was totally packed on a week night so get a reservation.",December 2019,Mercato,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1898220-Reviews-Mercato-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Avant Guard near Pzza Navona,"A younger crowd hangs here. The food is Italian but unlike any you normally find. We got a fish dish ( well seasoned and decorated ). To accompany my chop we added small roast potatoes and a tomato mozzarella caprese. Good quality, fine service. They easily honored the discount they offered (off season in December) for booking online. We are glad we tried this place.

Real Roman Experience for us,"We stayed near Pzza Navona and walked to the piazza and around it as well. We returned to this venue at #18. (We don’t recall the other location with a similar name). We ordered homemade pasta with pesto and yes, tripe in a tomato sauce. Both great dishes. The waiter said that we would be impressed by the bread to accompany our dishes, and we found it to be a perfect complement to our meal. I tried both the white and the red Sicilian Passivento wines by Barone Montalto. Both of those “house” wines were new to me and a pleasure to drink. My only regret is that I have not seen them in the USA. This venue has outside seating and a cozy interior.

First Rate Boutique Hotel,"For many years it was hard to find a great hotel in Rome. I relied on the TripAdvisor reviews to find this one. The reviews for this property are consistent, which is an important factor in my mind. You can read them and find out all of the things that I could mention. To avoid repetition I would say, its is not just the building (public and private rooms) or the location, but the staff attitude that makes this place really a fine place to stay. Carlo (the morning front desk person) was busy with another guest so his back-up made us feel welcome. Carlo found us a room that was ready for a really early checkin (as happens when you arrive from a cruise that docks early and gets you into the City around 1000 AM). That made such a difference in our one day stay. So, while everyone has their specific needs (normal or quirky) and there might be something lacking for them, I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. I have been going to Rome since 1966 for personal and business reasons. There are surely a few ""better"" hotels that are glitzier or a better story to tell when you return home, but this staff has its A game on everyday and the property is new and comfortable. Even the cappuccino on our departure was a memorable part of the great breakfast. The hotel booked us a perfect ride to the airport at a reasonable rate. Sad to leave.",December 2019,Martis Palace Hotel Rome,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d10061919-Reviews-Martis_Palace_Hotel_Rome-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,5.0,5.0

Just Right,"Not on the street but down a long interior corridor you will find this very comfortable and attractive restaurant. Not overdone, but just right. We were greeted by the owner who let us put together a great meal at lunchtime. We had homemade pasta alla Norma, but named differently. It was excellent. The minestrone was freshly cut vegetables in a semi clear broth. It was great. We shared a perfectly prepared sea bass as a main course and selected spinach as a side dish.

A Special Place,"We attended a family event at another venue, but we needed a pet friendly place and stayed here. It was a pleasure. We got an early checkin so that we could be on time for our event. We stayed in one of the lodges which had 4 units and a view of the water. The room was a mini suite with a sleeping area and another with a sofa and chairs and a gas fireplace. It was first rate--modern, comfortable, totally clean and welcoming. The bath had a large tub and separate shower--plenty of room. The staff was helpful and pleasant. We had a lunch a dinner and a breakfast in the second dining room. The food and service was high quality. The main lodge had restful common areas, including a sitting room and a library with Boston and NYC news papers. The grounds are simply beautiful and located on a sloping hillside with views of the water from many locations. They have ferry board service into town that runs on a regular schedule. The room rates reflect the quality of the place and the fact that it is closed from the end of October until May. I highly recommend this choice.

Reviews Vary Greatly and so do the rates charged,"I had a miserable stay and I couldn't wait to vacate. I relied on prior reviews and I needed a place to stay with a pet. The pet rate at $10 is great. The location is very good. The physical structure of this location is inadequate. In my opinion Wyndham should take its name off the property. The noise level room to room is horrible. You can hear noise from down the hall. Noise from the next room--doors being shut, conversations underway. I was awaken from a sound sleep. People bring lots of children to this place due to their travel needs and probably the indoor pool which was crowded. Lots of good and bad young people noises. The mattress frame did not allow the bed to be flat. The staff was reasonably friendly. There was an effort to keep the place clean, but it didn't feel that way--sticky floor in the room.

Just Pick This Place,"Checks all the boxes—-food, service, price and more. We had lunch on the porch where our dog was allowed to chill out. The inside dining area is great—comfortable, nicely decorated and more. It makes you want to be a local so you can come her often. Enough said.",September 2019,Country Corner Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48661-d899558-Reviews-Country_Corner_Cafe-Southold_North_Fork_Long_Island_New_York.html,"Southold, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Sea Food,One of multiple locations. We sat in the outside patio with our pup beside us on a quiet evening. The sword fish was very good. The flounder was excellent. Both dishes perfectly cooked and accompanied with first rate sides. Two first quality meals. Friendly and competent service. Sorry that we skipped dessert. Highly recommended.

Great Lunch,"Best chicken tacos we have found. A very upscale place with indoor and outdoor seating. Very well managed. Good staff. Extensive menu. Meals outside are near a lovely garden environment and a fireplace for chillier weather. Very close to the Tanger outlet stores and part of the Indigo Hotel, but better than a hotel restaurant.",September 2019,Bistro 72,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48502-d2010657-Reviews-Bistro_72-Riverhead_Long_Island_New_York.html,"Riverhead, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
First Visit Ever,A local legend. Often has very long lines. When you go inside they ask for the next “group.” People go together. Really large parking lot. GREAT ice cream. Very rich butter fat content. Worth the price. Hard to pick a flavor.,September 2019,Snowflake Ice Cream Shoppe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48502-d4616830-Reviews-Snowflake_Ice_Cream_Shoppe-Riverhead_Long_Island_New_York.html,"Riverhead, New York",restaurants,5.0,5.0
It's About The Food,"We found an outside table on a great weekend day. Lots of people watching during lunch. The quinoa salad was first rate. The cheese burger was the first one that I have had in forever that tasted like it came off a charcoal grill--very tasty and moist. I tried the ginger beer which was ""homemade."" Not knowing exactly what to expect I found it a bit bitter, but I soldiered on. The service was adequate, but totally not connected to us as diners. We will return--it is all about the food.",September 2019,Spring Street Natural Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d10431750-Reviews-Spring_Street_Natural_Restaurant-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Very Comfortable,The Maitre’d gets high points for his welcome and accommodation. He made certain that we stayed comfortable. We had perfect weather for outside dining with the view of the neighborhood and Lincoln Center across Broadway. The drinks and wine were great. First rate pate and soup. The salmon was fine and served different ways as requested. The duck was adequate and not special. Great deserts—peach Melba & More. Service was attentive. We look forward to returning.,August 2019,Bar Boulud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1020824-Reviews-Bar_Boulud-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Restaurant Week Dinner,"We wanted a special place for a theater district dinner. The Lambs Club serves its restaurant week menu in the bar and not the restaurant. The “bar” is actually one long flight up from the restaurant. There are numerous tables with seats. The food was excellent. We had the Colorado lamb chops that were great, very good salmon and chicken. Nice starters and desserts. Decent service. Pricey check.",August 2019,The Lambs Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1985959-Reviews-The_Lambs_Club-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Talk It Up,"This restaurant doesn't get enough press. Having been there some years ago, a friend suggested it for lunch this week. It was great. First rate service in a good venue set the ambiance. The food was worth the trip. Excellent soup(s) and main dishes were truly appreciated. Fairly priced, which is not easy to find these days.

Lunch on The River,"On a good weather day this patio is the place to be in New Hope. You can have lunch and dinner out here, which is an expansive, umbrella seating area or dinner inside the charming house closer to the street. There is a long and varied food menu and beverages of all sorts. Service is friendly and prompt. Everyone prefers the tables by the railing close to the river, but there are good views everywhere.

Beer and More,"This is a bright, new space. Really large layout that is well designed with more space than you would expect. Many craft beers on tap for one and all to try.

Great Experience,We had an important business lunch. Quiet space for conversation even with other diners at nearby tables. My colleagues had halibut that they said was some of the best ever. Good achievement for a steak house. They had special Bloody Marys and were happy campers. My meal was fine as well. Our server was especially adept at sensing our mood and needs and was first rate. Appreciated the character and ambiance of the various rooms. Surely will return.,July 2019,Keens Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d425330-Reviews-Keens_Steakhouse-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Consistently Good,"This Mexican restaurant is busy. The negative is the noise level. Lots of people having fun. Always noisy. Good food, good drinks and decent service. Normally a young crowd.

Marked Down For super slow Kitchen,"The service was competent and friendly. The food was quite good—chicken Parmesan, eggplant parmigiana, other chicken dishes, soup and pizza. It would have been a decent experience except the kitchen took forever. We wanted to leave but we toughed it out. Good indoor and outdoor seating.

Really Popular,"Wanting a good coffee and a light breakfast we found RU in Easton on our way north from St Michaels. This place is a buzz. Long line moves quickly. Coffees and drinks and more from the counter inside. Cooked items (think eggs etc) from the food truck outside. Outdoor seating and tons of indoor seating, but most customers seem to want takeout. Surprised no coffee drive thru window possible. . You can watch the roasters when seated inside. Fun experience watching this young crowd start their day.",May 2019,Rise Up Coffee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41121-d3196546-Reviews-Rise_Up_Coffee-Easton_Talbot_County_Maryland.html,"Easton, Maryland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
