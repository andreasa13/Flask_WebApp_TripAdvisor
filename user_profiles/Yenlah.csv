On the fence,"We arrived at the hotel and were welcomed by the front desk staff very politely, they took a €500 prepayment from my partners card and the cost of the room was deducted from the full cost upon checkout. The money took a couple of days to return to the account.

The room is beautiful and was clean on arrival but we had to ask for toothbrush and toothpaste. The cleaners did not come to clean daily, (granted that one of those days we had the do not disturb sign on) meaning our towels and room stayed the same throughout our stay. The 500ml bottle of warm water in the room was only for elite members which seems a little harsh. It's our first stay in a Hyatt and that doesn't give a good impression for no -members who want to become future members. The television constantly either lost signal or just turned itself off altogether in the middle of programs. The internet on the TV doesn't work very well and would not allow us to sign I to Netflix.

There are works going on in the building next door that begin at around 8am every morning, this was very frustrating for us especially as we had no earplugs. The fridge doesn't work very well so don't expect your items to be chilled within 2 hours, also the fridge wasn't actually set up properly (see pictures). The was no kettle in the rom and the staff stated that these were not allowed which was a little strange and infection control wise, this shouldn't really be an issue and if things like this have been altered then guests should be informed.

Breakfast was okay, typical intercontinental spread and the fresh orange juice was lovely. The staff did very well serving all the guests one by one, and everything seemed quite well managed which is not an easy job.

The pool area on the 8th floor was nice (the other pool was closed), but staff didn't seem to be around, or even offer drinks at all. The sun loungers are almost fought for which is typical in Europe anyway but make sure you wear a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen because the heat will torch your skin. The pool isn't too deep, the deep end goes up to 1.5m, and the view of the sky and the city is lovely from the pool area, the only downfall is the construction works on the building right next door which ruins things with not only with the noise, but the builders who seemed to be perving on all the women in their bikini's. The water in the pool is cold which was refreshing from the sun.

The hotel is quite close via taxi to restaurants, the acropolis etc. To walk it is double/triple the time just MAKE SURE YOU TELL THEM TO TURN ON THE METER, they charge an extra 2euros from the hotel due to them being on standby there. The acropolis is a 5-7 euro drive and is €5 including the €2 fee from the hotel and is between €35-40 standard to the airport . The hotel is a really good location in terms of restaurants, the sights and the centre, the only downfall is that the area seems quite run down and there are lots of sex shops/strip clubs right next to the hotel.

I don't know if we would go back to the Hyatt again, it's a nice hotel, it just didn't feel 5 star.",September 2020,Grand Hyatt Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15009871-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
Beautiful but not for the fait hearted,"The ticket office woman was quite rude and unhelpful, she barely answered any questions and just told us to take a picture of the map and the names so that we could basically figure it out for ourselves. We took the path up the metropolis and the sights were breathtaking, it was absolutely beautiful and is worth the uphill walk. You can see the whole city from the top. It is very slippery and rocky so don't make the mistake I made wearing flatform wedges. You need trainers with grip or else you will slip. You have to climb over many rocks and steep slopes, so if you are afraid of heights make sure you have someone to hold your hand. We bought the €30 euro ticket to see all 5 sites which we didn't end up getting to due to the heat (we couldn't hack it lol). It was worth it though the sites are beautiful. I don't want to post pictures and ruin the experience. You need to see it for yourself.",September 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Simply Splendid,"We were greeted by the lovely waiter and seated. We requested Caipirinha's and he made them nice and strong which we loved! The food was phenomenal and definitely great for the price. We had the Greek salad, calamari, seafood risotto and lamb with potatoes. The lamb had around 6-7 pieces for €16 which was great. The food was very fresh and tasted amazing. The waiter was very sweet and attentive, he even brought us a new trial desert to try. Altogether we paid €70 for the whole meal and drinks which was much better than the restaurant ""Spaggos"" that we had been to the day before where we were scammed. You need to try this restaurant, you wont be disappointed!",September 2020,Arcadia Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1501262-Reviews-Arcadia_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Scam artists,"I read the reviews too late or else I wouldn't have bothered coming here. My experience is exactly the same as many others. The ""taxi driver"" took us to the restaurant where he showed us a platter of the catch of the day and talked about being charged in kilos, I asked how many kilos the fish we picked was and he told me that he would need to weigh it and let me know, before I knew it our fish was brought out cooked to the table with no mention of the price, and when the bill came we had to pay €117 for 1 fish, 4 prawns veg and potato.

Then the taxi driver charged us 30 euro for a 20 minute drive at the end, and had the audacity to say that he wouldn't charge us waiting time as he waited outside throughout our WHOLE meal (his decision). I didn't think I would come to Athens and get scammed so badly. I'm very disappointed. Always make sure you ask the taxi drivers to turn on the meter so that you can see exactly what you need to pay!",September 2020,Spaggos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g9609272-d12391297-Reviews-Spaggos-Mikrolimano_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Mikrolimano, Greece",restaurants,1.0,3.0
"Nice, but not clean","We were luckily able to book a room through the NHS scheme which was a really nice thing for the hotel to do. We didn't have much contact with the hotel staff, but when we did they were nice and polite. I went on two separate ocassions and the experience seemed to be different on both dates. During the first experience we did not receive a bath robe, slippers, ear plugs or toothbrushes, but we had brought our own thank goodness. During the second stay we received these items which was nice. The room was beautifully made on both visits however the cleanliness was not great.

On the first occasion I assumed it was a one off and maybe the staff were in a rush, however it was worse on the 2nd visit. The bathroom had clearly not been cleaned properly which was quite disappointing. There were dirty patches on the floor, it appeared as if it hadn't been mopped and the cups by the sink hadn't been cleaned properly. I had taken a video which my partner accidentally deleted.

Nonetheless, I liked the hotel as it is beautiful and is very close to the tower of London and some other beautiful sights if you decide to go for a stroll, the cleanliness was just not up to scratch.",July 2020,Tower Suites by Blue Orchid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d19619544-Reviews-Tower_Suites_by_Blue_Orchid-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.5
Disappointing and expensive,"I always constantly hear about IHOP whilst in the UK so I was really looking forward to trying it but was seriously disappointed. They only had 4 people working on the 4th July meaning that the queues were horrendous, then when I got my food, the hash brown were cold and tasted horrible. The pancakes were not fluffy at all and I had asked for my bacon to be lightly done, but got burnt bacon instead. The lemonade was nice, and so were the syrups but those were pretty much the only things that were positive. Expensive for no reason!",July 2019,IHOP,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60745-d482345-Reviews-IHOP-Boston_Massachusetts.html,"Boston, Massachusetts",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Valentines treat,"The food was quite good. I had the lobster, which I loved! The calamari was okay but the cocktails were quite weak. You couldn't taste the alcohol. Ambience was amazing and the view was nice. Quite expensive which is to be expected.",February 2019,Aqua Shard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d4495284-Reviews-Aqua_Shard-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Not worth the trip,"There were 4 people all attempting to tell the story of Michael half heartedly. 1 of the main singers didn't sound like him in any shape or form. The actual Michael impersonators dance moves were very off and super repetitive. The was a particular dancer with red hair that was constantly either a step ahead or behind of everyone else, in every single performance, and most of the dancer were just repeated. Some of the songs were ruined for me by the way they sang them and the female vocalist was not a good measure; she sings very well but just isn't suited to the show at all. The younger Michael was pretty good and so were the white guy and the bald black guy. The outfits were also well done. I just wish I knew where the Michael impersonator was for most of the show. I was hoping for goosebumps and instead felt like yawning.
