Great stay,"This was an excellent place to stay. Clean rooms, nice bedding, friendly staff, and the free hot breakfast in the morning was just right. I would recommend people stay here rather than a chain hotel. Have a good trip.",February 2020,Holiday Lodge Hotel & Conference Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g59381-d223583-Reviews-Holiday_Lodge_Hotel_Conference_Center-Oak_Hill_West_Virginia.html,"Oak Hill, West Virginia",hotels,5.0,3.5
Must see,A definite must see. We visited Greece on our honeymoon and we voted it in our top three things we did on our trip.

Very beautiful,Very beautiful museum. We were only in Athens for two days and even though it is gorgeous if you have limited time I don’t think it’s a must see- the Acropolis and Temple of Zeus are!,April 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Love this hotel!,"We stayed here for a few days while on our honeymoon in Greece. We were upgraded to the 7th floor suite that had a terrace and sitting room. Phillip the bartender was amazing and introduced us to wonderful Greek beverages (that my husband still talks about) and George the desk concierge gave us the BEST dinner recommendation- a Tapas restaurant a short walk away. Excellent location - easy to get everywhere. Also loved the breakfast every morning. Thank you, gentleman, for taking care of us!",April 2019,Areos Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d1160295-Reviews-Areos_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Deep tissue massages,My husband and I booked massages the first day we got to Santorini. We both enjoy deep tissue. Zoe the masseuse is amazing! One of the best massages I’ve had. I would definitely recommend.,April 2019,Avaton Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635864-d12457983-Reviews-Avaton_Spa-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent affordable Greek food,This was my first moussaka order while in Greece and it did not disappoint! Very tasty. My husband ordered lamb risotto. We were both very happy.,April 2019,Taverna Anestis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635864-d1888290-Reviews-Taverna_Anestis-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
We moved along,We were hoping for a good view while we had dessert and coffee. Sadly we were asked to move when the owner realized we weren’t going to eat a full meal and instead just wanted coffee and desserts. Another couple as well was asked to move. So there were three open tables with a Caldera view but all the sad dessert people weren’t allowed to sit in them. It was off putting. We could tell she wanted us to move along since she never came back to get our dessert order. So we paid for our coffee in cash and left.,April 2019,Lotza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d1802303-Reviews-Lotza-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Lovely terrace,We stopped here for cocktails and dessert while shopping in Oia. Delicious! Would definitely recommend.,April 2019,Melenio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d1550044-Reviews-Melenio-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Pretty cool,"This was very cool. The only thing I would say is without a tour guide it’s hard to imagine/understand what you’re really looking at - even with the signs they had up (which many times assumed you knew which was was north, east, west) still didn’t help with telling you what each structure was. Still, a few cool find and reminder of the history of the island.",April 2019,Akrotiri Archaeological Site,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1189834-d4126654-Reviews-Akrotiri_Archaeological_Site-Akrotiri_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Excellent food,"We went here for lunch on our last day in Santorini. Fira is a great place to shop instead of Oia which is insane with the amount of tourists from the cruise ships. So we stopped in here before getting our family their gifts. I love that the owner, Mario, had pictures to show us of dishes. I was going to order the souvlaki- which I’d been ordering all trip- but he’s pictures swayed me to the Buffalo with red sauce and fried potatoes (great gluten free option!). My husband had the buffalo kebabs and we were both full and happy. Definitely recommend!",April 2019,Tsipouradiko Santorinis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d3580901-Reviews-Tsipouradiko_Santorinis-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
The very best!,"We loved staying here. First of all, excellent communication - I received an email from them before our stay to see if they could help with shuttle arrangements from the airport. When we got to the airport there was an excellent driver with a sign and our name. He took us straight to the hotel and a wonderful man carried our luggage for us (there are some steps- worth it!!) to reception where we met the owner, Loukkas. He gave us some tips and tricks. Another man at reception, Chris, did a Great job setting us up with reservations, taxis, directions, and tips. We started off our vacation with massages at a spa down the street. There is not a room with a bad view. Every morning breakfast is delivered to your patio. I would tell every friend to stay here. My only feedback would be the beds are really hard so if the wonderful owner sees this maybe start to replace the mattresses one by one in the next few years. Thank you so much for making our honeymoon lovely!",April 2019,Vallais Villa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d623814-Reviews-Vallais_Villa-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Sadly the only bad meal we had,"Sadly, this was the only bad meal we had while on our honeymoon. I mean, we actually have talked about it being one of the worst meals we’ve ever had. I feel bad saying it but there were lip stick stains on my wine glass, even though a table freed up and we were waiting at the bar we had to ask to seat ourselves, the bartender could only pour beer and wine - no fun cocktails! Even though they had all the makings :( the food was undercooked or badly seasoned. I had the chicken and shrimp and my husband had the grilled shrimp with vegetables. We even remarked that it smelled bad. Sorry!!!",April 2019,Posidonia Greek Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189433-d12367379-Reviews-Posidonia_Greek_Tavern-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,1.0,4.5
Great little dessert place,"We went here after a day of shopping in Fira. Delicious coffee, gelato, and chocolate! I ordered a macaroon and the salted caramel gelato and was happy to eat it back at our hotel in the hot tub with a glass of wine.",April 2019,Confetti Dessert Boutique,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635864-d14236597-Reviews-Confetti_Dessert_Boutique-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Delicious,We enjoyed this restaurant on our first night in Santorini. They have an excellent sommelier that paired the chicken I order with a tasty wine. My only feedback is I felt it was a tad overpriced. We had food that was more delicious at other local more affordable places. But you are also paying for excellent service and THE VIEW!,April 2019,The Athenian House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635864-d10285840-Reviews-The_Athenian_House-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Our favorite part of Santorini!,This was our favorite part of our stay in Santorini. So worth it!!!

Imerovigli must,"If you are staying in Imerovigli this restaurant is a must. I had the pork shank (which was incredible) and my husband had the roast beef.
