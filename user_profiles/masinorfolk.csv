Great Place to Stay,"We were made very welcome on arrival. We arrived early and our room wasn’t yet available, so were offered the room on the ground floor, which was idea. Situated in the city centre and turn right out of the hotel and 20 second walk to the main via indipendenza, which has all the well know shops plus loads of places to eat. Walk straight on and you come to several interesting buildings.Turn left from the hotel and at the bottom of the road is a supermarket for anyone like me who likes to snack on something in the evenings. Most attractions are in walking distance. The staff at the hotel and very friendly and every request is dealt with efficiently and with a smile. It was cold when we visited this February but the hotel temperature was very comfortable. The room was clean and even had a kettle, which made me very happy.. Breakfast was continental, with plenty of choice. I have looked at some of the negative reviews and find them all very strange. Yes there is a Lingerie shop next door but I did not see anything offensive and also most of Bologna is covered with graffiti. The road is narrow but very safe.",February 2019,Il Canale Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187801-d296969-Reviews-Il_Canale_Hotel-Bologna_Province_of_Bologna_Emilia_Romagna.html,"Bologna, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
