Great location. Great friendly/quick,"Great location. Great friendly/quick service. Not expensive especially considering the location. Mixed fish fish very impressive.

Nice little family run bar,Nice little family run bar surrounded by bars and restaurants. They don’t do full dinner service in the evening but they do have Cornish pasties (to die for!) and sausage rolls in the eve. But it’s manly a bar. They have a TV outside and football is always on.

Loved this place. Stop looking for restaurants and go to this one!,"Loved this place. Great service. Was friendly (seemed mainly English) and efficient. Tables spread apart (COVID). Great menu del dia. I had nachos, then crispy duck pancakes followed by the green curry. All had so much flavour! Oh, and I may have also had the baileys ice cream dessert, but only cos it was included! Would have it all again.

They have got this right.,"They have got this right. Aircon (unusual in this part of spain) or an outside terrace. Airy. Big. Clean. Good atmos. Lots of staff (all British), so you’re never waiting long. The Sunday roast is better than most I’ve had in London. ALL the trimmings. Swimming in gravy. The cod and chips is huge (there’s a mini special which is still more than enough!). It tastes great and comes with tartar sauce. Not expensive (roast is 7.50€ and a pint of HopHouse13 or Heineken is 3€).

Great location on the beach.,"Great location on the beach. Lots of parking if you get there early. They get very busy for lunch as menu is good. BUT staff are very rude. No interaction. Stand around chatting by the door and impossible to get their attention. Wait ages for the bill once you do. They set up for lunch at 11am and if you haven’t booked a table you have no chance of even sitting down for a quick beer even if the table isn’t booked til 2pm.

Has potential but couldn’t get served so left,"It was in November so out of season. Maybe 20 people in the bar. I sat outside, like most, but following being given the menu, I waited 20 minutes to find a waiter to get served. Couldn’t. So gave up and left. Food and drinks were expensive anyway. It’s a nice little secluded location on a somewhat unimpressive stretch of beach. And in the middle of nowhere. You have to drive or walk miles like I did to get there.

Great fun afternoon tour of the outskirts of Prague,"Firstly, note you have to take a tram for 7 stops to collect your segways. So don’t expect to tour the city on one of these things as they are banned.
We opted for the 3 hour tour, which end to end lasted over 4 hours. Which was great. This included a large beer at the oldest ministry in Prague. Just over £50.
We had Anezka as our guide and she was brilliant. Great fun. Knowledgeable. Spoke great English. Wasn’t boring. Chatted to us a lot.
We had some great views of Prague from the hills surrounding the city. Lots of time spent on the segways but with plenty of rest stops to see the sights.

They do have a few sporting memorabilia, but not enough to spend more than 20 minutes nosing around.

Absolutely brilliant!,"If you’re reading this cos you’re sceptical of an all inclusive in turkey, don’t be! This resort is fantastic. The staff, the pools, the food, the entertainment, the beer! All excellent.
This was my first all inclusive / package holiday for 15 years. And we are looking to go back next year.

From the moment we arrived, checkin was quick, smooth, efficient and an entire coach load was sorted and in bed within minutes. Sabri was in charge of this process and he and his staff couldn’t have run a smoother process. Above and beyond for sure.

The main pool was a good size with a couple of proper slides for the kids. The other pools were scattered around the large resort. A baby pool. A toddlers pool. A relaxation pool. An indoor pool. Whatever you wanted.

We didn’t spend much time on the beach cos the facilities were so good by the pool. But if you’re a beach person, you have everything you need. Sunbeds. Shade. Towels. Water sports. Sea!

There are bars and fridges with bottles of water everywhere. So you can’t get thirsty. You never have to wait to be served. Always lots of staff who are friendly, quick and efficient. Lots of cocktails to pick from.

Evening entertainment was definitely aimed at the kids. Surprisingly it didn’t finish til 11pm (way past the adults bed time!). But always something different to keep them entertained.

Food was the best bit. The buffet was plentiful and great quality. They mixed it up every evening and had different themes (Chinese, local, international) and there was something for even the fussiest eater. The lunch buffet was by the pool and was open from 11.30 til late afternoon.

If you fancy venturing out the resort, there’s a village of about a dozen shops (selling fake cloths), a couple of small supermarkets and about half a dozen restaurants. It’s about 20 minute walk (don’t let anyone tell you it’s less!) or a 3 minute taxi for a couple of pounds.

Great food, facilities, staff, rooms, entertainment, pools and everything was clean/spotless. What more can you be looking for?

Well done team! See you next year.",May 2019,TUI BLUE Tropical,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g663346-d619821-Reviews-TUI_BLUE_Tropical-Sarigerme_Mugla_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Sarigerme, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5
Perfect location. Very friendly service,"This hotel is all about the location. It’s on the river in the heart of the main set of restaurants and bars along the east side of the river.
It’s a 3 min walk to the Dom (cathedral) and to the main shopping area.

The 2 guys that were there over the weekend were brilliant. Very friendly and helpful.

Room was small but comfy. Didn’t spend much time in there so didn’t matter.

The only negative is the noise from the bars below. I had one of the quietest rooms and it felt like the DJ and his speakers were in my room. They do finish by midnight. So best of joining them then going to bed.

Typical german brewery house,"This is typical of 100s of german brewery houses across the county. This one is close to the Dom and has a nice seating area outside.

Service is very typical of one of these places. And old man in while overalls throwing beer and food at you from a distance ensuring he hasn’t smiled for at least 50 years.

Food is more expensive then the other options close by and mass produced. 2€ for 2 mouthful of beer with a typical german head that’s half the glass.

Great zoo and loads of room for the animals,"Love a zoo and this one didn’t disappoint. Loads of room for most the animals.

I went when it opened at 9.15 just after it opened and most the animals were still shut away for the night. They gradually were let out. Had to wait til 10.30 got the elephants to be let out.

Suggest you go at 11ish. All the animals are out then and about to be fed from 11.30 onwards. The sea lions being fed are definitely worth a watch. Impressive.

Not bad for a free walking tour,"I dumped my bag at the hotel and went and did the tour straight away.

30 people was far too many for a tour with no headsets. In some of the busier areas you couldn’t hear what he was saying.

It was a bit too scripted for me. I’ve been on these before where they reel off facts but it doesn’t sound scripted. This did.

Was informative and he didn’t keep going on about the fact it was ‘free’ and he only works on tips. Money wasn’t even mentioned til the very end when he passed round a hat. So that was good.

Nice facility. Needs between signage,"Previous comments have mentioned this but all the signs are in german and none in English. So it’s impossible for a tourist to find their way. I went 3 times and each time I accidentally found a brand new area I hadn’t known about the time before. They give you a map, but it doesn’t show how to get to the areas.

It’s also difficult to know which areas you where a swim suit and which you don’t. A lot of it you have to be naked. Some parts you are not allowed to be naked. Just copy everyone else!

Be careful going into the Dead Sea floatation pool as you have to pay 5€ every time you go in there. That’s on top of the extra 5€ you pay to get into that sauna area. And this isn’t explained on entry. They tried charging me 33€. I got it back down to 20€ after complaining.

The actual pools are lively. Inside and out. Pools, sitting pools, whirl pools, hot tubs, saunas, steam rooms. Loads of areas.

1 hour cruise - don’t bother,"To be honest, I’m not sure they can do much about this as there’s only about a few hundred meters of the bank to see. As cologne is very small and all in one area (where to boat leaves from).

This seemed more about making money from selling you drinks onboard that about anything else.

You went 20 mins right. Turned round. 30 mins back. 10 mins back to pier. A recording spoke every 10 minutes about cologne in general.

Find somewhere else,"Well I stupidly ignored the other comments on this site and took a gamble. Which didn’t pay off.
The only positive I can say about this hotel is the location. It couldn’t be better. And that’s why I picked it. It’s 2 mins from the main square.
The customer service was 1 star, if that, as per the comments below. The staff in Reception couldn’t care less. They were not interested in the fact the bathroom smelt like sewage, or that a dozen kids were causing havoc of the floor or I was, or even that the door lock was broken and didn’t lock.
The hotel is old, tired, needs a make over and new staff to manage and run it.
Walls are paper thin. So you can hear every conversation and at least 3 other TVs at once. Plus the noise from outside is loud. There’s a cafe/bar opposite that had a lock-in Saturday nite. Was still going (with loud music) at 10am Sunday.

Can’t decide on its purpose,"It’s quite a way from the city centre and a bit random. 15€ to get up there seems steep and I wouldn’t pay it again. You’re so far from the city you can’t really much out. Although you are right next to a modern football stadium and something called Euroland.
Lots of steps inside. 80 up. 127 down. This is as well as the lift and escalators. Not instead of. So beware if you’re not fit!

We had Pete. A Liverpudlian (think he said he was a big Beatles fan and a big reds fan). He had lived there for 7+ years and was very interesting and knew the city well. And it’s history. He didn’t make a big thing about the money. Just mentioned at the start and at the end. They expect 10/15€ pp which is fair.
Last 2.5 hours and plenty of time for pics and questions. Plus you stop at Scott’s for a beer/hot chocolate half way through for 20 mins. Which is handy to warm up on a cold day!

Good hotel. Spa access let them down,"I stay in hotels a lot. And one thing I enjoy at the end of the day is a dip in the pool. So usually select a hotel that has one. All too often a European hotel will let them-self down but charging extra for these facilities.
15€ for 90 minutes here. Not even per 24 hour. Or per day. Plus a hat is mandatory @ 3€ and flip flops at 4€. So that’s 22€ for a quick dip in a pool. Ridicules.
That unless you come here in the summer. The. Your be very happy. The rooftop pool and bar are stunning. Very well designed and looks high quality. The views across the salt lakes are beautiful.
The hotel itself is obviously fairly new. The rooms are clean, modern and huge beds, a desk, TV, built in wardrobe with safe, nice art work of the lake on the wall and a good size.
The bathroom is one of the nicest I’ve seen. And done to a high quality. The only annoying thing is the extractor fan never stops. So if you’re a light sleeper, bring ear plugs or you have no chance.
The location is ok if you have a car and won’t be drinking. Nowhere is walkable. There is a ‘sports bar’ on the ground floor. But they only have Spanish channels. So no English football or rugby. Just a few small TVs up on the walls. They also have a small selection of tapas. Amstel on draft and a few bottled beers. Plus the usual selection of spirits. No atmosphere though. Very quiet.

Free zoo all year round and lots of space for the animals,"Love this zoo. I’ve been a number of times and will keep going back.
The animals seems happy. Although in the winter the apes/monkeys seems a bit bored as they weren’t allowed outside.
Lots of variety. Tigers. Polar bears. Giraffes. Monkeys. Apes. Birds. Snakes. Spiders. Penguins. Sea lions. Seals. Etc.
Great views of the city from here too.

Great location. Comfortable room. Good facilities,"This is a Club Quarters Hotel so comes with the usual communal lounge to chill out or work in. Has a coffee machine with good latte (real beans!) as well as a normal one in your room.
Unlimited M&Ms (always a bonus), mixed savoury snacks, nuts, wasabi snacks, dried bananas and seeds. Plus fresh fruit. They also put our cereal bars in the morning and nachos & salsa in the evenings. So nice added touch.
Room was big enough and comfortable. Clean bathroom plus a desk and chair in the room. Not a lot of draw space (2) but a shelf in the wardrobe top.
Iron and iron board available along with extra bedding in the communal closet.
Filtered water stations with bottles on every floor. So you save a fortune in bottle water. Which is handy.
Location is south of the river directly opposite the Trump Building. So you’re 2 mins from the loop and 5 mins from Magnificent mile. 10 mins to the Bean. You couldn’t be in a better location.
They also have a usual hotel gym, laundrette (which is free!) and a few computers for public use. You can also WiFi print including your boarding pass for free.
All in all it lives up to CQ standards. Will stay here again.",January 2018,River Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35805-d250023-Reviews-River_Hotel-Chicago_Illinois.html,"Chicago, Illinois",hotels,4.0,4.0
Perfect for a lunch time snack,"Big reputation considering it’s a hot dog place. But it’s simple and tasty. Especially if you don’t want the typical American ‘meal’ and you just want something to get you by. They also do sides like onion rings (which were nice) plus the standard burgers and that.
They serve alcohol so no getting away from a lunch time beer.
In the summer there’s queues out the door. In Winter you don’t wait more than 10 minutes.
This place is also good as it’s one of the few places you don’t have to tip. You line up. Order and pay. Then your number is called. Grab a table. So fast food (and they are quick).

They are so inefficient it’s just not worth it,"So this is the 3rs time I’ve been up there and probably the 6th I’ve tried. Even in Winter the queues are horrendous. Last year we even queued up outside for 45 minutes when it was -15C. Then got inside and it was another 2.5 hour queue. When you get up there it seems empty. And they don’t tell you the queue time until you’ve bought your ticket. That is unless you ask and they are reluctant to provide the information.
This week the lifts were closed for maintenance for a few weeks. Meaning they used another lift. The queue time for 2 hours of you had a city pass. And 4+ hours if you didn’t. So many people trying to sell on their tickets as they bought them without knowing. It’s not fair.

"Good menu, nice atmosphere, easy dining","Went with family for NYE.
There’s something on the menu for everyone and it’s always a nice atmosphere in there. Good decor. And upstairs and a downstairs with nice seating.
Took us a while to order drinks and then took over 20 minutes to get them. Which was surprising as Service is normally quite good there. Wasn’t overly busy either.
The cheesy garlic bread was good and the fish pie was very good. Lots of fish and didn’t taste like it was from the freezer.
I’ve also been there for breakfast before and also enjoyed it.

Very good 3 star hotel,"Not sure how this isn’t a 4 Star. But the location was great. Was 5 mins walk to Alexanderplatz which was very handy.
Bedrooms were small but comfy.
The breakfast was very good. Buffet and you could have a dry up, fruit, meats and cheeses and all the usual. Plus you could make your own waffles. And add all the unhealthy toppings you like. And the coffee wasn’t bad either for a machine.
Nice reception area and they had drinks and snacks if you wanted to pay and take to your room. Also a reasonably priced bar. But why would you drink there when you’re that close to the centre.
Was disappointed I paid extra per night for ‘city views’ as we didn’t get that. We even moved rooms twice (initially j asked for a high room and we got the first floor!) and ended up on the top floor, but had zero view (as per the pic). So I would say don’t pay extra for a view as you won’t get one.

Good atmosphere. Good food. Rude service,"We went for the Christmas markets and had a great time. Our hotel was one block over so this place was handy and had the reputation.
Atmosphere was really good. The band were very German, in dress and music. Lots of people dancing.
Food was a basic menu. Typical to what you would expect for a place like this. But the food was very good and big portions.
The only complaint was twice we had rude servers. Not just rude to us but everyone they came across. Literally threw the food and drink at you and if you didn’t know what you wanted when asked, then they weren’t happy. Yes they were busy, but the service was very abrupt and sometimes pretty rude.
We went back Cos the food and atmos. Oh and the steins! The beer was very good. But I wouldn’t take a date or my parents to such a place. So except Service will be bad.

"Friendly service, nice sports bar, basic rooms","New hotel in Portsmouth. I usually stay at the Marriott but this was recommended by a friend so gave it a go.
Very friendly checkin. The ladies they have on Reception are very polite and organised.
We had to move rooms twice. Once because of the noise from the gym and the second Cos of the noise from the studio.
They have accepted they have major issues here. You can here it on all 5 sleeping floors. I ended up at the top and we could still here the music from the classes. But it wasn’t as bad as on the second floor (gym/studios on Floor 1). It was as if we were in a nightclub.
Rooms are basic. Wardrobe is a open hanger (like in an Ibis). Not a lot of room to walk round the bed. Small single Desk.
It does have a nice long size double bed with a hug TV that has sky (not sports).
In the club room you get a coffee machine and water. And free access to the gym and pool. Not if you have a basic room you have to pay a fiver per day per person for these facilities. So be aware!
Pool is small but nice. Hot tub is very small and not hot. No proper jets. And you have to get out for 6 mins every 6 mins when the jets stop. They are on a cycle and you get kicked out when they stop. Which is very annoying. Sauna and steamroom also available. Oh and note you have to walk down quite a few stairs to get to be pool facilities from the changing room. So not great for older people. Nice changing rooms though and lockers.
There’s a Starbucks on site. Which is very handy.
And they have a really nice sports bar with a couple of huge screens. And offers while the live football is on. Not bad food either. But not Cheap.
Have stayed here again since. And will again. But it’s basic with a few nice extras.",December 2017,Village Hotel Portsmouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186298-d12822637-Reviews-Village_Hotel_Portsmouth-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Good Sunday roast, poor service","Had a Sunday roast there today.
Took 10 mins to flag down the waitress just to get a food menu.
Despite pork being listed as an option online, there was only beef, lamb and chicken.
We had a sharing starter but weren’t given side plates. Yet again took a while to flag someone down to get some.
We then waited another 25 minutes after the starter for the main course (following a chase up).
There was no follow up on how the meal was or if we wanted another drink.
We were then presented with a check with 12.5% service fee included. I asked for this to be removed and that took the manager and a number of questions to get it removed.
Food wasn’t bad. Our main issue was with the service. Everything was chased and an effort.

Good for a couple of hours of tasting beer,"This was definitely more about beer tasting than a tour of the brewery, but that’s exactly what we wanted, was good.
Ashley was our host and she was very enthusiastic and friendly. Very knowledgable on the beers and interacted with the group really well.
We tasted 5 beers and they were happy to top up if we were empty.
She made it fun rather than just stating lots of facts about beer.
The brewery tour itself was the final 25 minutes after everyone was ‘merry’. Educational and interesting.
We ate and drank at the bar after and food was excellent. So was the service. We had the meaty sharing plate. Was big and filling.
Would definitely go back again.

Everything was perfect!,"I stayed here mid-August as I had arrange a surprise weekend away for my parents for mothers Retirement. I booked 4 rooms. All of them had something special. Either the view, the size of the bedroom or the size of the bathroom.
The staff were fantastic. They kept the surprises for me, they managed the payment situation exactly as I had instructed, they were always on hand when you needed them, but never in way.
The grounds are simply stunning. The back lawn and the ponds are beautiful. Including the outdoor pool area which is perfectly sheltered and kept at 30C! So wasn't cold at all. We spent the best part of the day by the pool and the service (sandwiches and drinks by the pool served all day) were great.
The indoor pool was always nice, although not quite as warm as the outdoor pool. Nice and relaxed and next to the Snooker room.
The breakfast was very good. Order off the menu a full fry up, Omelette, eggs benedict, Salmon, muffins etc, but a full buffet of cereals, fruits, juices etc etc.

Wouldn't revisit but ok,"This hotel had rebranded in 2015 so that's why there's not many reviews I'm guessing.
On check in I was offered an upgraded room with a balcony as part of my Expedia Gold membership although she said there were no room available for night 1 but I could swap night 2. Unfortunately when I went to ask the next day I was told they had already double booked 4 of those room types so I couldn't move.
I was also asked for my credit card for incidentals. But after swapping it I was informed of the 28 bucks a night resort fee which meant I could use the pool table (I was alone) the swimming pool, jacuzzi, sunbeds by the pool and by the beach. I really hate these fees in some hotels. It's a con. U pay for the hotel, then you have to pay to park, then you have to pay local taxes, then you have to pay a resort free. You end up nearly doubling the cost if your stay!
The room has a nice layout however you need to roll up a towel and place it under the door as the air con makes such a loud whistling noise coming under the door its the only thing you car hear while in the room. Reception told me that was normal and the case in 80% of their rooms. The towel was the answer.
2 bottles of water were supplied most days (they forgot 2 of the days) which is handy.
2 of the days they forgot to give me towels. And on one of those occasions it took 3 phone calls and an escalation to the manager to get some after an hour of chasing.
They only replaced the shampoo twice out out 7 nights. So all in all housekeeping wasn't great.
The jacuzzi is hidden but make sure you find it as it's a decent size although it's hit and miss to whether it's hot that day or not. It's also got a lot of chlorine in.
I didn't use the pool as the hotel blocked the sun as of 14.00. So it was in the shade and cold.
The best asset for the hotel and one that wasn't well advertised is the fact the hotel provides sunbeds on the beach. Which is very very handy. Although once again there's a hidden free. If you want an umbrella it's an extra 20 bucks. If you want a big lounger it's 75 bucks and they really do try and push these.
Location wise it's kind of in the middle of mid beach and south beach. So it's a 20 minute walk to the start of Ocean Drive and all the bars and restaurants. On the plus side it's only 5 minutes to the beach.

Not good service and bill was wrong,"We walked into this place and said we wanted dinner. We were sat at a pub table and thrown a couple of menus. It wasn't until my friend went to the bathroom he discovered the restaurant out back. So we asked if we could move. It was as if I had asked for gold cutlery. But we were seated in a corner out the way.
The server took our order and I emphasised what we wanted as it was similar and he didn't write it down. He repeated it back to me correctly and I said at the time I bet I don't get the lamb burger cooked as we've asked.
Which was the case. It was brought out wrong and he said that's what I had asked for. He did end up taking it back and it was cooked for longer, but by then my friend was nearly finished his meal. So I had to eat alone.
I was offered a free coffee but at 22.00 that wasn't going to happen.
Then when we received the bill the price of the food and the drink were both incorrect and the server tried to tell me it was tax. But the tax was added later on the bill. In the end he made a big deal of it and took it to his manger to discount the difference.
The reason I gave 2 stars in stead of 1 is the burger wasn't actually too bad....in the end.
Lots of options. Go somewhere else. This is a bar that is trying to also be a restaurant.",February 2017,The Front Page Restaurant & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g28970-d481212-Reviews-The_Front_Page_Restaurant_Grill-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",restaurants,2.0,3.5
Dragging the Hyatt name down,"Wouldn't stay here again.
Checkin took 25 mins as there was only 1 person serving and a number of people waiting to check in. The guy that checked me in had a sports t-shirt on which I wouldn't expect in a Hyatt Regency hotel.
The buffet Breakfast voucher wasn't offered even though it was paid for. I had to force the issue.

After I had checked in, I requested some non-feathered pillows. It took over 40 minutes to get them. And that was after a chaser phone call. Then I was brought 2 more feathered pillows before I got the right ones.

The hotel will push for you to use their car park. But street parking is free until 8am and then it's very cheap thereafter.

The room layout is bad. The TV is parallel to the bed. So unless you turn the TV and hang half way off the dresser, you can't see it from bed.
The coffee machine was dirty and had to be properly cleaned out before we could use it.

At breakfast the next morning we were informed they weren't doing buffet Breakfast that day. Instead we were allowed to choose one thing from the menu. I wasn't happy as we had a voucher for the buffet. Which is obviously a very different kind of breakfast than having to pick eggs or an omelette or other. I expressed my unhappiness but we were left to pick one thing. I then asked for orange juice and my friend asked for coffee and juice. We told we could be charged for anything more than the one menu option and one drink. And was also told I would be charged if I wanted toast.
I kicked up a fuss and in the end we were given the extra drink and toast at no extra cost.
I would expect a lot more from a Hyatt Regency Hotel.
