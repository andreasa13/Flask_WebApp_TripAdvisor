Very nice dinner,"Came down during sunday peak time. The line was pretty huge but that couldnt be helped. The Carver looked happy, always greeting everyone asking how they are.

Vegetables were constantly being changed so all of it was piping hot. Floor staff done a great job! Quick and efficient.",January 2020,Stonehouse Pizza & Carvery Royal George,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1576811-d3163342-Reviews-Stonehouse_Pizza_Carvery_Royal_George-Shoreham_by_Sea_West_Sussex_England.html,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.0
Lovely place,"When you visit the place, you're not going to spend a lot of time here. You can take water in but any other drinks the guy will stop you. First, he told us no drinks then changed his mind a couple of minuets later. There was a sports day going on with school, doing all sorts of activities. Which took up the whole center part of the stadium.

At the back right, you can go through the tunnel and read a little history about the torches and that. It's not bad for 5 euros.",October 2019,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
It's just amazing how intact it is,"It's crazy to see how intact the temple is. It's such a lovely building to look at, looking at all the details is just amazing! The walk around and near the temple as well is so nice. Few places to sit down and take a little break and there are shows inside. You can't go inside though, it's all fenced off.",October 2019,Temple of Hephaestus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1064133-Reviews-Temple_of_Hephaestus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Things could be better,"The place inside is great, large area 2 small bars. There were tables everywhere without a dance floor which was strange. No one could really dance as there were so many tables everywhere. Normally everyone would join together but instead everyone kinda just sat down and bopped their head to the music.

The music was good, mainly English house music with a couple of Greek house I'm guessing. Smoking is allowed in here which for any non-smokers means you're gonna get 'smoked' out literally.

The entrance fee was around 10 euro but you get 1 drink with that which is nice. The ratio of the drinks here is 50/50 (50% alcohol and then 50% mixer).

Around 2 am is when the main event starts and you get all the dancers up on poles and the stage. Which is great to watch, again as there is no dance floor it's not like you can join in anywhere.

You can make reservations for tables which is recommended purely because there are so many, you get water and 1 litre of alcohol. For a table of 3, 1 litre of Gin was around 95 euros.

We went on a Friday and a Saturday night, Saturday night was so packed and they kept bringing people in. Because you reserve space at the bar you're basically pushed off and there is nowhere to move. Maybe a little better management required here.

Again if you're in the area visit this place!",October 2019,Lohan Nightclub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d11827483-Reviews-Lohan_Nightclub-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Must visit!,"You must visit this place, you can get a ticket for around 30 euros which I highly recommend getting because it will save you money in the long run.

"Short Stay, Away from the tourist area","I and a couple of friends stayed at McQueen for a total of 5 days. We arrived before the time you can check-in to get your key. But they immediately said it was fine to check-in earlier which was great!

The Hotel is absolutely immaculate. We never had one problem with anything to do with cleaning. When the maid cleaned our room. Toilets were bleached (which is the first I've seen). Everything replenished. One of my friends left money in a bag while she was cleaning. Luckily she saw it and kept it safe for her! While it was a large amount every cent was still in there.

The staff is extremely friendly. I can't single out one of them because everytime we saw them they were always happy. Helping out with any problem we had. It cost us around 65 euros from the airport to the hotel. But the receptionist said we could get one of McQueen's private transfers for just 50 euro!

The hotel isn't near any of the areas you might plan to see; The Acropolis, Hadrian's Library among many others. But we used the app BEAT for taxis and it costs anywhere between 3 euros to 7 euros. Which is extremely good. Their rate starts off at around 1.30/40 euro.

I must recommend that you go and visit the temple of Poseidon. I can't stress this enough. We went for the evening time to watch the sunset and none of us were disappointed. It was such a lovely sight to behold.

There are bars and clubs about a 10minuet walk away from the hotel so if that's your scene I recommend Lohan. Your drinks are gave to you in a 50/50 ration. So be mindful of that.

Overall there isn't anything I can say about improving this hotel. It's a lovely place to stay if you're in athens.",October 2019,Mc Queen Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d2244724-Reviews-Mc_Queen_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Love it,"Love having a takeaway from Thai Star, it's always arrived piping hot and very tasty. Everything is seasoned nicely. Price wise is acceptable. Portion sizes are also decent.",February 2019,Thai Star Takeaway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1576811-d8527484-Reviews-Thai_Star_Takeaway-Shoreham_by_Sea_West_Sussex_England.html,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Not the best experience,"Booked a table for 9 people. We all waited around an hour and a half for the food, while someone else waited longer just for the fried fish. The people who had a roast said it was really good. They enjoyed it. My Dad and I had a beef stroganoff which was very bland no taste to it, we finished our meals before the finished serving everyone else.

The place is very clean and has a great interior. The waitresses were 'okay' one of them asked if another waitress could take our order for some reason.

Desserts also took around half an hour to come out as well. We all thought that there was only one person in the kitchen, which seems silly. But the waitress would spend a fair amount of time in there helping out.

In total, we were there for just under 3 hours, for 9 mains and 9 desserts it's not the best.",March 2019,Beach Green Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g504224-d2482612-Reviews-Beach_Green_Hotel-Lancing_West_Sussex_England.html,"Lancing, United Kingdom",hotels,2.0,4.0
