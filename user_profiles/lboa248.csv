Worst experience ever!,"Visited the Acropolis this evening (because of the heat in the afternoon) with my sister and her 3 little boys. All very excited to see the Acropolis. We bought our tickets at 19:15 but we were not told that you have to start leaving the highest point at 19:50.

We start walking assuming we would have enough time. After 10 minutes a lady tells us we have to walk faster and when we reached the top we were told we had to walk immediately back downstairs.

The way the people were asked to go downstairs was not friendly. It was quite aggressive. The people were treated like cattle and I really couldn't believe my eyes. We had to walk so near to each other because they wanted everybody out at 20:00 o'clock. Walking with so many people so near to each other not taking into account that there is the corona virus.

The stairs are quite slippery and my sister got nervous because of the workers yelling at the people. She fell off the stairs with her 2 year old son in het arms. My nephew of 6 years old also fell off the stairs and the same happened to a man walking behind us.

So I paid 20 euros to go through a gate to be told they will close and then to be treated I a way that was far from human.

Tip 1: tell the people you're closing at 19:50 if they enter after 18:30

Tip 2: find another way to get everybody out of the Akropolis at 20:00.",August 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,1.0,4.5

Amazing food!,"Sometimes you find a place and everything is just perfect. We were in Edinburgh for the weekend and wanted to eat something traditional.

We had the menu du chef with 4 dishes. So the menu was going to be a surprise.

I didn't feel like leaving at that moment so I didn't pick up the bill. 5 minutes later she comes to our table and she says that the bill has to be paid now.

Organic and delicious!,"Location is great ( Omotesando neighbourhood) but we passed it 2 times because it is on the 3rd floor. It is above the shop Nest Robe.

We got good home made bread. We asked for olive oil to dip it in. My husband and I shared 3 dishes. Gnocchi cheese, pasta with vegetables, steak with vegetables. They were all very good!",September 2015,Natural Food Restaurant Nr Table Omotesando,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066456-d6066382-Reviews-Natural_Food_Restaurant_Nr_Table_Omotesando-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Shibuya, Japan",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Average restaurant,"Noisy small place.
Meat was good but to expensive for what you get.
Tables are not comfortable.
One of the waiters was very kind.

They put an amuse on the table at the beginning but don't mention you have to pay for it. Not a nice surprise when you get the bill.",September 2015,Rrr Bistro Kobebeef & Wine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14129735-d4724671-Reviews-Rrr_Bistro_Kobebeef_Wine-Roppongi_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Roppongi, Japan",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Western bread and pastries,"Good quality of bread. I wanted a simple baguette with cheese and salad. It was not on the menu but they still made it for me.

Maybe the tea was a little expensive $5..

Good atmosphere.",September 2015,Paul Roppongi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14129735-d2086593-Reviews-Paul_Roppongi-Roppongi_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Roppongi, Japan",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Nothing special,"Line of 1 hour waiting outside. I expected something special.

The waitresses were kind. Had a nice table on the terras.

The food was nothing special. Tasteless omelette. Potatoes were like made in a school cafeteria. Juices were not fresh.",September 2015,Eggs 'n Things Harajuku,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066456-d3584055-Reviews-Eggs_n_Things_Harajuku-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Shibuya, Japan",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Good food,"Had a red curry with chicken. It was good but not like the ones you get in Thailand.

Waitresses were kind. Good atmosphere in the restaurant.
Location is in a side street so you have to know about the place.",September 2015,Jasmin Thai Roppongi Honten,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14129735-d10646633-Reviews-Jasmin_Thai_Roppongi_Honten-Roppongi_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Roppongi, Japan",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Just WOW!,"My husband had the sandwich with avocado, harisse, lettuce, scrambled eggs, tomato and salad. I had 4 pancakes on each other. On top coconut sauce, macademia and roasted coconut flake. All just perfect.

The orange juice was served in a real orange with a straw. I prefer a glass.

Nice area to walk around.",September 2015,Eggcellent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14129735-d6652714-Reviews-Eggcellent-Roppongi_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Roppongi, Japan",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Average restaurant,"Everything was a little bit average.
The service was not unfriendly but it felt like the atmosphere was not good.
I had a risotto parmesan cheese. It was good.

Very touristic place.

Very good view at the terrace. You are looking at the rainbow bridge",September 2015,TO THE HERBS Aqua city Odaiba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14134368-d1661538-Reviews-TO_THE_HERBS_Aqua_city_Odaiba-Daiba_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Daiba, Japan",restaurants,3.0,3.5
