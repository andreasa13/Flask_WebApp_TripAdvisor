Nice course,It’s a 5 for a 90s player like me. A bit challenging but fun and in good shape. My preference in the area.,February 2020,The Champions Club at Summerfield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34657-d2414486-Reviews-The_Champions_Club_at_Summerfield-Stuart_Florida.html,"Stuart, Florida",attractions,4.0,4.0
Excellent selection,"Great pizza in Florida from a Bronx boy. Thin crust well done - or however you like it! Great assortment of toppings - and gluten free options, like cauliflower crust. Try it.",February 2020,Nick & Johnny's Osteria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34334-d11699117-Reviews-Nick_Johnny_s_Osteria-Juno_Beach_Florida.html,"Juno Beach, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Very good local food,"Take reservations( made it 2 days in advance- very popular), honored the time tho very busy, good food, busy place. Would recommend it as a restaurant choice in Imerovigli.",October 2019,Anogi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635864-d2090736-Reviews-Anogi-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Can’t say enough,"If you are looking for a quiet, peaceful get away, this is it. In between Oia and Fira (a good, no-nonsense hike to either if you like to walk) - none of the crowds. Restaurant was good and reasonable. Breakfast was good and enjoyed outdoors. We were there the 3rd week of September. No sunset crowds here! Enjoy them from the comfort of the pool/deck/restaurant area. It is not a large hotel. The service is personal and informative and warm - can’t say enough about Christos and Yannis (who patiently helped our children arrange a catamaran trip for us). We upgraded to the honeymoon suite with private patio facing west to the caldera. Glad we did, but it is easy to just walk to the pool area to enjoy the pool and/or sunset from east facing accommodations.",September 2019,Xenones Filotera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d278898-Reviews-Xenones_Filotera-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
"If you want a small boutique hotel in the wall of Diocletian's Palace, this is it","Great location inside Diocletian's Palace, great staff (very helpful and personable), breakfast menu options available, walking distance to ferries, small, intimate experience (fewer than 10 rooms). We were there the very beginning of October.",October 2019,Heritage Hotel Antique Split,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295370-d6947960-Reviews-Heritage_Hotel_Antique_Split-Split_Split_Dalmatia_County_Dalmatia.html,"Split, Croatia",hotels,5.0,5.0
Great adjunct to the Acropolis visit,Glad we did it as the exhibits further explain and complement the history and what one experiences in the actual Acropolis park visit.,September 2019,New Acropolis Museum and Acropolis of Athens Skip-The-Line Small Group Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d15341044-New_Acropolis_Museum_and_Acropolis_of_Athens_Skip_The_Line_Small_Group_Tour-Athens.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,4.0,5.0
Glad we went,"Athens as a tourist destination for us was never high on the list. But we are glad we experienced this historical marvel. We were there in late September - it was still hot and crowded(but manageable) - I can only imagine what the summer high season must be like! It is a sizable park with a moderate to slightly strenuous walk to the Parthenon at the top - but many places to stop and rest and take photos along the way. Do it if a stop in Athens can fit your travel plans. Also go in the through the Dionysius Gate as opposed to the main gate (less crowded). Beyond the Acropolis, we also enjoyed the market section and the Electra Rooftop Garden restaurant with a great view of the Acropolis at night.",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Very Nice venue, food and view of the Acropolis at night","Made a reservation (recommended); had dinner and a bottle of wine; impressive view of the Acropolis lit up at night; a little on the expensive side, but the food was good and worth the special al fresco ambiance",September 2019,Electra Roof Garden Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2587968-Reviews-Electra_Roof_Garden_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Successful and Fun and Educational Day,"Besides the weather being perfect, Nate the captain tracked the whales while our expert guide, Tray, educated us, made us laugh and made sure all were relaxed and having fun.

Passing through Vasto,"What a fortunate find to round out a wonderful (albeit short) stay in Vasto. It is all about seafood!! Wonderful family owners, personal attention, well appointed, comfortable atmosphere and great seafood. We valued the friendliness of the owners as much as the quality of the seafood, both of which were terrific.

Special,"Nicola and Cesare and the staff make you feel like you are special and go out of their way for you to have a rich experience not only at the hotel but in the entire area.

Charles Bridge,"A must see in Prague. It is interesting in its own right and connects 2 historic parts of a city that boasts beautiful architecture, lots of charm and which was largely untouched from the ravages of World War 2.",September 2013,Charles Bridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d275157-Reviews-Charles_Bridge-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",attractions,4.0,4.5
Like Staying with Family,"This is a beautiful boutique hotel within walking distance of everything. In addition to the well designed and well appointed rooms and common spaces (the atriumed lobby is like a piazza where residents gather to share the events of the day), the personal attention one receives from the ever-attentive staff is beyond expectation. The breakfasts were also very good and substantial. It is truly like staying with family. If you value personal, comfortable service and if you can, end your trip in At Residence Agnes in Prague as the level of personalized service is very likely to be downhill from there.
