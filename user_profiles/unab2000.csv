Really Good Irish Pub in Belgium.,"Really Good Irish Pub in Belgium. Normally I stay away from Irish Pubs when abroad but this is clean, spaceous, beautiful food and access to matches. Perfect for just a bite at lunch nice dinner and they have live music and alcohol with a nice crowd in the evenings if your into that. Restaurant is great",January 2021,Kitty O'Shea's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d694683-Reviews-Kitty_O_Shea_s-Brussels.html,"Brussels, Belgium",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Amazing experience,"Two things: If youve any walking mobility issues there are definite areas which appear that they cannot
be accessed but overall it is amazing for views and iconic ruins. Wear comfortable shoes. Being water and maybe a hat if too hot. We went Nov 2019 cant imagine doing this in height of summer! it was hot enough in november",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Fun night out,Technically was here November 2019. We were planning to go to Lohan across the road but between costs and being denied entry because you had to book online headed to tokyo instead. It saved a good night. Great show music. Bouncer was superaccommodating and we got free drink for 10 euro entry. It was packed that night but Greek people were so nice and friendly. Was an amazing experience as a tourist. Would highly recommend.,January 2020,Tokyo Theater,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d13166627-Reviews-Tokyo_Theater-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,3.5

One night in heaven,"I stayed here for a splash of luxury and that is what it was. Food was great, gardens are stunning, slept really well and breakfast was lovely. The spa is gorgeous but I would suggest wearing flip flops as floor was wet and slippy. otherwise it was a fab stay.",February 2020,Carton House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g315875-d598117-Reviews-Carton_House-Maynooth_County_Kildare.html,"Maynooth, Ireland",hotels,5.0,4.0
Great,it has a really central location with night life nearby. theres the tram to the airport around the corner. there are large rooms which are very comfortable and breakfast was nice although rooms could use more plugs in them and it was a bit stuffy from heating at night. overall perfect for our stay but lots of steps for people if theu had mobility issues.,October 2019,Castle View Guest House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186525-d274039-Reviews-Castle_View_Guest_House-Edinburgh_Scotland.html,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
