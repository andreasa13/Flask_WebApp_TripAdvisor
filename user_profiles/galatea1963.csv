Delicious food great sunset view,Great food . The summer salad and the summer chicken fillet were our favorites . Lovely for a quiet dinner with spectacular sunset views . The service was excellent and it was not expensive,October 2019,Pirouni,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635607-d1891153-Reviews-Pirouni-Firostefani_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful Villa located in the heart of Santorini,"The villa is located in Imerovegli, close to Fira , a well known town in Santorini. It takes about 20 min to get to Fira on foot from the Villa
Our room had a balcony ( see pictures below)
The room is small but there are larger suites available. There is a pool ( did not get to use it)
Close by there is a hill you can climb up and get spectacular sunset views
I would definitely stay at the same spot if i went back to Santorini
You need about 4 days in Santorini if you want to do a cruise to the volcanoe, which, unfortunately, we did not get to do",October 2019,Krokos Villas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635864-d1027577-Reviews-Krokos_Villas-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Not to be missed if you like archeology,"Delos is an island that is currently uninhabited and mainly an archeological site . You don’t stay there , the only people that stay on the island are workers . You can get to it by Ferry from the island of Mykonos .
It’s an ancient beautiful site . The guides are terrific .
My guide’s name was Athena ( yes , like the goddess) extremely knowledgeable since she is an archeologist
It takes about 4 hours to tour the island . Take hiking shoes since there is a nice hike uphill that gives you a fantastic view .",October 2019,Archaeological Site of Delos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g202339-d4297568-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Delos-Delos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Delos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Majestic,"Breathtaking
I only put daytime pictures because the night time ones don’t do it any justice
Would definitely take a guided tour
You will learn a lot and it will enhance your experience",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great location / best breakfast / great rooftop views,"I liked the hotel . The staff was very helpful and polite . It is a boutique hotel. Some rooms have a view of the Acropolis, so make sure you ask for that
The rooms are small . Some hace SEPARATE TWIN BEDS . So make sure you request one queen/king bed if you are traveling with your significant other .
Very close to the Acropolis and the Monastiraki flee market and Plaza
The breakfast was spectacular and they start serving it at around 3 am in case you are leaving early for a tour .
The last 2 pictures are from the roof top bar",October 2019,Athens Center Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d1453555-Reviews-Athens_Center_Square-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Not crowded , Beautiful, plenty of time to take poctures","Read this before you book a slot canyon tour

Great company, wonderful Navajo guides excellent service
First of all, if you want to make the best out of this area, do not book the tour from Vegas . Go to Page, Az
Page is located about 4 hours from Vegas and about 2 hours from Flagstaff. If you book your tour from Vegas you will spend most of the day traveling and only an hour in the canyon ..... not my idea of a tour
Go to the Navajo website and book the tour directly from there .
I picked this company because they offer a variety of tours, and they promise small groups I first took the combined slot canyon and Horseshoe Bend . It is 2 and a half hours long . You leave from their office and you go to the canyon on an open vehicle . Beautiful ride . Then you get to spend about an hour in the canyon JUST WITH YOUR GROUP of less than 15 people . So you have plenty of time to take pictures like the ones you see below.
After that you go to Horseshoe Bend and have about 30-40 minutes to explore and take pictures . Our guide was a lot of fun and took some great pics with our phones .
I got back to their office at 2:30, had time to eat and then left at 4 pm for a sunset Tour of Alstrom Point . It takes about an hour and a half to get there and you stay there till sunset taking as many pics as you want .
You are back by 8 pm
This company provides great service , they are punctual , polite and give you enough time to see everything
PERFECT TRIP",April 2019,Horseshoe Bend Slot Canyon Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60834-d12188623-Reviews-Horseshoe_Bend_Slot_Canyon_Tours-Page_Arizona.html,"Page, Arizona",attractions,5.0,5.0
Simply delicious,"It is a must if you visit T or C
They are open from 7 am to 3 pm
If you are a quiche lover , like I am, get there early to get your pick among their assortment of scrumptious ones.
Delicious coffee , an assortment of teas wholesome food and delicious pastries .
Decorated with paintings by T or C artists ,it is a favorite spot for tourists and locals .
Thank you for keeping the passion alive",July 2017,Passion Pie Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47241-d3190796-Reviews-Passion_Pie_Cafe-Truth_or_Consequences_Sierra_County_New_Mexico.html,"Truth or Consequences, New Mexico",restaurants,5.0,4.5

I highly recommend this company
