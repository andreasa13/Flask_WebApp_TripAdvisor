Acropolis,Our tour with Olive Sea Travel included the Acropolis. The steps up were a bit slippery for me butit was worth the climb.

Awesome Hotel,"I just came back to this hotel after more than four months away and they not only remembered me but the manager and several staff members (Jeff, Marlon, Eric, and Carolina to name a few but not all) greeted me by name. The service is fantastic, all of the staff are friendly and service oriented, both bartenders (Briana and Patricia) are superb, and the hotel is extremely well maintained. There is nowhere else I would want to stay in this area.",September 2012,Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton - Miami Brickell Downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34438-d2253238-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_by_Hilton_Miami_Brickell_Downtown-Miami_Florida.html,"Miami, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.5
Awesome hotel - great service and ambiance,"The Brickell Hampton is truly a great hotel. It is an upscale Hampton with tastefully decorated rooms and awesome service. The front desk staff could not be more friendly or helpful. The bartender is great and the prices are truly reasonable. The hotel is convieniently located near shopping, restaurants, business and recreation. I cannot think of anything more I would want. I have stayed in this hotel a total of four times now and am returning for another stay next week.",May 2012,Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton - Miami Brickell Downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34438-d2253238-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_by_Hilton_Miami_Brickell_Downtown-Miami_Florida.html,"Miami, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.5
