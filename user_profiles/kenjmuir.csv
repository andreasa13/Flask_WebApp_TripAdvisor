Over priced- paying for the view of the Parramatta River,"We had a small family celebration
Service was good and the menu looked appealing BUT
the barramundi was soggy
while the boerworst was tasty it was certainly undersized
the chicken was very average
Fortunately the porl\k belly entree was very good
We passed up the opportunity on the limited offer of expensive deserts and went around the corner

Excellent food and service at great price,"We requested a booking for a Friday night and were fitted in. The restaurant was busy for dine in and take away. The service was slick and courteous. We chose Pad Cha Fish and scallops and Sizzling Seafood with 2 serves of rice accompanied by a whole coconut. WOW there was a lot of food for 2 people and it was delicious.

Flight inclusive holiday packages are NOT recommended and check your itinerary,"We went on a 22 day Classical Greece and Turkey tour. Both countries are great. I love the way itineraries are qualified with a statement that the itinerary is subject to change.
Inspiring Vacations sold us a holiday package flights included. They subcontract out the actual touring. That’s OK but only if the subcontractor is given the itinerary. 2 contactors were used Travel Zone for Greece and FEZ for Turkey. Travel Zone did a good job with hotel vouchers and transportation. FEZ was magnificent with a very knowledgeable guide AND sorted out the parts of the tour that were not passed on to FEZ by Inspiring Vacations.
The original itinerary listed hotels but that list turned out to be pretty flexible. Sure the quality of accommodation was good but if you rely on the listing for emergency contacts while travelling you are in trouble.
Being locked into a fly and tour package is foolish because you have no time to overcome jet lab before starting the tour and you therefore cannot really assimilate or value everything on the first day. It also means that there is no real space and time to relax and shop at the end of the tour. The cost of changing flights is exorbitant. We recommend that you arrange your own flights.",August 2019,Inspiring Vacations,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d17560866-Reviews-Inspiring_Vacations-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,3.0,3.5

Go early to try to avoid the heat and crowds but there will be crowds. Carry water. its hard to get clear photos because of the visitors so just marvel at the structures and views.
We were knocked over by the number of people who had not bothered to do a bit of reading before visiting and even met someone who had no, yes NO, idea that the Acropolis was a main attraction in Athens.

Sable Sands is a Great place!!! Booked Batoka Safaris as part of 6 day VIC FALLS HWANGE LODGE SAFARI.,". A great camp location and accommodation. Meals were excellent and the ambient was incredible. On the arrival afternoon game drive we saw tsessebe, silverback jackals, warthogs, elephants the sunset visit by a herd of elephants and a fantastic dinner made the day. Our hosts were thoughtful enough to provide guests with polar fleece ponchos to cut down the chill factor when on game drives. Not much luck in Hwange the next day due to the cold but this was rectified by another herd at dusk and again a superb dinner. Great hosts.
I hope to revisit in 2020

Tremisana Logdge is a great place to stay and an excellent stepping stone for Orpen gate and lower Central Kruger,"Booked through African Budget Safaris as part of a VIVA Safari 4 day Kruger Lodge package. The evening game drive at Tremisana and the next day walking tour and drive helped set a high level of expectation because we saw hippos, elephant, silverback jackals, steenbok, impala and kudu. Accommodation and meals were of a high quality. The drive to and from Kruger’s Orpen gate in an open game vehicle was freezing and sadly lacked any thought of client comfort. Winter in South Africa is cold but being in the back of an elevated open bakkie at 80kph of 40 minutes each way is freezing! The game drive was lucky as we started with wild dogs. We were told that they were unlikely to be in the park, but this proved otherwise. As we thawed out, the luck continued with our Guide Patrick helping to find sightings of the big five and a black rhino plus hyena, hippos, silver back jackals, bushbuck, banded mongoose, Lichenstein’s hartebeest, tsessebe, kudu, impala, and steenbok.

We enjoed it and it is a good stepping stone for Central Kruger.",July 2019,Tremisana Game Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g471855-d1158411-Reviews-Tremisana_Game_Lodge-Balule_Nature_Reserve_Kruger_National_Park.html,"Balule Nature Reserve, South Africa",hotels,5.0,4.5
Overall a good service but on some flights the attendants provided poor service,We went on a Classical Greece and Turkey tour flying with Emirates. The flight booking support was great! The inflight service depends on the mood of the staff. Food was good on all flights as was the check in service. Flying to Dubai 22 July EK0415 and on to Athens EK0103 the attendants did a really good job but the return flight EK0414 on14 Aug left a fair bit of room for improvement.

Amazing Food and Service with a wonderful night view of Istanbul,We arrived in Istanbul around 2000 on Friday. The area immediate around our hotel did not have many restaurants so we sought out the Momento as recommended by our Fez Guide.

Meals were inexpensive with a good range of local food. The service well the service was fantastic. Aydin catered for our every need. He was attentive but not intrusive.

She was so impressed that we took our youngest as a 21 birthday treat. Seeing at dawn, morning or afternoon is spectacular. Go back and enjoy it. The now $10 park entraance fee is well worth it. I have stayed at various hotels- Vic Falls, Azambesi and Rainbow and all provide excellent access to the NP Don't miss this and if you have the cash the flight over the falls Angels of Bonisair are bonuses.

Marc's Treehouse is a good idea BUT get the plumbing fixed and better cooks,"Our stay at Marc’s Tree Camp was overall disappointing. Due to a minor mix up we used 3 different treehouses and in each the hot water showers were terrible but easily fixed by some simple maintenance. Our daughter burnt herself from the dripping hot water shower tap. Both dinners were poor quality. This is supposedly a 3-star accommodation permanent camp but given our later experience with accommodation with 3-star ratings we think the rating is not justified. The Treehouse camp has potential, but we were unable to experience the features that have attracted praise. Arriving late and departing early for game drives or the morning walking safari meant that we could not enjoy the vista offered from the treehouses. The saving grace was the early morning bushwalk, the daily incursion of a small herd of Nyala into the locale and to the waterhole near the breakfast area each morning.
I would recommend that Marc’s Treehouse do some elementary plumbing to shower fittings and put some effort into dinner. Unless this happens, I would recommend using other accommodation near Kruger.",July 2018,Marc's Treehouse Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312618-d1644841-Reviews-Marc_s_Treehouse_Lodge-Kruger_National_Park.html,"Kruger National Park, South Africa",hotels,2.0,4.5

Note. The road to the Mara is under reconstruction by a Chinese consortium. Rather than rebuild in piecemeal fashion they chose to dig up all of the road. It is a mess! We did not see more than 30 workers on the whole of the 40 km reconstruction and they were no ding much. We look forward to travelling on the finished road.
Enkorok Mara Camp was very pleasant with excellent smorgasbord dinner, huge breakfast choice and great packed lunch that helped us spend an uninterrupted day on a game drive that caught part of the migration as well lots of game – lions, cheetahs, warthogs, elephants, impala, zebra, wildebeest, hippos, ostrich, jackals, hyena, buffalo, giraffe, impala, Coke’s hartebeest, kudu, steenbok,

Great place to stay but no Flamingoes,"Booked as part of an Asili Adventure 10 day Marsai Mara Serengetti Lodge Safari, we travelled to Lake Nakuru. The lake was a bit of a disappointment because we had hoped for lesser flamingos but because the lake has extended there is no feeding for them and so they are absent. The edge of the lake has grown by at least 200m since the 80’s and what was the foreshore is submerged and the tree line fringe is now part of the lake. This means that in parts the park is very narrow vegetation is concentrated making it difficult to spot game.
