"Great food, great location","We ate here on a Wednesday evening and had a fantastic meal. The food was excellent and the service was great, and great menu. A bit more expensive than some places we ate, but worth it for something a little bit more special.

Great place for lunch after Ancient Agora,"This was a really nice place for lunch after the Ancient Agora, or the Roman Agora. Nice and quiet. A bit off the beaten track. We visited on Tuesday mid October during covid, so it was quiet, but they didn't seem over excited to see us, but the service was good and they seemed happier once we started ordering food (there were 4 of us ).

Brilliant,"We visited on a Wednesday morning mid October during covid restrictions. We were the first ones in. They gave us a guide to explain a number of the exhibits and encourage us to get hands on with them.

A must do,"We visited on a Tuesday morning mid October during covid restrictions. Only one of the 3 entrances were open - the most northern one, not far from the Monastiraki metro station. It's free with the 30 euro pass and well worth the visit. It's a large site with lots of ruins, some in varying states of disrepair. The Stoa of Attalos is the main attraction.

Interesting neighbourhood,We visited on a Tuesday afternoon mid October during covid. We followed a self guided tour from the DK Athens guide book.

Fantastic monument,"This is included in the Acropolis admission. We visited on a Monday morning mid October during covid restrictions. It wasn't very busy, but we had to wear a mask whilst at the top of the Acropolis and follow a one way system, which was fine. There was plenty of space so people could explore at there own pace.
Personally, I prefered the Erechtheion to the Parthenon. Seems more elegant, more romantic.

Peaceful in the middle of a busy city,"We spent 5 days in Athens in October during covid, and walked through the park at least 3 times, usually on the way somewhere.

Worth a visit,"We were on our way to the museum of ancient Greek technology and stopped off here to see the tomb of the unknown soldier and see the changing of the guards. It was a Wednesday morning mid October during covid and wasn't very busy. Personally I think watching the changing of the guards at the Presidential palace was better.

Interesting,"This is an octagonal tower that has carvings on the outside depicting the various winds and housed a water clock, but there was no explanation about what the clock looked like or how it worked.

Not much to look at,"We had the 30 euro pass so this was free. Mildly interesting but not a great deal of information. Other sites were very good with info boards.

Amazing,"I would recommend watching the changing of the guard at the Presidential palace rather than the Syntagma square.

They had all the processes in place to stay safe from a covid perspective. They were welcoming and friendly. The roof top restaurant is fantastic - great food, great service and great view of the Parthenon. The location is perfect as well.

immaculate,"This temple is part of the Ancient Agora. It's well worth a visit, especially if you have the 30 Euro tourist ticket.

Fantastic,"We visited the Acropolis on a monday morning during covid19 restrictions.

awesome,"We went to the Parthenon on a Monday morning, during covid19 restrictions. Buy the 30euro ticket and enter at the entrance nearest the Acropolis metro station.

Friendly efficient Transfer from Athens Airport,"I booked this transfer from Athens airport to a hotel near the Acropolis partly because the flight left the UK at 6.45 am, so we would've been tired, and partly to avoid public transport due to Covid19. Ioannis was ready and waiting when we arrived at Athens and was friendly and polite. He also gave us a commentary about the sites to see and what to look out for. He even taught us some Greek and recommended some Greek dishes to try! Very professional.

Scary Mystery,"This saturday morning, we completed the 'Nerve Klinik' at Break Escape in Loughborough. We've done 'sands of time' and 'boiling point' before, so knew the sort of thing to expect, but the twist with this room is that there was an actor in the room too. Ally was our host and did a fantastic job building the tension before we went in and providing help if we needed it. The room is designed for over 16s, as there's a bit of a horror theme. There's no real danger, and you know the actor won't hurt you, but there is a lot of tension! We completed the task as a group of 4 and had a great time. Would highly recommend it. Ally did a great job. He hosted us for 'Boiling Point' as well, a few months ago. There are 2 more rooms for us to try, so we'll be back soon!",November 2019,Break Escape,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190776-d11697871-Reviews-Break_Escape-Loughborough_Leicestershire_England.html,"Loughborough, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
Fantastic,"We had a fantastic day under ground on the hero extreme trip. There were 5 of us, so we did the trip in slightly less than 6 hours. Our leaders were Jason and Janine, who were both brilliant. The minimum age is 14 and my daughter is 16 and managed easily.
We met up at 9.30 and then walked to the kit room, up a steep track through the middle of a disused slate mine, so a bit loose under foot, so you need trainers. They provide Wellington boots and all safety kit. You have to provide gloves and a packed lunch and drink. Wear something you don't mind getting wet or dirty, although everything we wore was as good as new after being washed. You work reasonably hard and it's 10 degrees C under ground, so you don't need lots of clothes. We had T-shirt and a summer jacket. You will wear a harness, so if you want anything to hand, like a camera, you will need chest pockets. Oh, and you'll need the smallest rucksack that you can get away with for your packed lunch. You stop for a break after a few hours to have lunch.
It's not cheap (£79 per person) but we had a great experience so we think it's worth it. I would definitely recommend it if you are in the area.",September 2019,Go Below Underground Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186447-d2097486-Reviews-Go_Below_Underground_Adventures-Betws_y_Coed_Snowdonia_National_Park_North_Wales_.html,"Betws-y-Coed, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great family challenge,"We walked up the Ranger path and down the Rhyd Ddu path. Both are staight forward -we were novices but reasonably fit. Our youngest person was 15. We parked across the road from the YHA (details are on the website) £6 for all day. We each had a rucksack with food and clothes, although we had more gear than we needed and ended up taking clothing off on the way up as it is hard work. We started at 8.30 and reached the top at around 11.30 without pushing it and having a couple of stops for drink and food. All the paths obviously converge at the top so it was quite crowded. We went up on an early September Saturday so mid week would be less crowded. We hang around the top for almost an hour having more drink and food. The top is about 10°C cooler than the bottom so can be chilly. We had flasks of hot chocolate which was great. You can buy food at the top but it was rammed - we took all our own food and drink. Coming down the Rhyd Ddu path was staight forward. It also took about 3 hours including a couple of stops. At the bottom, to get back to the car park, you can take a bus, a steam train or walk. The bus runs once every 2 hours. We missed it so walked. It took us about half an hour, but is flat. There's no pavement.

Then 'the French Experience', 'Tank Men' and 'Battlegroup Afghanistan' are fascinating. The main exhibit is second world war tanks and there's really too much to see in a day and take it all in.

Lovely beach,"We spent the day at middle beach on a Wednesday during the school holidays. The beach is narrow so there's not masses of space, but the bay is sheltered and the water shallow so it's great for swimming. Further along the beach at Knoll it was very busy, but I think I would recommend parking st the Knoll car park and heading left when you get to the beach to avoid the crowds. You can then also explore the sand dunes.
When we went, the ferry wasn't working (it's expected to be out of action until November 2019) so that may be why the beach was quieter nearer the ferry.
Parking was £4 for 4 hours, or £9 all day. Free for National Trust members. There's a few NT places around do may be worth being a member.",August 2019,Studland beach and Nature Reserve,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551718-d2165496-Reviews-Studland_beach_and_Nature_Reserve-Studland_Swanage_Isle_of_Purbeck_Dorset_England.html,"Studland, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice steam railway,"£60 for 4 adults. Park at Norden for £3.50 all day. Stop at Corfe castle to look around that then continue to Swanage for lunch. The whole journey is about 20 minutes, so £15 per person is a bit steep.",August 2019,Swanage Railway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186266-d1455784-Reviews-Swanage_Railway-Swanage_Isle_of_Purbeck_Dorset_England.html,"Swanage, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great lunch,"It's a short walk from the castle entrance, but far enough to avoid most of the crowds. They had a lovely beer garden, where we had burgers and cider. Lovely food in a peaceful setting!",August 2019,The Fox Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551710-d1881555-Reviews-The_Fox_Inn-Corfe_Castle_Isle_of_Purbeck_Dorset_England.html,"Corfe Castle, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Interesting castle in a great setting,"We parked in the NT car park (£2 for 2 hours or £4 for 4 hours) and then walked 10 minutes to the castle. It cost £60 for 4 adults. The castle was interesting but had been demolished the civil war, so there wasn't a whole lot to look at. We spent about an hour going around the castle, so was a bit over priced for what it was. With hind site, we should have parked at Norden, £3.50 all day, got the train to Corfe for the castle, then continued to Swanage for lunch, and join the National Trust.",August 2019,Corfe Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g551710-d261348-Reviews-Corfe_Castle-Corfe_Castle_Isle_of_Purbeck_Dorset_England.html,"Corfe Castle, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5
Bit expensive,"We turned up on a Sunday evening around 6.30 and got a table for 6 without a booking. The food was good and the menu a bit more interesting than some of the other restaurants in the area. However, it's a bit expensive. It cost £200.",August 2019,Las Iguanas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186298-d1393098-Reviews-Las_Iguanas-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good shopping centre,There's a wide choice of shops and restaurants at this shopping centre.

Very interesting,"We visited HMS Warrior on a Sunday morning in August during the summer holidays. We probably started around 10.30. It took us about an hour and a half to go round the ship. We had a leaflet to explain areas of interest around the ship, and there were people dotted around to add some more insight, which were very good. There is no set route around the ship, like there is around Victory or Mary Rose, so it's a bit random as you explore the ship.",August 2019,HMS Warrior 1860,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186298-d547821-Reviews-HMS_Warrior_1860-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Really interesting,"4 of us, 2 parents and 2 adult children, went round HMS Victory on a Sunday morning whilst spending the day at the Historic Docks. We went in at around 11.30 and there were no queues. We came out about an hour and a half later and there were lots of queues, so get there early to avoid the crowds. The audio is very good, and the route is well organised so you can take your time or scoot round quickly. Dotted around there were a number of people in character who were very knowledgeable and helpful if you had any questions. If you're spending time at the Docks, going round the Victory is a must.",August 2019,HMS Victory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186298-d4354338-Reviews-HMS_Victory-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great day out,"We bought the all in ticket as we were in Portsmouth for 3 days, so would be able to go back if we wanted. We visited the warrior and the victory before lunch and then the submarine museum and harbour cruise after lunch. That was long enough for one day. There is plenty to do at the Historic Docks so although the all in ticket isn't cheap, it's actually good value, unless you're only there for one day. Note that the Mary Rose is on a separate ticket.",August 2019,Portsmouth Historic Dockyard,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186298-d269087-Reviews-Portsmouth_Historic_Dockyard-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Average,"We were 4 adults having an early evening meal on a Monday. We had whitebait, pitta bread and humous for starter and battered haddock and chips and sticky glazed pork for main. For dessert we had pavlova, chocolate tart and cheese board. Food was okay but nothing special. The chips were a bit soggy. All in the meal cost £120 which seemed a bit steep.",August 2019,Abarbistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186298-d1913178-Reviews-Abarbistro-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5
