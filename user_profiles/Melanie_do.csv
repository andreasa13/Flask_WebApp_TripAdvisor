Easy Thai restaurant,"Madame Shawn has several restaurants in Paris. Specialties are Thai food. Prices are average, menu has a lot of choice and food is tasty. Service is OK, but make sure to book in advance. The places are usually very small and crowded.
It’s a nice option if you want to eat Thai, but also nothing very special.",November 2019,Madame Shawn Bistrot Thai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d3327810-Reviews-Madame_Shawn_Bistrot_Thai-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,3.0,3.5

The best guided tour in Athens.,"I hesitated to pay a ticket to go there, but I really don’t regret it! An audio guide is provided, and it really makes the difference.

Dont miss it!,"The temple is located in the ancient agora and it is the temple that is the best preserved. The entry is included in the 30€ pass giving access to several highlights.

Traveling back in time,I was so impressed by The site. It is really a must see. I went on a Monday around 8:30am. Timing was perfect. No line and very little people there so I could enjoy the space.

Nice little restaurant near the market,"Hopped in on a Sunday afternoon and took the Armenian kebab with a beer for 11€.
Small desert was on the house. Service is great and fast. The restaurant has a lot of charm.",November 2019,Stou Meidani,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d5498880-Reviews-Stou_Meidani-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Very large art collection in Frankfurt,"I went to the Stadel to see the special Van Gogh exhibition. On A Friday afternoon, there was a lot of people, but you could still manage to walk through the museum in a comfortable way.
There is a very large collection of the 15th - 16th C. and one floor dedicated to modern and contemporary art.
There is a free wardrobe and you can have the audio guide for free on your smartphone however, it worked perfectly for the Van Gogh exhibition, but did not have all the descriptions for the other parts of the museum.",November 2019,Stadel Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187337-d190231-Reviews-Stadel_Museum-Frankfurt_Hesse.html,"Frankfurt, Germany",attractions,4.0,4.5
Hidden wine bar,"Located in an inner court, you need to go a couple steps down to enter the Bockenheimer weinkontor that is located in what seems to be a former warehouse.
The place is very cozy with soft music and candle light. There is a large choice of white and red wine from Germany but also from abroad and some small snacks if you feel like eating.
The glass of wine is about 5-6e.
In the summer there is a large terrace to enjoy the weather in a very green atmosphere.
The place is often full, so if you want to go there at the end of the week or during weekend, make sure to make a reservation or be willing to stand.",November 2019,Bockenheimer Weinkontor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187337-d2393787-Reviews-Bockenheimer_Weinkontor-Frankfurt_Hesse.html,"Frankfurt, Germany",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great place in Riomaggiore,"La terrazza is with no hesitation the place you want to stay at in Cinque Terre. From all the 5 villages, Riomaggiore is the nicest one with less tourists during the day and evening and great restaurants. La Terrazza has an amazing view over the entire village and you can enjoy the sunset from the terrace. Our room was spacious with a large double bed and a sofa and wardrobe and bathroom. The people holding the place are lovely and were helpful. We had a closed garage spot a bit more down in the city which was perfect. Breakfast is simple but nicely served. Compared to other hotels in Riomaggiore, this is one of the only places to have a full view and is very quiet. Of course, you need to climb some stairs to get there, but it is definitely worth it!",August 2019,B&B La Terrazza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187821-d3139167-Reviews-B_B_La_Terrazza-Riomaggiore_Cinque_Terre_Italian_Riviera_Liguria.html,"Riomaggiore, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.0
Delicious gastronomic,"We wanted to have a nice cozy restaurant for dinner. We read many good reviews about Miky and decided to go there. It was fabulous. The waiters are polite and nice, the owner of the place comes from time to time to check if all is going good.
The food was delicious! We had the anchovies starter and discovered so many flavors. Then pasta and grilled octopus. Very nice! I highly recommend it as one of the best restaurants in Cinque Terre",August 2019,Ristorante Miky,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187820-d1111550-Reviews-Ristorante_Miky-Monterosso_al_Mare_Cinque_Terre_Italian_Riviera_Liguria.html,"Monterosso al Mare, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing escape,"We spent one night at the Hotel with a Dinner at the K restaurant. It was purely amazing. There were not a lot of people and we could really enjoy the spa area. Dinner was fabulous (5 course menu) and breakfast was delicious with a lot of choice!
The suite was large and well decorated. In the evening we got some chocolates in our room together with some miniatures of the products sold at the spa area.
I also recommend the small shop near the Hotel where they sell many wines and a variety of cheese, ham and foie gras.",May 2019,Le Domaine de La Klauss,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2100349-d9790821-Reviews-Le_Domaine_de_La_Klauss-Montenach_Moselle_Grand_Est.html,"Montenach, France",hotels,5.0,4.5
Horrible old Hotel with no service,"We stayed at the Hotel for 2 nights and paid $420 for 2 nights. We were extremely disappointed. The rooms are nothing like the pictures, they are very old with stains all over the floor, the bathroom was dirty and with no service.
The breakfast was outside of the hotel one street further, there were not enough seating spots and you had to wait in line for 5min before getting one fruit salad, a hot beverage and a bagel or a Croissant.
We wanted to leave our luggage a bit longer to continue exploring the city and that was an extra $5 per item.",July 2019,Hotel Pennsylvania,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d214197-Reviews-Hotel_Pennsylvania-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,1.0,3.0
