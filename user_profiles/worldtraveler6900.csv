Put everything in the Safe,"I had all my jewelry stolen. I did not put it in the safe, big mistake.
Other than that, this hotel is in a bad part of the city. All the taxi drivers said it was not safe to walk around. There are signs up all around the businesses near by telling you that it is a high crime area. The buffet was not that good. They have no gluten free.
The music at a bar across the street blares all night till 4AM. If you want to party across the street this is the place for you. The bartender is very nice. The place is fairly clean.

My son had to go to the bar twice to get drinks for our table, because we were not checked on properly. And it was so loud and noisy in the restaurant that it was impossible to have a conversation.

It came out wrong temperature and it was like a piece of leather. The pasta came out in a soup bowl. And it had way to much sauce on it. The meal left an after taste of eating in the hospital.

Holiday getaway,"I give it 2 stars only because the staff was super nice, and the place was very clean. But the stay was horrible. We were told we were getting a junior suite with a plunge pool on the phone, $1100.00 per night. Instead they just gave us a room with a view. When we said something to them about it, they said they would get back to us but never did. Then we had New Years Dinner for $140.00 and the meal was not any better than the regular meals. We both ended up violently ill 2 hours after we ate, so we missed New Year’s Eve and lost a day being sick. We went to the seminar for becoming members, so we could get the free romantic meal, and it was a sham. They tell you one thing and then when they draw up the contract they tell you all the things it does not include, all the times you cannot use it and all the extra charges that they get ever year. It was a waist of the entire day. They tell you it only takes 90 minutes, but they kept us for 6 1/2 hours. We did not get to do anything that day, and we were only there for 3 days. I recommended skipping it you do stay here, it is not worth your time. The meals are all so similar that is does not matter which restaurant you choose. Breakfast and Lunch at the buffet everyday was the same. Then at the end they tried to charge us for wine we didn't have and for things we did not do. Arguing about this for an hour while they checked into it made us late for the airport and we almost missed our flight. We tried checking out earlier so that wouldn't be late leaving for our flight and they would not let us. Night life is a bust. There is no one out after 9pm, very boring!
