PNP service is very good & reasonably priced,"Visited Alibaug on a day trip recently and took the PNP ferry from Gateway to Mandwa and back. The ferry to Mandwa in the mid-morning was on time and it was quite packed being a Saturday. The return ferry in the evening was a few minutes late. The seating is comfortable and the cabin is airconditioned. There are speedboats that do the same trip but they are much more expensive and just a few minutes faster, We preferred to travel in a larger boat and in airconditioned comfort",February 2020,Ferry to Alibaug,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304554-d8615630-Reviews-Ferry_to_Alibaug-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",attractions,4.0,4.0
"Warm, hospitable, very clean rooms and outstanding food","I have stayed at Dina several times over the years and was there for a short visit during the off-season period. I was last there in 2014 and was very happy to see that they continue to maintain their high standards even though the property is now over 100 years old. The tollets were recently renovated, service was excellent and the food was outstanding, as expected. They over feed you with 4 to 5 course meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!, Most definitely recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Mahabalershwar",February 2020,Dina Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635749-d1178027-Reviews-Dina_Hotel-Mahabaleshwar_Satara_District_Maharashtra.html,"Mahabaleshwar, India",hotels,5.0,4.5
Once popular now empty,"Visited the restaurant around 9 pm on a weekday along with a friend who has been visiting the restaurant fairly regularly for many years. It used to be a very busy restaurant and one needed to wait to get a table because there were no reservations. We were very surprised to see that there was no one else in the restaurant when we walked in. We were there for an hour and apart from one or two food delivery boys, the only other customer was a man who walked in when we were leaving. Food quality was average - the thali is cheaper than other restaurants but it's very simple as well, Not sure if I will visit again",January 2020,Saayba Hotel Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d779854-Reviews-Saayba_Hotel_Restaurant-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Very good food but very few customers,The restaurant is recently opened in the current location and I believe it was located in Khar earlier. We visited for dinner on a weekday evening because of the very good ratings on various sites and were not disappointed. Both the seafood thali and chicken thali very excellent and quantities more than enough for one person. Unable to understand why there were hardly any other customers that evening - perhaps it's the location on a very busy road. Hope they get more clients soon otherwise it may become another casualty in the competitive restaurant business in this city,January 2020,Curry Tales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d12857168-Reviews-Curry_Tales-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Excellent small restaurant,"Located on the busy Colaba Causeway, this small restaurant has a steady stream of customers.

Excellent location and very good cleanliness standard,We were very happy with our overnight stay at this hotel. It is located in a quiet lane just off the busy Colaba causeway.

"Delayed flight, lack lustre service and shabby interiors","This was a 747-400 flight for a short Delhi-Mumbai sector. Flight was delayed by over 2 hours partly because of late arrival of the previous flight and disorganized boarding process. It was a really old aircraft with shabby interiors - the seat pockets were torn, toilet needed renovation and everything looked old inside the aircraft. Service was also mediocre with the crew just doing their job mechanically.

Very popular with the young crowd,Visited the restaurant on a Saturday evening and it got really crowded with youngsters - my guess was that most of them were in their late teens or early 20s at best. Service was very good despite the crowds. Music was much too loud but it was stuff that the youngsters enjoyed a lot. One concern - almost everyone there was below 25 and many of them were drinking hard liquor (The legal age limit for hard liquor in Maharashtra is 25). Am guessing this a violation that many restaurants that cater to the young crowd manage to get away with.,December 2019,YOUnion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d17724881-Reviews-YOUnion-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Nationalistic fervour parade,"The evening parade on both sides of the border is a very popular attraction that draws thousands of people everyday, even though it is quite far from Amritsar town.

Friendly service but delayed by an hour,The flight was delayed by an hour and we were advised in advance and so didn't have to wait for long at the airport. On board service was friendly.

Lack lustre service,"While check-in was handled smoothly, the boarding process took quite long because of long lines and waiting to board the coach to the plane.

Poor service standards and mediocre food,"We had a bad experience at our recent dinner there. We decided to go to the restaurant because of the very good reviews on another portal (not TripAdvisor). It was quite late and we requested the waiter to recommend a starter that they could serve immediately apart from the main course items ordered. He recommended a chicken starter, which never arrived. Instead our main course items arrived after a few minutes, without any apology or explanation about our starter. When the bill arrived, they keep a few wrapped mints in the saucer with the bill and we were shocked to see an empty used wrapper there - which we pointed out to the waiter, We decided to not pay the service charge because of the shoddy service and they agreed to remove it from the bill - but to our surprise they only subtracted the service charge without adjusting the taxes levied on the service charge - third service issue in one evening!!. The manager was not in the restaurant and so we could not escalate the issues we faced - 4th service issue!!, The main course items we ordered were nothing special as well - relatively small portions and lots of oil in the chicken item.

Outstanding deals but visit when it is not hot outside,"This is an open air mall and while there are several brands which are common between the south and north premium malls, there are quite a few brands in this mall which are not there in the South one. Suggest that you visit in the evening when the temperature has cooled a little",September 2019,Las Vegas North Premium Outlets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d517543-Reviews-Las_Vegas_North_Premium_Outlets-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,5.0,4.5
Huge mall with amazing deals from premium fashion brands,We spent several hours in this mall because there were so many excellent deals on offer from all the major fashion brands. Most of the shops are in the covered air-conditioned areas and therefore it is comfortable to move around. There are also several small cafes and food outlets to grab a quick bite or coffee,September 2019,Las Vegas South Premium Outlets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d116619-Reviews-Las_Vegas_South_Premium_Outlets-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,5.0,4.0
Italian ambiance with lots of premium brands,This is a large fully covered shopping area which aims to give you the feeling that you are in Rome. All the major brands have their shops there but they are not easy to find because I didn't see any map of the mall displaying where each shop is located. So you may need to walk a lot if you are looking for a specific store - like we did before we found the Apple Store,September 2019,Forum Shops at Caesars Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d102511-Reviews-Forum_Shops_at_Caesars_Palace-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,4.0,4.5
World class theater,"We watched Wicked here and even though we were in one of the upper balconies, the acoustics and view were excellent. The ushers gave us excellent directions to find our seats quickly. Seats were comfortable and toilets were also very clean",September 2019,The Smith Center for the Performing Arts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d2626704-Reviews-The_Smith_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,5.0,4.5
Classy restaurant,"We visited Bouchon for breakfast - it's not easy to find if you are trying to come via the mall but once you find it, you will not be disappointed. The ambiance is classy - right from the table decor and serving staff uniforms. We visited for breakfast and they had lots of choices. Prices were not that high for a fine-dining place. Highly recommended",September 2019,Bouchon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d423139-Reviews-Bouchon-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,5.0,4.0
