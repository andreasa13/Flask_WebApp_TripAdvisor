Great Experience,"This is a one of a kind tour led by someone who while not native to Applachia has deep roots within the community. Lily is a pagan and a historian who came into her power as a pagan later in life. She initially conceived of the tour to share the history go the area, but extended to share many of her own experiences of ghosts, hauntings and witchcraft. Fascinating, and rooted in fact and myth, the entire experience is what makes the area one of the most haunted and powerful. We were lucky to get. private tout due to others not showing up, and enjoyed every minute. Jacob, a wold dog, followed us throughout the tour. Not for all, but for those who like history and are interested in paganism, just perfect. Off the beaten track. Wear grid hiking shoes, there is a lot of uphill and downhill walking.",May 2021,The Witch Tour: Appalachian Mountains Ghost Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g54930-d18910782-The_Witch_Tour_Appalachian_Mountains_Ghost_Tour-Bybee_Tennessee.html,"Bybee, Tennessee",activities,5.0,4.5
Nicest Meal in Gatlinburg,"The reviews here don’t exaggerate — this restaurant, which is a bit off the beaten track in Gatlinburg does not disappoint. First, unlike other places in this area they take COVID safety seriously. We were greeted with a respectful request for temperature checks, properly masked staff and social distancing. It was the safest I felt all weekend. The atmosphere here was beautiful, wood, beautifully appointed. The menu features wine that is all carefully selected. We had an Oregon Pinot Noir that was fantastic. The food is tapas with a European bent. We had the Mediterranean platter with dips and grape leaves, a Bulgarian version of Spanakopita and the smoke salmon bruschetta. All were delicious. Service was attentive and did not feel rushed. Can’t say enough about this place. Price point was higher and quality matched.",May 2021,Red Oak Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60842-d14024603-Reviews-Red_Oak_Bistro-Gatlinburg_Tennessee.html,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Timeshare Sell Is Rude and Obnoxious,"Let me start by saying that when we took advantage of this Diamond orientation (as new club members) we fully expected that there would be a sell associated with the orientation. What we did not expect is that we would basically be told we were complete fools for buying the package we did, shamed that we’d purchased anything and bowled over by a rude and obnoxious salesman named “bad cop” Adam Miller. Believe me we will be writing to everyone who sent us to Bent Creek for an orientation that did not exist beyond a perfunctory “what questions do you have?” and asked with no knowledge of how to answer or respond appropriately. We started by asking a couple things before being made to feel so badly that we did not understand a needlessly complicated system that we stopped asking as Adam Miller continued to throw numbers and packages at us, stating we should have purchased that one. When I commented that I was really angry that this was not the promised orientation, we were handed over to the good cop, Connie, who attempted to smooth over the situation by basically having us download the Diamond app. While we did not get the hard sell and she was very sweet especially in comparison, we had driven over 10 hours just to download an app.

The accommodations themselves were fine, mostly clean (caveat coming) and comfortable but very small for a timeshare. The one bedroom had a double bed for two adults. The room did have cooking capabilities, and a nice fireplace as well as a screened in porch. We used the dishes provided for breakfast and I was horrified to find dried egg all over a bowl. Gross anytime but in the age of COVID extra gross.

Speaking of COVID safety people here did not get the memo that we are in the midst of a pandemic. Town was way too crowded. Staff at the hotel were not masked and Adam Miller had a mask well below his nose and mouth while sitting too close.

All in all this is an experience I will not forget for all the wrong reasons. If you care about your safety stay home. If you don’t want to be emotionally and verbally abused stay away from the timeshare talk. Not recommended.",May 2021,Bent Creek Golf Village,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60842-d225163-Reviews-Bent_Creek_Golf_Village-Gatlinburg_Tennessee.html,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",hotels,1.0,4.5
Great Stay,This historic inn was an accidental find while searching romantic getaways and it sure fits the bill. Rooms are all different and full of lovely antiques. Staff is friendly and attentive with attention to detail. On arrival we were given a tour and asked if we’d like an evening bonfire overlooking the Chesapeake. So nice. There was beach access with canoes and gorgeous grounds. Breakfast came with the room and was delicious. Outside town but not far. Great adult place to stay.

Delicious Mediterranean Meal,"We heard about Aroma from a friend who’d dined here and raved about it. Aroma did not disappoint. Great food, service and just the right pace. We started with the dip plate — hummus, baba ganoush and labne with fresh warm pita. Huge even for 3. With the large appy I had the shrimp kabob served over a very fresh salad. Shrimp were done to perfection. The guys really liked the lamb kabobs — tender, flavorful and served with tahini and rice pilaf.

Great Place — Wish We Had Longer,"I can’t say enough about this hotel. Everything was outstanding from the friendly service (especially in the breakfast room) to the amenities. They have thought about everything you could need to be comfortable and pampered. Rooms are spacious with balconies. Ours had a hot tub and there’s also an outdoor hot tub, saltwater pool and sauna. My one wish is that there was a bit of a check on that area as the people there with us had unmanageable kids which intruded on our relaxation. Close to the beach, restaurants and shopping. Breakfast was a complete meal with eggs, sausage and potato casserole as well as continental items available. We would stay again eagerly.

You Have To Be Joking!,"Whoever gave this place a certificate of excellence clearly was under the influence. I got the chipotle salmon, which was inedible. You literally could not put a fork in it, it was so overcooked. They messed up my husband’s order and brought the wrong thing. The “home made” salsa was anything but. The pork al pastor was also very overdone.

3.5 — Should Be Higher,"This is one of those places that caters to families AND tries to be upscale dining. Price points are high — sine entrees breaking $30. We were in the latter group and wanted a relaxed dining experience. Instead it was uneven. We ordered drinks, an appy, salad and entrees. Drinks were slow to arrive but not overly slow. Then nothing. We relaxed for a while enjoying the spectacular views. After about 30 minutes our server brought the entrees and appetizer all at once (no salad and missing a side). When I commented on that she seemed surprised that I no longer wanted the salad, and I had to remind her to take it off the check. The server blamed this in the kitchen. Food was good. My husband had barely finished his entree when it was being cleared and we were offered the check. No offer of dessert. Classic wait and then hurry up. We heard similar complaints from other diners in our section so unclear if it’s a service or management issue. We didn’t have a truly enjoyable meal. Definite kinks to work out here.",April 2021,Waterman's Crab House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41351-d517195-Reviews-Waterman_s_Crab_House-Rock_Hall_Maryland.html,"Rock Hall, Maryland",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Great Place to Stay,"The Residence Inn Bridgewater is a great place to stay. Rooms are large and comfortable and have all the amenities including a fridge, microwave, TV and comfy couch.

Very Nice Hotel Just off Beach,"We stayed at La Mer on a Tripadvisor rate off season. The hotel was clean and staff friendly. Pool much smaller than it appears in the hotel pics (beware) and no hot tub. It's located practically next door to a fine dining option (Peter Shields Inn) so if you are a foodie, do that. Our balcony did not have a view at all, and felt closed in, and the hotel catered to families, some of whom let kids run in the hall at 11pm. All this not the hotel's fault, but important to know. The location is about 20 mins stroll from the Washington Mall -- great on a nice day -- on a rainy day not as desirable. We would stay again.",October 2020,La Mer Beachfront Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g46341-d121407-Reviews-La_Mer_Beachfront_Resort-Cape_May_Cape_May_County_New_Jersey.html,"Cape May, New Jersey",hotels,4.0,4.0
Lovely Meal and Service,"We were fortunate to get reservations at the Shields Restaurant for a Cape May getaway. The meal was excellent and the service equally fine. It is a BYOB, so don't forget your wine. We started with the Burrata salad, soft and creamy with roasted beets. My main was the local scallops. They were done just right, and accompanied by sweet potato grits. My husband had the pork chop, which he loved. For dessert we shared the chocolate pana cota, very light and served with a dollop of peanut butter and pistachio. Portions were on the smaller side, so you can actually have and try more options. Prices reflect the fine dining. The porch was a great place to catch a sunset. Reservations are a must, We would definitely recommend this place -- it's excellent.",October 2020,Peter Shields Inn & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46341-d393821-Reviews-Peter_Shields_Inn_Restaurant-Cape_May_Cape_May_County_New_Jersey.html,"Cape May, New Jersey",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Thoroughly Forgettable Breakfast,"We had brunch here today, and despite a menu that was different and showed promise the food did not live up to expectations (bland and not well cooked). It was a cold rainy day, and we were happy to be offered a place by the fireplace. We were told upfront that the staff was taxed, and thus pleasantly surprised when the server immediately took drink orders. After 20 mins, no coffee. We asked the buser, nothing. Third time was a charm. After delivering the drinks, the server finally came back 10 or 15 mins later. We ordered. While waiting, someone from the restaurant asked how we liked the fireplace, and we responded affirmatively. He then came back a few minutes later and said ""you lose,"" and turned it off. Our meals were pretty but tasteless. The pumpkin pancakes had no real taste of pumpkin, and the eggs were overcooked. Same for my hubby's loaded hash browns. Just ok. With all the dining options in Cape May, even off season, we will not be dining here again.",October 2020,Elaine's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46341-d1846161-Reviews-Elaine_s-Cape_May_Cape_May_County_New_Jersey.html,"Cape May, New Jersey",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Great Cider and Atmosphere,"We stopped at this cidery, among others, and on a recent trip to the area. This was our favorite, very nice setting with outdoor tables. Nice atmosphere. We did a flight, which we shared. We did have to order food due to change in NY laws, and the rosemary fries were excellent. They also had some really nice looking pizzas, including a fog pizza.

"Great Staff, Comfortable Stay","Stayed here on a recent visit to the area. Located in the midst of shopping and strip malls, but still close to the things we came for (small towns, cideries and wineries). COVID precautions shut down some amenities like the breakfast, and we missed the grab and go hours (they are quite prompt in taking it down). Room was clean and identical to other courtyards. Did find a Starbucks in the nearby Target, so missing breakfast not a problem. Front desk staff very helpful and accommodating. Would stay here again.

Excellent and Plenty of Vegetarian Options,"We dined here just this past week and enjoyed it immensely. Unlike the prior review, I thought there were many good vegetarian options (sweet potato tacos, buffalo cauliflower tacos), salads and bowls. We are pescatarian, increasing the options. We started with the plantain appetizer, which I liked but imagined differently from the ,menu description -- much firmer than I thought, and the chips and salsa (very fresh). Our mains were the sweet potato tacos (made with cartelized onions and pepitas and the fish tacos (halibut today). That was delicious and very fresh. Drinks were also tasty. Large servings left no room for dessert. We would definitely dine here again.

Enjoyable Meal,"We recently dined here on a visit to Asbury. It was a beautiful day, so we wanted a place on the Boardwalk. We were told there would be a long wait for the main dining area, but were invited to take a table on the upper floor overlooking the ocean -- no table service (order at the bar). Menu was very similar to in the main dining room, and while there were a few snafus (our dining companion did not get the shrimp that was supposed to be on her salad initially) the experience was positive. Beautiful view. The drink that I had (and which was expensive) tasted like a mocktail -- no zing at all -- bringing the rating here down. My salad (kale caesar, added a crab cake) and my husband's fish and chips were both excellent. Overall very good.",September 2020,Iron Whale,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29748-d17567606-Reviews-Iron_Whale-Asbury_Park_New_Jersey.html,"Asbury Park, New Jersey",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Clean, convenient, great staff","Great weekend stay at the Marriott in Lenox -- located just on the edge of town about a 5 minute drive away. Rooms very very clean and comfortable, and COVID safety precautions evident in all regards. Lenox itself, as well as nearly Great Barrington was a great getaway and this was the perfect base. Everything felt very modern. About the only constructive feedback was that the room fridge seemed to be on a 4 hour timer, making it pretty inconvenient for use as a fridge.

Yummy Crepes,"We stopped here for a quick snack mid-day, and were pleased with how yummy the crepes were.

Great for Sunday Brunch,"We chose this cute little spot for brunch on Sunday morning -- great staff, good food. French toast was thick cut and tasty (although it was not cinnamon raisin as advertised), eggs fluffy and the omelettes are excellent. One disappointment was that they were out of the churro beignets -- one of the reasons we picked the restaurant.

Top Notch in Every Way,"We ate at Alta Wine bar during a recent trip to Lenox. Even with COVID, all was excellent, not a single misstep. Service was attentive and informative, the hostess checked up on us and made sure to nicely remind diners to always have masks, tables were disinfected very thoroughly between diners and were well spaced out. The food was excellent and wine selections were nice complements. We started with an Arctic char appetizer (toasted bread and picked veggies). Big enough for two, and very tasty, My dinner special -- shrimp and scallops over orzo had olives, veggies and Mediterranean flavors, and was very nice. My husband had the tofu, which was nice and crispy. While we did not have room for dessert, looked to be some nice options.

Had An Average Meal,"Maybe it's what I ordered but not sure where the raves come in here. Certainly the restaurant was hampered by COVID, but for a wrap and burger we waited 45 mins or so with no check in at all from the servers. My shrimp wrap was really bland. My husband wound up sharing his black bean burger, which while messy was pretty good.

Wonderful Mind/Body Getaway,"The Lodge at Woodloch is an amazing place to visit -- luxury accommodations, beautiful scenery, a spa that offers two hot tubs plus other amenities, delicious meals and all kinds of activities from art to meditation to yoga and kayaking. We love active vacations, and as we were sticking close to home due to COVID, The Lodge offered a wonderful getaway. Overall we had a great experience, although there were some snafus with meals the restaurant manager was responsive to the feedback. We enjoyed the array of mind-body offerings. To limit class size, advance reservations are needed, so we had quite a full itinerary from the get go. One nice perk of remaining local for us is that the Lodge welcomes you at any time on your check in day, and also is fine with you staying past the time you check out the final day. We stayed two nights and had three very full days, being sure to carve out some R&R time on the Sunday. While many of the meditation classes seemed focused towards beginners, and we are experienced meditators, that was the demographic, and when on some occasions my husband and I wound up being the sole class members, the instructors had no problem raising that bar. In the three days we actually got to know the instructors well -- they teach multiple classes -- and returning will almost feel like going back to see old friends. While the price point is dear, with so much included and so little else open and available we did not balk at paying it. I would recommend the Lodge for an extended weekend, and could easily have stayed longer. Rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The balconies could have used some lighting, however, and an outdoor pool would be nice in the summer. Despite those small things this place is definitely 5 stars.",July 2020,The Lodge at Woodloch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g52802-d620073-Reviews-The_Lodge_at_Woodloch-Hawley_Pocono_Mountains_Region_Pennsylvania.html,"Hawley, Pennsylvania",hotels,5.0,5.0
Uneven Service -- 3.5,"I am reviewing the restaurant separately from our Lodge stay because the overall time at the Lodge was excellent and this part of the stay stands out as more problematic. I found our experiences in Tree -- which should have been universally excellent -- to be very uneven. I would have provided this detail to the manager on duty Sunday evening, however, no manager came to our table at dinner that evening.

Starting with the positives, we had 3 excellent meals Saturday. The food was good, menu fabulous with veggies grown on site, and locally sourced meats and seafoods. There is one available menu for breakfasts and lunchs, and two rotating dinner menus. A couple specials appear nightly. Other spas such as Mirival do tend to have more options and a huge buffet, and I'm not sure if options would have been larger during a time other than a pandemic. On Saturday evening, our server at dinner (clearly experienced) was wonderful and took time to describe every detail of the menu, make drink suggestions, and even offered that they send the dessert we were too full for to our room later in the evening. On Saturday, a manager came to our table and checked on us. We were very happy. The food was fresh, and I liked everything I tried from the crab tostada to the scallops (delicious). The dessert was a little sweet for my taste (strawberry pistachio cake). I did love the chocolate clove bites out as a snack earlier -- just the right level of sweetness.

Sunday was a VERY different story. It began with the appetizer course. Our server took our order, and we opted to skip the salad course because we were so full the evening prior. 45 minutes after ordering, no appetizers, and not a single check in from our server. When she finally happened to pass by our table and saw no food on the table, we let her know that the appetizers had not arrived. There was a halfhearted apology and promise to check. After another 10 minutes, she brought them to our table and placed the wrong items in front of each of us, and this time did not acknowledge any problem. The appetizers were good, especially the corn chowder. The mains then came very quickly after the appetizers, now with no attention to spacing things. A runner delivered these and quickly departed. My pasta was under seasoned (I would say most things there were -- likely intentional). With COVID, you needed to request a salt shaker, and you guessed it, no one came to check in. Finally we saw the runner, who had just cleared the table behind us, and requested salt and pepper, which she proceeded to hand us from the table she just cleared. That is how COVID spreads -- completely inexcusable. I requested that she remove it and provide a sanitized set, which she did with much more sincere apologies. Following the salt and pepper incident, again no check ins from the server or runner, even though we needed more water and the bread was empty. We ate our meals, which were fine. My husband was finished his main, and I was lukewarm about dessert, so we finally just got up and left. Not a stellar meal.

At breakfast the following morning we had the same difficulties with no one checking in, but did mange to flag a very good runner for salt and pepper and ketchup, which was not included with the potatoes although my husband had explicitly requested it.

While our Lodge visit was top notch, the restaurant has some major training issues. The inclusion of food was part of the price point we paid, and at this price point the meals should be flawless. While I appreciate that COVID has changed so many processes, this is really problematic. I have decided to review the restaurant separately and to forward this review to the Lodge in hopes that these things will be changed for other visitors. The basic message to management: check on your guests. See if they are enjoying their meals or need anything. Simple.",July 2020,TREE Restaurant & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g52802-d6990188-Reviews-TREE_Restaurant_Bar-Hawley_Pocono_Mountains_Region_Pennsylvania.html,"Hawley, Pennsylvania",restaurants,3.0,5.0
Very Nice Meal,"We recently dined at Boulevard Seafood. It was in a period with outdoor seating only, so can't be sure everything I'm saying extends to more normal times. It was a very nice meal. We started with the Tuna Poke, which was served with tuna, scallions, avocado and citrus. Nice start to the meal, although the poke could have had more citrus (some ginger would have been nice as well). For my main I had the fish tacos. I was excited that you could mix the kinds of tacos (I had tuna, shrimp and cod). All were very good, topped with a mango salsa (mango could have been riper) and pickled onions. My husband's special, the swordfish (ancho Chile, served over broccoli rabe) was cooked perfectly and a real standout. Service was competent, although some small things could have been improved, such as bringing a spoon with the poke since we were sharing, and letting us know in advance that the water was a bottle and not tap. It was fine, but when charging for water, that should be mentioned. During COVID, tables were well-spaced, although they are on the sidewalk so pedestrians do walk pretty close, and while masks are NOT optional in Somerville apparently many people missed that memo.",June 2020,Boulevard Seafood Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46827-d10291632-Reviews-Boulevard_Seafood_Company-Somerville_New_Jersey.html,"Somerville, New Jersey",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Outdoor Dining on the Canal,"We were thrilled to be among the first diners welcomed back to the Riegelsville Inn following the stay-at-home order. With the reopening, the Inn is offering a limited menu, and this review does allow some latitude for the adjustment to limited seating, a different menu and generally managing people who have not had a meal out in some time. When we arrived at the restaurant at what we thought would be a slow time (a little before 5:00), it was packed, and it was pretty unclear what to do to get our name on a list. Masked, we entered the building, and the hostess attempted to seat us at two separate ""open"" tables that were actually occupied. It seems people other than us were seating themselves, which could have been remedied by a sign with directions to put ones name on a list. We waited about 20 minutes, no big deal, and were seated on the canal side, which was lovely. The tables were spaced at least 6 feet apart if not more, and the hostess put a fresh tablecloth on in front of us. There are no menus out of care for infection, so it's helpful to have your phone, which we did (I did notice a menu on the wall out front just in case). The limited menu still has plenty of options: appys, sandwiches, entrees and desserts. My husband and I both ordered the crabcake sandwich, mine with sweet potato fries and his with regular fries. Service was leisurely, but not in a bothersome way, although when the meals came out it was clear by the limp state of my sweet potato fries that mine had been sitting waiting for his crispy regular fries to finish. With all that was going on it was ok, and I trust that they will work out the kinks of outdoor seating only and curbside pickup. We were just grateful to be in a quiet outdoor setting and not to be eating another takeout meal. We'll give them another try.",June 2020,Riegelsville Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g53550-d459397-Reviews-Riegelsville_Inn-Riegelsville_Pennsylvania.html,"Riegelsville, Pennsylvania",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Food Overcooked and Service Poor,We ate here on the strong recommendations posted on TripAdvisor. It almost seems like we ate someplace different.

Favorite Meal in Cuba,"Ate here with a group on a recent trip to Cuba. Outside of Havana, but worth the drive for an excellent meal in a quaint town.

"3.5 Overall Good, Not Great","This restaurant was recommended by our guide when going to see the show at the National (a few block away). Nice atmosphere, and very accommodating to a larger group. Overall more pricey than some of the places we dined in Cuba, and seemed to serve more of a tourist niche. Appetizers were probably the weakest of the choices, and the plantain stuffed with cheese and ham was completely overcooked to the point of being inedible. Similarly the bruschetta was not standout. We enjoyed the mains -- I had the swordfish with a green sauce. While it could have used more spice, it tasted good. The grilled veggies (a separate cost) were bland. My husband had the pork, and enjoyed it. Desserts were nothing special.

Very Enjoyable Matinee (Understudy),"I'm not sure it's fair to rate the Tina Tuner show on when there's an understudy as lead. I adore Tina Turner and her music, and have read the autobiography the show is based on. Tina's life was a definite roller coaster, and this showed in the storyline. The second act was definitely engaging and high energy. While the first act set the stage, the primary reason or a 4 rather than a 5 is that even from very close Orchestra seats we had difficulty hearing (especially the lead) the words of songs -- even those we were familiar with. All in all this was a great show (based on act 2 one of the best true stories I've seen) but the understudy playing Tina needs to pump up the volume in Part 1.",February 2020,Tina Turner on Broadway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g60763-d18274939-Tina_Turner_on_Broadway-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",activities,4.0,4.5
3.5 Average Brunch,"We went to Docks for Brunch based on some of the online reviews and the menu listed on the website. Several of the things on the online menu were not on the actual menu. Mu husband wound up ordering the Lobster Hash, which if rating on this alone would have generated good reviews. Great flavor and presentation. My frittata was average to poor, being very dry and overcooked. One did one bottomless brunch ($30) and the frittata, so the overall price point was high enough where a dry frittata just does not cut it. Unlike other reviewers I did not find the servers rude (thank goodness) but they were also not all that attentive. No one came to the table between the runner dropping the food and handing us the check. If they had I would have provided this feedback directly instead of through Tripadvisor only. Management needs to step up the brunch -- there are lots of choices in NYC and we will choose differently next time.",February 2020,Docks Oyster Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d527836-Reviews-Docks_Oyster_Bar-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Delicious Smoked Fish,"Zuckers is just what you expect from a NY bagel store without needing to go to the Lower East side. Great bagels and creative sandwiches that are not at all skimpy. I had the Alton Brown, which was horseradish cream cheese, avocado and smoked trout. It was delicious and bog enough so I have half to eat tomorrow. My husband also thoroughly enjoyed his whitefish salad. One critique: seating. Not nearly enough for a place this popular.

"Great Room, Great Location","The Tuscany is a signature boutique hotel located near Grand Central. The hotel itself is very nice, and the rooms extremely spacious for New York.

We easily walked from Penn Station, and later in the evening took a subway into Grand Central following our show. Hotel is close to many good restaurants (much better than the Times Square area).

Delicious and Friendly Meal,"This was a great meal -- delicious -- and friendly service. Love the concept of this restaurant, Asian Latin fusion, and the flavor combination was so unique and yummy. We started with the shrimp lettuce wraps -- wow -- made with chorizo and shrimp. My mains were the seared tuna salad and the miso soup, which was made with Chile peppers. Interesting flavors. My husband had several of the small plates and really liked each one. His favorite was the Al Pastor steamed buns. So many unique things to try. We went for a pre-show dinner, and based on the other reviews I'd recommend that. Service was excellent and attentive, and the restaurant was quiet. I can see how they would get loud in there.

Excellent and Informative,"While I thought I knew something about LGBT history, Kathy's extraordinary knowledge and love of the neighborhood made this tour both a delight and a definite learning experience. Kathy is a heritage tour operator, and takes groups on this tour most days off the week. We had a relatively small group, and everyone was invited to participate, ask questions, and act as sources of information. While this is a tour of SF's Castro, it is also about the history of LGBT people everywhere, and the continued need to expand LGBT and human rights. Kathy took us to many of the important places in the Castro, including Harvey Milk plaza, the Harvey Milk school and Harvey Milk's former home and camera shop, now housing the HRC. Did I say Harvey Milk. He, and his contributions, are very much evident here, and much more than a documentary can show. I enjoyed every stop, and found the triangle park and seeing a portion of the AIDs quilt especially moving. My daughter, who is typically lukewarm about such tours also loved it, and was able to share her knowledge as a former HIV counselor.

Excellent Tour,"We recently took the Rooted Fork Foodie Tour of downtown Napa. With it being offseason our choices of tour dates was limited, and if you can I'd recommend doing this tour at the beginning of your Napa trip because you will discover lots of great places to eat, including several that you likely would not try on your own. The guide, Virginia, was excellent, very knowledgable about the area, and as a CIA grad, about food as well. Everyplace we tried was great, and shared a signature dish that highlighted their cuisine, and a drink. Most were ""California style"" dishes, so healthy. Being a Pescatarian was not a problem, and in only in one place was the substitute dish disappointing (it was the first time that restaurant was on the tour, so a learning experience for them). We started at Tarla, where we'd already eaten, but which had some delicious zucchini fritters and a Mediterranean cocktail. Yum! Some other highlights of the tour included Norman Rose (not a place that we would have chosen from the outside, but very nice and great sliders -- mine a fish slider), the brittles from Annettes Chocolates (wow!!) and the mushroom soup from The Kitchen Door in the Oxbow market. In addition to the tastings, we had a nice tour of downtown, some local history, and an afternoon of culinary delights. All was very well-paced and enough without being too much. I'd highly recommend this experience. One piece of constructive feedback -- while they were great communicators, the number of reminders, especially for gratuities, were a few too many. That could just be me though.",December 2019,Rooted Fork Foodie Tours: Taste of Downtown Napa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g32766-d16860944-Rooted_Fork_Foodie_Tours_Taste_of_Downtown_Napa-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html,"Napa, California",activities,5.0,5.0

We stuck to some childhood favorites including shrimp with lobster sauce and lomein. The fried pumpkin appetizer was interesting and not greasy. Generous portions.

Good Ramen,This ramen house located close to the Japanese mall in Japan Town offers fresh and flavorful ramen dishes keeping up with the popularity of a dish that was once only found in 25 cent boil in bag packets. There are some few choices including one vegetarian (good) and a garlic one my husband really enjoyed. Good service. There were also a couple appetizers and a few beverages. I would have preferred the veggie broth to bring more highly favored and added seasonings but did appreciate the spinach and tofu.

Very Good Food and Rustic Atmosphere,"This small cafe, located in Duncan Mills, is a nice place to stop for a meal. Be aware that service is ... leisurely ... but the food when it comes is quite good. We started with the shrimp and grits appetizer, excellent and well spiced. Dinner portions were large, and came with a house or Caesar salad. Some of the items on the menu were not available that evening (salmon and ribs) -- the server should have mentioned that because we heard the same thing repeated table to table. I had the smoked salmon tortellini, which was excellent and very filling. My husband and daughter both pted for fish and chips, which was crispy and fresh. Dessert this evening was complimentary as the owner had leftovers from Christmas the evening before.

Nice Little Museum,"Charles Schultz and his Peanuts characters are mainstays of many of our childhoods, and with Schultz being a former longtime resident of this area it makes sense that the museum is housed here. It's primarily a collection of his comics, some rarer, and some very early and which trace the history of the Peanuts characters. With it being the anniversary of ""Woodstock"" (the concert that is) the main exhibit traced Peanut's character Woodstock's history. Very interesting to see the changing character. Upstairs there was another exhibit on magic (meh) and a recreation of Schultz's office workspace. If you are in the area, it's definitely worth a stop.",December 2019,Charles M.

Christmas Was Hectic -- Good Food,"This was one of the few places open on Christmas day, and we made reservations well in advance. When we arrived it was only a short wait but we were given what had to be the worst table in the place -- on the end and right outside the doorway if the next room. I realize it was very crowded but this table was awful. People waiting crowded on one side, staff bumping us rushing back and forth. I get how busy it was but we'd planned well ahead and this took away from the experience. My recommendation is not seating people there when it's so mobbed. Food was very good from a nice wine selection to appetizer and good entrees. Desserts were ok -- not a fan of the pistachio baklava, which was mushy and not crispy like I enjoy. I liked my stuffed eggplant -- very flavorful.

Loved This Market,"Its hard to imagine Napa without the Oxbow Public Market (although it hasn't always been here). Located on the other side away from other Napa businesses (but walkable), the market features mostly eateries and some interesting ones at that. It ranges from a full service restaurant (the Kitchen Door, which is excellent) to a distillery, chocolate and cheese shops. You can get just about anything you want or need there. Over the time we have been in Napa we have tried several of the establishments, and all have been good. It's hard to find parking here, so you may want to park in a public lot on the other side and walk over (there are two lots, very full daytimes). Some shout outs to Kara's Cupcakes (located in the corner across from the pizza/bar, so a bit hard to see), Gotts (eclectic menu with enough for everyone). Be aware that some of the merchants are pricey -- such as the cheese -- although a great selection, and e paid $7 at the Greens stand for bagged kettle chips.

Beautiful Views But Underwhelmed By the Wine,"Sterling was a much different experience than many of the wineries we visited in the Napa area. The main attraction is the aerial tram to the top, where you take a self-guided tour through the production facilities. There were several tasting options, and the basic ($35 per person) included the tram and 5 tastes. While the team ride was fantastic, and allowed some wonderful views of nearby Calistoga, the wine tasting itself was just ok.

With breathtaking grounds, a nice wine shop and wonderful pairings this winery located along Dry Creek Road outside of downtown Healdsburg, is worth a trip. We splurged on the cheese and chocolate tasting ($50), which although pricey, mirrors the expense of the wines (the wines we tasted ranged from $34-90). This wound up being a private tasting, and we were shown to a nicely appointed room downstairs where wines were poured, each with a small slice of cheese and a chocolate. Our guide suggested we taste the cheese first, then the wine, then follow with the wine and chocolate. The pairings were excellent and great complements. We got to taste the Cab, reserve Cab, Tresor, Prevail and Prevail Back Forty. I liked all the wines, and even cheese I don't normally love was good as well.

"Fun Meal, Casual Vibe","It's nice to find a casual restaurant in Napa that also has good food. The Kitchen Door, located inside the Oxbow Market, fits that bill. The menu is eclectic, with a mix of foods ranging from ramen and soups, to seafood, to burgers. We started with the Brussels sprouts appetizer, which was charred and served with a yogurt sauce. Excellent. My husband enjoyed his burger, although it was shy of the medium they promised. My lox and latkes entree contained several slices of lox, some salad greens and a nicely done latke (fluffy, which is how I like them). Very tasty, although just a bit salty.

Poorly Maintained,"This resort has some wonderful pros and should easily score a 5, but there are too many downsides. Most have to do with maintenance issues that should not exist with a Wyndam property.

Pros: Location is great -- easy drive to Napa and all of wine country, restaurants close
Amenities: Pool, nice grounds, across from tasting rooms, washer and dryer
Rooms feature fridge, microwave, coffee maker

Cons: wallpaper was ripped, safe not working, general wear and tear
Missing things that are needed such as a sharp knife
In studio a sofa bed would have been more useful than two double beds -- no real seating made it much less comfortable
Things promised like laundry soap for first load missing
Very loud heating and washer
Timeshare pitch was a hard sell despite assertions to the contrary

The biggest problem was right outside our room a huge hole in the ceiling which was leaking right on the floor with no attempt to correct it. There was not even an effort to alert people to a slip hazard

While we had a nice time some huge maintenance issues made this less appealing. I would not buy into this property seeing these issues.

Good Casual Food,"We were looking fir something more casual on our recent trip to Sonoma. Many of eateries in town are fancy and far more than a simple lunch spot. Basque fit the bill. Sandwiches, salads, soup. Order at the counter and wait to be called for pickup then grab a seat inside or outside. We had the onion tart, like a quiche and light and tasty. The salad could have been dressed better and fresher. I took back a scone, which was good but not as moist or flaky as some. The 4 is for friendly service and the niche it fits.

We were not disappointed. On a cold Sunday evening after 7:00, most of the tables were full, but we did get seated immediately. The interior was fun and casual. We decided on an appetizer (the brussels sprouts Caesar) and a pizza. The Caesar was excellent and very different -- thinly shredded Brussels Sprouts with dressing and homemade croutons. We chose the seasonal delicata squash pizza with Buffalo mozzarella, sage and parmesan. It was excellent, very different and tasty on a thin crust and plenty for two to share.

Tasty and Relaxing Meal,"While there are some mixed reviews here, we had a great experience at the CIA at Copia, located right near the Oxbow Market. We went to the restaurant with slightly different expectations, having visited the Rhinebeck location of the CIA many times. Unlike Rhinebeck (and apparently the CIA location in St. Helena) the hostess described this restaurant as ""professionally run"" rather than student run. This was a bit disappointing since we really like the experience of interacting with the students (and the fixed price menu). The servers and chefs here are young, perhaps CIA grads? We started with a shared appetizer, the Delicata squash, served with a spicy yogurt sauce (it could have used more salt). It was good, the sauce perhaps a bit spicy for my palate. My main was the rockfish, made with a curry sauce and cauliflower on the side. It was done perfectly and tasty. My husband declared his pork chop the best he's had in recent memory. Service was friendly and attentive. Many wine offerings, although the local wines are pricey at about $16 a glass we opted for that. By the end of the meal we were too full for dessert, although it looked like some nice options. Our bill, minus tip, was $116 of two mains and a appetizer, so it's fine dining. The atmosphere is modern. The restaurant was less crowded on a Saturday than expected, but perhaps it's the time of year. While I'd definitely recommend the CIA at Copia, just be sure you know it's not student run. High quality and relaxing, but there is something nice about interacting with the students that you may miss here.",December 2019,The CIA at Copia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32766-d11873286-Reviews-The_CIA_at_Copia-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html,"Napa, California",attractions,5.0,4.0
Lovely Winery Visit,"This winery, located in St. Helena, is a lovely place to visit. Great grounds, reasonable choices of tastings and food available. We found it on the Priority Wine Pass (which I would highly recommend -- it pays for itself), which entitled us to two tastings for $20. We started with some food (you can't take food to the tasting bar). It's a very busy winery, perhaps because of the pass or being on the wine train. On the day of our visit, there were the food offerings in the deli onsite or from a food truck. We had the grilled cheese and soup from the truck. All the truck's offerings were meant to accompany a bottle of wine. Inside we did the wine tasting, which allowed us to select 5 wines. The bartender was very sweet, and enthusiastic about the wines. We stuck to the reds, and enjoyed the Pinot, Zinfandel and Cab Sav. This winery does not sell retail, so batches are small, and bottles are pricey (about $50 a bottle) so we limited ourselves to 1 which we will hold for a special occasion. Cases were discounted. Grounds were really pretty, and worth taking some time to wander before proceeding to your next stop. The town of St. Helena is also worth a visit but closes about 6:00/",December 2019,V.
