Must see,"If you want to know the ancient history of the Parthenon and the Acropolis then please start here!

This museum is fantastic with places to sit, air conditioning and full of enriching information about some of Greece’s most important monuments. Not to mention they have a restaurant with stunning views of the Acropolis on the second level.

Would 100% recommend coming here first before going up to the Acropolis as the artefacts collected and displayed here tell the story for you and it is easier to use your imagination when you arrive at the Acropolis.

There is a seating area with a screen in all different languages with English subtitles so you can catch the short film and still understand.",October 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Unmissable,"The most astounding piece of Ancient Greek history left with us and it does not disappoint.

Would 100% recommend going to the Acropolis museum before you go up as you learn everything there is to know about this magnificent structure and its history. This makes the difference from looking at an old marble monument to using your imagination looking at every Parthenon frieze with it telling a story.

The only downside was the scaffolding as they are doing restoration works however rather a Parthenon with scaffolding than no Parthenon at all.

We entered by the gates nearest to Acropoli metro station and got in for free as it was Oxi Day (28th Oct). We spent around 2 hours here but you can take as long or as short as you like.

The views of Athens once up there are incredible with sights of Piraeus and Glyfada on one side and the white washed walls of Athens all around on the other.

Please note that the attractions included on the €30 ticket are all FREE every Sunday between November - March. We would have paid the €20 entrance fee to see it though as it is just spectacular and a must if you are in Athens, it just so happened that the day we had planned to see it on was a Greek national holiday so we had saved €40 and counted our blessings!

The €30 combined ticket is definitely worth paying for if you are interested in the Temple of Zeus, the Acropolis Museum, the Archeological Museum and so on.

However if you are there to just see the Acropolis, go on a Sunday between November to March and spend the money you have saved on a meal in a local restaurant around the Acropolis and a well deserved drink!

*WHEELCHAIR USERS OR MOBILITY ISSUES PLEASE READ* ———

To finish I’d like to add that I had dislocated my knee during the week we were in Athens and still managed to hobble to the top with a good partner and a slow pace. There IS a lift for wheelchair access but it has been suspended as works for its replacement are in progress (this was emailed to me 4th November 2020). So please do email or ring in advance so you can plan ahead.",October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
The food is better than the view!,"Came here for our last night in Athens as it was close to where we were staying. Sat upstairs on the roof top and the view alone takes your breath away.

Had the slow cooked lamb and my partner had the braised beef - all I can say is WOW! The meat fell apart and I could have sworn that each mouthful tasted more delicious than the last.

With the amazing view and delicious food, this restaurant oozes elegance and authentic Greek dining at a good price.

Will definitely be coming again when we are back in Athens and be attempting to make what we had in the mean time to tide us over !!!

We are so lucky to have found this amazing place by chance - please if you’re in the area you must visit!

(We would have taken pictures of the food but it looked too delicious to wait!)",October 2020,Sin Athina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3709115-Reviews-Sin_Athina-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
1 star hotel with 5 star views!,"Booked our trip 48 hours in advance and came across Afrodete Hotel purely by chance and all I can say is WOW!

To travel during a pandemic can knock even the bravest of travellers with all of the restrictions and possible quarantines being put back in place last minute, but the Afrodete Hotel have made us feel more safe and protected from Covid-19 there than anywhere back home in England. With all staff wearing masks and gloves on check in and check out in 30 degree, the rooms are thoroughly cleaned daily.

For a one star hotel this place has everything you need after a full day of exploring the island. The bathroom has a hairdryer on the wall along with little bottles of shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower gel AND hand sanitiser replenished daily after use.

We stayed in room number 5 and had a beautiful view of the sunrise (as pictured) with a little balcony over looking the east side of the island.

Although the swimming pool is small, there are 3 sun loungers to sit by the pool on and towels are available on request from the office if you haven’t got your own or are drying off.

A 5 minute walk from the heart of Fira and town centre with lots of shops, bakeries, cafés and tavernas on the way. This is the perfect place to stay if you want to be central but without the hustle and bustle of a busy town centre.

The local and friendly staff made our stay absolutely perfect.

Thank you so much - we will definitely see you again next year :-)",July 2020,Afrodete Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635607-d1804884-Reviews-Afrodete_Hotel-Firostefani_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
