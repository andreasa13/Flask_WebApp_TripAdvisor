"This a reasonably good hotel is for its price range, on the outskirts of Pune","This is a reasonably good hotel in its price range. The location is good if you want to access Baner road or Balewadi part of Pune or else you need to have a car to be mobile.
Also make sure you book to stay in the new wing. The old wing is a bit run down.
Be prepared for slightly slow service standards as staff to guests ratio is adverse.

Rooms were ok in size and reasonably well appointed, though some elements of decor esp carpets and furnishing could have been less garish.

The food at restaurant is reasonably good. There is an all day buffet. The free wifi was adequate.",March 2020,The Orchid Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297654-d2304344-Reviews-The_Orchid_Hotel-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,"Pune, India",hotels,3.0,4.0

Great meal at this hidden gem in Anjuna locality of Goa,"We had lunch at Edible Archives for a celebration.

Fairly good restaurant for Continental food in Yangon,"This is restaurant in downtown Yangon, located in the Loft Hotel. The ambience of the restaurant and the service was good. It has reasonable vegetarian selection of dishes. The soup, salad and pasta we ordered were good but the Burmese food ( Prawn curry) was bland and should have been better. The dessert ( chocolate profiteroles) was very good. If you are staying at hotel you should check out this restaurant though they need to step up a bit on the Burmese cuisine.",November 2019,Alex's Gastro Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294191-d8645735-Reviews-Alex_s_Gastro_Bar-Yangon_Rangoon_Yangon_Region.html,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Wonderful lake, with a well maintained park worth visiting","Kandawgyi Lake is one of two major lakes in Yangon and is located east of the Shwedagon Pagoda. It is ~8 km in circumference, and is surrounded by the Kandawgyi Nature Park and the Yangon Zoological Gardens, which consists of a zoo, an aquarium and an amusement park. It is a great place for a walk in the evening or morning. We were staying at the new Wyndham Grand hotel which is very close to the lake and has great views of the Lake and the Shwedagon Pagoda",November 2019,Kandawgyi Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294191-d3731466-Reviews-Kandawgyi_Park-Yangon_Rangoon_Yangon_Region.html,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",attractions,5.0,4.0
Worth visiting this low key monument to see tomb of the Last Mughal,"We walked to the tomb of Bahadur Shah Zafar II, the last Mughal Emperor, who was exiled in Rangoon by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Zafar's unassuming tomb is in a quiet avenue in Yangon not too far from the famous Shwedagon Pagoda. Zafar was not only the last Mughal but was a Urdu poet and is now revered as a Sufi saint.

This was the highlight of our Yangon visit,"Best time to see the Shwedagon Pagoda is in the night when it is beautifully lit and the weather is much cooler. It is located west of Kandawgyi Lake and at 100 m in height it dominates the Yangon skyline. It is probably the most sacred Buddhist pagoda in Myanmar and maybe the world. It therefore can get quite crowded with local worshipers. There is a separate entrance for foreigners, where they can take of their shoes, pay entrance fee of 10,000 kyats per person and be taken by lifts to the main pagoda complex. It is quite awe inspiring to see the main gold-plated dome, which is topped by a stupa containing over 7,000 diamonds, rubies, topaz and sapphires.",November 2019,Shwedagon Pagoda,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294191-d1985342-Reviews-Shwedagon_Pagoda-Yangon_Rangoon_Yangon_Region.html,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",attractions,5.0,5.0
Lovely boutique hotel in heart of Yangon,"We stayed one night at the Loft . It is boutique hotel located close to the centre of Yangon, not far from Bogyoke Aung San Market (~10 mins walk), the Sule Pagoda/Independence Monument (15 mins walk) or the Shwedagon Pagoda ( 30 mins walk or a short taxi ride). The hotel is designed very aesthetically in minimalist way but with a ethnic touch which is pleasing. The rooms are fairly large and good value for money. The rooms are furnished well and have the usual amenities. The free wifi was effective both in rooms and lobby area. We could not sample the buffet breakfast as we had to catch an early morning flight. The hotel was helpful in providing us with packed sandwiches and fruit. The service of the hotel staff was friendly, helpful and responsive. We had slight problem with the air conditioning our room at night but it was attended quickly without much fuss.
Overall strongly recommended",November 2019,The Loft Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294191-d6158709-Reviews-The_Loft_Hotel-Yangon_Rangoon_Yangon_Region.html,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",hotels,5.0,4.5
"One the best hotels in South Delhi, service orientation is superb","I stayed here after several years, though I have visited the bar, coffee shop and restaurants more recently. What impressed me most was the customer service. The room are not very large ( it is one of the older hotels ) though after renovation modern, well furnished, and with usual five star amenities. The free buffet breakfast spread was varied with many options.
The hotel is well located, not to far from the airport or most of the New Delhi’s tourist areas.
A great place to stay and also is nice conference venue",November 2019,Hyatt Regency Delhi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304551-d306931-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,"New Delhi, India",hotels,5.0,4.5

We had the miso soup, the spicy prawn hargao and spicy crisp lotus root as starters and pork belly teriyaki and vegetable udon noodles as part of the main course. The food was consistently very good and service outstanding. The staff when they learnt of a birthday in our group served us a lovely chocolate cake which was complimentary.

It’s the coffee shop of the Taj Colaba,"I have been coming to this restaurant on and off for the last 40 + years. I have not been here for lunch for while and probably came this time too because the specialty restaurants of the Taj were not yet open at 11 am. It is a multi-cuisine all day/night restaurant ( in the old days it was always seen as the coffee shop of the Taj, which it probably still is).

Must visit on a Ladakh trip,"Most travellers on a visit to Ladakh tend to go to Leh and additionally to Nubra Valley and Pangong Tso. I would strongly recommend a trip to see the Dras ( Kargil) War memorial . While the journey is about 6 hours by car there is a lot to see on the way as well. The visit to the Dras War memorial is truly special. It makes us think of how much we owe our Armed Forces. “Never has so much owed by so many to so few.” Its really an amazing place, in a valley surrounded by mountain peaks on all sides. The memorial itself is in a well maintained garden with lovely flowers. It consists of the Amar Jawan Jyoti and the memorial to the soldiers who lost their lives in Kargill war, a museum which tells the story of the war, among other exhibits. There is a recently added sound and light show and a video documentary which is also worth seeing.",September 2019,Dras War Memorial,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g676134-d3710628-Reviews-Dras_War_Memorial-Kargil_Kargil_District_Ladakh_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html,"Kargil, India",attractions,5.0,5.0
Top of the world feeling at Khardungla Pass,"Khardungla Pass is one the highest motorable passages in the world at 17,600 feet. The journey from Leh to Nubra Valley requires you to pass through Khardungla. The journey typically takes about 4 hours but when we went it was snowing and some vehicles started slipping as they were negotiating the last leg of journey to the pass which was covered with snow. As result traffic was held up till each vehicle attached chains to rear wheels. As result the journey took about 2 hours more upto our hotel in Hunder. The pass is in a sense top of the world and when we reached there it was cold and we had tea at the cafe and took photos next to Khardungla Pass signpost.",October 2019,Khardung La,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297624-d1808511-Reviews-Khardung_La-Ladakh_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html,"Ladakh, India",attractions,5.0,4.5
Carved Buddha statue in Mulbekh Monastery is amazing,Just 45 km short of Kargil on the Leh-Kargil road is a place called Mulbekh which is famous for its rock carved Buddha ( reminiscent of Bamiyan Buddha carvings in Afghanistan). It's within a small temple on the left side of the road. The carved Buddha on a rock face is of a standing Maitreya Buddha ( or Future Buddha) and is worth a stop. There are couple of restaurants on the right side of the temple where you can have tea or a soft drink.,October 2019,Mulbekh Monastery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g676134-d3912916-Reviews-Mulbekh_Monastery-Kargil_Kargil_District_Ladakh_Jammu_and_Kashmir.html,"Kargil, India",attractions,5.0,4.0
Amazing Monastery in Lamayuru village,"Around one hour from Alchi on Leh-Kargil road you will reach Lamayuru. The Monastery which is one of the oldest in Ladakh is also quite unique and amazingly perched on a rocks . There is not much walking or climbing involved as vehicles can reach close to the monastery entrance. However, views of the hills/mountains and Moonland from the monastery are quite spectacular. The best photographs of the monastery can be taken from the road just before you drive to top of hill where the monastery is located.

Great place to visit especially in evening,Nubra valley has sand dunes which provides a desert experience.

Definitely Worth visiting this Monastery,"Hemis monastery is one of the oldest monasteries in Ladakh and has existed before the 11th century. It is further down from Tiksey monastery on the Leh- Srinagar road and about 45 km from Leh. Hemis monastery also has a museum as part of its complex which is worth visiting. It has many statues of Buddha in various forms including Maitreya, Tara, etc. There are a number of temples and prayer halls as part of the monastery.

A memorable visit.,"Deskit monastery is one of the top places to visit at Nubra Valley. It is perhaps the oldest and largest monastery in the region. It is about 14 km from Hunder. As with most monasteries, it is at multiple levels on top of a hill. Near the base of the hill is a tall ( 100 ft+) statue of Maitreya Buddha has been completed relatively recently in 2010. In a visit to monastery start with this statue which is amazing.
The approach to the monastery is through a flight of steps to the prayer hall. At each level there are a number of prayer wheels which you should move in the clockwise direction as you enter. The monastery has statue of Cho Rinpoche (Crowned Buddha) in the prayer hall. After visiting the prayer hall don’t forget to rest and have tea with monks before you exit. There are sweet and salty (butter) tea options usually served with biscuits. From higher levels of monastery you can have glorious views of the Nubra valley bellow.
