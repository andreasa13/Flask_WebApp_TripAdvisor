Excellent view of Acropolis over the Monesteraki square,"We went up mainly ro see the view, and it is great. The best in all Athens in my opinion. We would have stayed for drinks but it was very full and there was a line for the tables. So we just took some pictures and left because we didn't want to spend the evening waiting for a table.

So beautiful surroundings and interesting history,"The place is absolutely stunning. The landscape over the valley is so beautiful and the history of the whole archeological site is super interesting.

In winter time admission was only 6 euros per person, very reasonable. It also includes the museum, which is worth visiting as well.

Can be tricky finding a parking spot.

Self guided hike to Alta Canyon viewpoint,"We did a super nice hike to the viewpoint of Alta Canyon. Put Gargia Lodge to your navigator and from there continue to the gravel road for bout 4 km untill you reach the parking lodge. The gravel road is mainly in good condition, at the end there are some potholes, but just drive carefully and you should be fine with a normal car.

The hike to the viewpoint is about 7 km one way. Mostly easy pathway but I would recommend good hiking boots, since the pathway is very muddy and wet in some places. You need to cross 3 streams, for the middle one we devided to take our boots off and hang them on our necks and cross the stream that is about knee high at some points (note, this is in late June, could be more earlier with the melt water). All three crossings have wooden planks but the middle one looked quite difficult to use.

It's mostly gentle ups and downs, before the viewpoint at the very end of the trail there is quite steep downhill on the way to the viewpoint.

Before the steep part at the end, there is picnic table for some snacks.

It took us about 5 hours total with many photo breaks, snacks break and the river crossing operation. Can definitely be done faster too.

Plane was late and toilet was horrible,"The flight was 30 minutes late. Not too bad, but it was a bit confusing, since there was one bus to the plane that left the terminal and returned to the terminal afterwards. There was no reason given of why did it happen. It seemed a bit weird and for someone suffering from fear of flying, that might have been suspicious, if there was something wrong with the plane or something like that. I assume that the plane just was not ready yet, and the staff should have announced that for the passengers.

"Good location, cheap price, othervice very basic/poor quality","You get what you pay for. Although i have stayed in wonderful and good quality hostels with less money...

We had a twin room. The bed and pillow were uncomfortable, the cover was a weird frotee towel, very uncomfortable to use. The toilet is constructed poorly and the water just goes everywhere and the whole floor is wet, and there is nothing to dry it with.

It reads in the booking.com description that there is free public parking at the location. Well yes, if you are willing to drive around for hours and manage to get a free spot by the street in the extremely narrow streets. So no, THERE IS NO FREE PUBLIC PARKING available in this hostel.

There is a kitchen where you can cook food. If you just want a basic and cheap accommodation just to sleep, then this is a good option.

They should deffinitely clean it up! There were trash just floating at the shore, everyhing from shoes to plastic bottles.

Location of this hostel is excellent, it is right next to the main shopping street and the main square so right in the city center, close to old town and the sea.

We were in a private room, which was ok. Sound proofing was horrible, so if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs. The room could have been cleaned better, there were very visible dust balls and some crumbs under the bed. The beds / bedsheets were clean and comfortable enough.

The breakfast was excellent for being so cheap, only 4 euros. Only thing that I missed a bit were some fresh things, like tomatoes, cucumber, salad.. But it was still definitely worth the 4 euros. One thing was very unpleasant though, which was no fault of the hostel: people did not wash the dishes even though it was clearly stated in the signs that everyone should wash their dishes. Some people just don't seem to care, it's a pity.

"A bit hard to get to, excellent beach.","This is one of the most beautiful beaches i have visited! It was a bit difficult to get there but absolutely possible. I made it fine with just sneakers, but i wouldn't recommend flips flops. Hiking boots are not necessary at all. The path is quite rocky and steep at some parts so you need to be carefull but it was not as difficult as i expected having read the comments on tripadvisor. We took the left one of the 3 three paths.

You can get there from Sintra railwaystation by bus number 403 to Capo de Roca. The bus goes in the daytime two times in an hour. It takes about 30 minutes or so and costs 4.20€ per person one way. There is a bus stop right there where the dirt road starts or you can walk from Capo the Roca about 10 minutes. From the road it took us about 30 minutes to reach the beach.

It took us 4 hours to the top and 3 hours to get down, I would say we were going on average speed with some breaks.

Bring warm clothes even in the summer, it is quite chilly at the top.

One thing that was a huge disappointment was the amount of trash in the summit. It a really a shame that some people litter these kinds of wonderful places!

I learnt a lot and got to understand a great deal about Irish history from a very interesting point of view. The museum is excellent, a lot of interestung stuff in there.

A few tips: get there early! They start selling the tickets at 9.30 am and it is first come first served and there are no bookings or online ticket purchase. The prison is only accessible by a guided tours of 35 people that start every 15 minutes. We first went there in the evening and it was sold out so we had to try again next day.
