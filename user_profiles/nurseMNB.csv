Hair in food,Our first experience here was unfortunately horrible. We sat at the bar. Bartender was nice. We had 70 minutes to dine before needing to leave. We ordered drinks and got them then ordered food. Then about 5 minutes later same bartender comes back and asks if we are ready to order food...we say we already did..he is like of right..clearly the order had not been put in. ok so no big deal we keep enjoying our drink. Food takes a long time to arrive.. finally comes! I have about 2 fries and one bite of my burger and discover a dark long wavy hair in my burger (I have short straight blonde hair so I know it’s not mine) I show the bartender and he asks if I want another burger...well yes of course I’m not eating this! My husband has time to finish his whole meal before my new one arrives..and it’s an impossible burger so no fear of it being raw it literally takes 2 minutes to grill. By this time we are about to be late to our plans so I tell him just to box it up because I won’t have tome to eat. It finally arrives. My husband has left to get car and I still have to get bartenders attention to get check. Then to my surprise I’m charged for the burger! I’m sorry but I feel that should of been comped or you should of brought a quick app out for me to eat as I’m starving or even a free drink but nothing!!! For a hair in my food!! I almost said something but I was in a rush and didn’t feel like being rude. Will I give them another chance...not sure....bartender was very nice but that was the only positive.,April 2021,Nic And Norman's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54946-d23128415-Reviews-Nic_And_Norman_s-Chattanooga_Tennessee.html,"Chattanooga, Tennessee",restaurants,1.0,3.5
Best place ever!!,"Review

Wow where do I begin! First off ...stay here!!! And I’ll tell you why,

Nothing is more fun than staying in an airstream where you have the luxury of a hotel room but the rustic outdoors at your doorstep! I fell in love with waking up and sitting outside by the lake with my coffee in hand getting breakfast ready over our outdoor fire pit! Then we would go hiking for the day and come back to sip wine and cook dinner again over the fire! Loved it!! The airstreams are very clean and had all the amenities that you might need, anything else can easily be purchased from the clubhouse!

The staff is the next reason. They are easily available by text and are so nice!! I re-injured a college knee injury and was hobbling around and the staff did all they could to help and make sure we had everything we needed.

Lastly is the location, only about an hour from Yosemite valley and wawona trails! It is also only about 10 minutes from Mariposa which had lots of cute stores and places to eat (if you’re not feeling like cooking!)

Thank you so much to everyone there who made our stay the best it could be considering the Covid shutdowns. I definitely want to return post shut down and maybe in the summer to enjoy that beautiful pool!!",December 2020,AutoCamp Yosemite,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32685-d17154778-Reviews-AutoCamp_Yosemite-Mariposa_California.html,"Mariposa, California",hotels,5.0,4.5
Ok,"There was no real amenities offered due to covid but I still had to pay an amenities fee. I feel it should have been optional, I wanted the amenities listed on website not a bath bomb for $29.

Wow just wow!! Must go!!,What an amazing dining experience we just had!! From the attention to detail to the perfectly balanced flavor combinations everything was amazing! The staff makes you feel like you are dining at a friends house! Their presentation of the food and their passion is what really stands out!

Overall we had a fantastic,"Overall we had a fantastic dinner here! We arrived about 5 minutes before our reservation and were promptly seated at a table literally on the sidewalk with one of us facing a plain wall. There was another area on sidewalk/street that was at least cute and had nice view of the square gardens and then of course all the cute pictures you see on here of Talula’s Garden area. Now I’m not one to complain but on the reservation special details part I put it was our 2 year anniversary dinner. So it was disappointing to literally be sat at the worse table in the place and see others arrive to garden tables.

Ok food. Food was on point! We ordered the brussel sprouts and cornbread sides as appetizers and both were delicious!!! For dinner my husband ordered the fried chicken dinner and loved it. I got the vegetable and grain bowl and it was perfect! Both good sized too!

So again I probably would of stayed as long as reservation allowed and continued to drink but there was no ambience so we got check. Check done and we are literally about to get up when waitress brings us 2 tiny pieces of mocha cake and says oh happy anniversary. Again if this had happened in good timing I would of probably ordered a glass of champagne to go with it but instead I enjoyed the fabulous bite with nothing to wash it down.

So overall I can’t give it a bad review because of all the good food but was not what I would expect from my high bill price. They need to step up their customer service game.",September 2020,Talula's Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60795-d2137068-Reviews-Talula_s_Garden-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Elevated bar food like no other!,"From the minute you walk in you can tell this place is different from all the rest! From the artwork to the decor everything is well thought out and makes an impression!

Next comes the cocktails! These are not just your typical, weak bar cocktails, these are hand crafted, strong but perfectly balanced, delicious cocktails! Their beer menu is also quite extensive and has great variety! We tried several both on tap and cans throughout the night!

Now let’s talk food! This is elevated bar food at its best! We started with the Duckfat Fried Brussels, Cheese Curds, Elote, and Fried Deviled Eggs! Can I just say I did not know a deviled egg could get any better but then I tried this! It was amazing! As were the other apps! Loved the use of duck fat in the Brussels! I could of just had those as my dinner!

Next up were the mains! My husband got the Drunkin Spinalis and I got the Veggie Plate! Chef had me at goat cheese grits and it did not disappoint! I tried my husbands spinalis and it was perfected cooked medium rare and was melt in your mouth delicious!

I’d come nightly if I didn’t live in Chattanooga! If you live anywhere close to this place go there now!",August 2020,Pineapple Ink Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29212-d21167789-Reviews-Pineapple_Ink_Tavern-Augusta_Georgia.html,"Augusta, Georgia",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Best service for ATV rental!,Rented an ATV for the day and they were so nice! Our hotel was very close by so we just walked there to pick up our ATV. The guy was very nice with the whole rental process and even gave us a couple extra hours in the 1 day rental.

AMAZING!!,"This place was the best place we ate in Mykonos! The food was amazing! the service was amazing! The wine was amazing! The view of the sunset was AMAZING! The only thing I would say that took away from the experience is that when you sit outside in the alley tourists are constantly walking but to take pictures and go down below of the rocks and take more pictures and black your view that you are paying A LOT for. I wish the restaurant could block off their alley for customers only. The balconies require a full meal (2 apps, 2 entrees, drinks) hind site I wish I had asked if we could do one app and one dessert and that count but I said that the alley was fine but the balcony would have been worth it to keep the people walking by you out of the picture.

You will be STUFFED after this tour!!!,"Great street food tour where you will get more like 4-5 meals not 4-5 street samples!! It was just my husband and I on the tour so we ended up having a private tour! Our guide was very nice and told us a lot about Naples and its history not just about food! All the food stops were delicious! Only negative I would say is the day before the tour you get your location confirmation and it says do you want to add the drink package. I was confused because in the description it says food and drinks but only 1 drink is included. If you purchase the drink package for 16 euro pp extra you get an additional 2 drinks. We purchased the extra thinking it would be fun cocktails or wine pairings but basically you just get a house beer or wine at 2 of the stops, which probably cost about 4euro each so you kind of feel ripped off. But otherwise it was great so I still have it 5 stars.",October 2019,Naples Street Food Tour - Do Eat Better Experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187785-d13503455-Naples_Street_Food_Tour_Do_Eat_Better_Experience-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campani.html,"Naples, Italy",activities,5.0,5.0
