Great Communicator and Fantastic Guide,"From the time that we booked Cara, we were excited with her excellent communication with us in order to learn more about what we were interested in for Yellowstone.

Overall, our experience with Cara was wonderful. When we met she had amazing hot chocolate, tea, and coffee for us. From there we communicated via radio (during COVID) as we drove to the various sights. She had 3 fantastic spotting scopes which allowed us to see plenty of wildlife. But, the best thing was being able to tell that she truly cared about the animals. Whenever we saw one we did not know who was more excited (Cara or us). Lastly, she brings her own camera (see attached photos) and will take both videos and photos of animals for you.

Was our best guide in Yellowstone and highly recommend.",August 2020,In Our Nature Guiding Services,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45184-d10162658-Reviews-In_Our_Nature_Guiding_Services-Gardiner_Montana.html,"Gardiner, Montana",attractions,5.0,5.0
Amazing Time,"Stayed here for 5 nights during my graduate trip celebration and was treated to some of the best food ever by Chef Tim and great hospitality by Meg, Shawn, and Josh.

Amazing Fishing and Wonderful Hosts,"This was our first time to Montana and mostly stayed at the Madison River Lodge. Overall, the experience was phenomenal with excellent communication from Montana Anglers and fantastic guides who kept us constantly busy catching fish and were enjoyable to talk with during the trip.

"Amazing View, Hot-tub, and Beds","This was my family's first time staying in Breckenridge and Gold Point was amazing. Waking-up and seeing the mountains across the way and then finishing the day by relaxing in a hot-tub and seeing the same view was amazing. The bus was easy to take into town, but we mainly drove, since one of us could not ski. The beds were very comfy and the kitchen had enough supplies for all 5 of us.

As an ending note: there is a sign to use the second turn-in lane to access the check-in",March 2020,Gold Point Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33327-d498860-Reviews-Gold_Point_Resort-Breckenridge_Colorado.html,"Breckenridge, Colorado",hotels,5.0,4.5

Great AA Ice Cream,Always enjoy stopping at Blank Slate and having one of their original flavors of ice cream. Even without ordering a waffle cone you can get the off-shoots of them to taste.

Tour and Samples,Very friendly staff to welcome you at the door and bought a coffee before the tour. The tour was very informative and interesting. Seeing the actual machines and people working was fantastic. There is no actual production on the weekends. After the tour stopped by the shop for some samples and buying more chocolate. Butlers chocolate is top-notch and better than Belgian or Switz chocolates that I have had abroad.,May 2019,Butlers Chocolate Experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d2056323-Reviews-Butlers_Chocolate_Experience-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great for a Quick Visit,"A very nice way to spend an hour or two of your time in the heart of Edinburgh. They have a few famous paintings, the big deer one (very technical) and has one of my favorite paintings of flowers (also attached).

Great Tour Guide and Sights,"A very friendly tour guide who was actually English, but has lived in Scotland for the last several years. One of the highlights of the tour was stopping on the side of the road and feeding some of the special cows carrots.

Great Views and Easy to Read Signs,"Acropolis was cool to see and had no wait for tickets in early May. The signs are in Greek and English so if you walk around and just read those then you will easily understand the sites.

Best Night Life in Santorini,Probably one of the best bars I have been to in my life. If you are looking for a great drink deal before dinner (2 drinks for 12 euros) or the best late night-life in Santorini then look no further. The drinks and hookah here are amazing. The staff are also very considerate and do a great job overall. My friends and I sat at a table for 2 hours on Saturday night and loved it.,May 2019,Two Brothers Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482942-d6158758-Reviews-Two_Brothers_Bar-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
The View,"Beautiful view. If you can grab a table on the top, then the view from there is spectacular. A fantastic way to watch the sunset. The waitstaff is also kind.

"Location, Location, Location","Was truly an oasis in the town of Fira. While I was there the reception was under construction, but they were able to take my bags before the room was available and then delivered them to the room when we checked-in.

Better than the Lourve,"This museum I had 0 expectations before going in. The artwork and artifacts were amazing quality. The audio guide was very helpful as well as the tablets on the benches.

Amazing Time,"This castle was absolutely amazing. We were a little late for our check-in, but called ahead and it worked out fine. We stayed in one of the suites and it was very comfy. The beds have been the comfiest on the trip so far. The morning views from the castle were amazing. We headed downstairs for a great breakfast and then was given a tour of the castle. The history behind the place was very interesting.

If you love peace and quiet, but still an amazing place to stay, this is right for you.

Tip: since this place isn’t an all inclusive with a restaurant, you can stop in town 10 minutes north of the place and grab some food to either cook up or take-out and eat at the castle, since the kitchen is very nice.",March 2019,Wilton Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g319787-d9560704-Reviews-Wilton_Castle-Enniscorthy_County_Wexford.html,"Enniscorthy, Ireland",hotels,5.0,5.0
Fantastic Walk,"We stayed at the Causeway Hotel which was very pleasant, so it was easy to walk over in the morning.
