A Seattle Must-See,"We pre-ordered our tickets online for the first time slot available & were still met by a line upon our arrival – It moved fairly quickly though. As first time visitors, we weren’t sure what was revamped as part of the renovation vs. what was “original,” but we enjoyed the rotating view & the see-through glass floor. As expected, the views from the top were fabulous in some directions, but clouded over in other directions. If you have time to grab a drink, definitely do so!",October 2019,Skip the Line: Seattle Space Needle Observation Deck Admission Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g60878-d11987993-Skip_the_Line_Seattle_Space_Needle_Observation_Deck_Admission_Ticket-Seattle_Washin.html,"Seattle, Washington",activities,4.0,4.5
Top-Notch Service,"We used Eudaimonia Private Tours for a day trip to Mycenae, Epidaurus, & Nafplio (from Athens) & had a great experience! We booked directly through their website approximately 2 months in advance & had great communication via email prior to our arrival.

On the morning of the tour, Nikos was promptly waiting for us in the lobby of our hotel. We were on the road early in order to reach Mycenae right as it opened, however we did stop for a quick look at the Corinth canal since it was along the way. Once we arrived, Nikos fetched our entrance tickets, showed us where to meet him once we were finished, then sent us on our way. We did a self-guided tour (via our Rick Steves book), which was enjoyable as it was not yet crowded, then dropped by the museum on our way out. We spent a total of about 1.5 hours there before continuing on to my favorite stop, Nafplio. Nikos dropped us off at the top of Palamidi Fortress to explore (one of the highlights of the day, in my opinion!), then met us at the bottom of the 999 steps to take us to a delicious, local lunch. He had been discreetly asking what we liked to eat/drink throughout the day, so when we arrived at the restaurant, he knew exactly what to order us – I wish I remembered the name of this place because everything was phenomenal. We raved about the olive oil on the Greek salad, so Nikos unexpectedly went to the kitchen & came back with a bottle for us! We then continued on to our last stop, Epidaurus, which was surprisingly not crowded at all. We spent a total of about 1.5 hours there exploring the small museum & walking the steps of the stunning theater before starting the journey back to Athens.

We also used Eudaimonia for a private transfer from the airport to our hotel upon our arrival in Athens, as well as from our hotel back to the airport upon our departure. Unfortunately, I can’t remember the gentleman’s name, but he was friendly & arrived on time on both occasions, including a 5:25AM pickup to transport us to the airport – The van was clean, spacious, & way better than taking taxi!

We’re so grateful for the hospitality Eudaimonia Private Tours showed us during our time in Athens & would highly recommend them to any couples/families looking for top-notch service & an unforgettable experience!",May 2019,Mycenae/Epidaurus/Nafplio Private Trip from Athens/Nafplio Including GREAT Lunch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12469681-Mycenae_Epidaurus_Nafplio_Private_Trip_from_Athens_Nafplio_Including_GREAT_Lunch-A.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
Quick Stop,"Whether you’re staying in Princeville or you’re en route to Hanalei, the lookout is a convenient & quick stop located just past Foodland – The view is stunning! It will often times get clouded in due to the rainy weather, but if you catch it at the right time (after the rain), TONS of waterfalls can be visible. As posted on the signs, don’t climb over the guardrail. :)",December 2019,Hanalei Valley Lookout,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60612-d131419-Reviews-Hanalei_Valley_Lookout-Hanalei_Kauai_Hawaii.html,"Kauai, Hawaii",attractions,4.0,4.5
Frequent Customers :),"As frequent Kauai/Princeville visitors, we’ve dined/gotten drinks at Kalypso’s dozens of times, with the most recent occasion(s) being this past December – We stopped by 3 separate times during our 1-week stay, LOL. The atmosphere is very laid back, with a majority of the staff being friendly & welcoming. The open air indoor/outdoor seating is great when there’s a breeze coming through, but can also be uncomfortable when it’s hot & humid. (I don’t think the restaurant has A/C.) Our first visit was specifically for lunch/to watch Sunday football (I swear this is the only place on the North side of the island that has a football package!) in which the hostess was super accommodating , asking what game we were looking for & making sure to seat us where we could see the TV. During our second & third visits, we opted to sit at the bar as we just wanted to grab a couple of drinks. Happy Hour or not, it’s usually pretty crowded, but then again, there are limited bar options in the vicinity. As far as the food goes, the Kahlua Pork Quesadilla & the Coconut Shrimp are among our top favorites, although I don’t think we’ve ever gotten a dish we didn’t like. If you’re looking for a casual bite to eat, give Kalypso’s a try!",December 2019,Kalypso Island Bar and Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60612-d519189-Reviews-Kalypso_Island_Bar_and_Grill-Hanalei_Kauai_Hawaii.html,"Kauai, Hawaii",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Pleasant Stay,"After debating between the King George & Hotel Grande Bretagne, we ultimately chose the latter for our 4-night stay in Athens. Upon our arrival, I was a bit irked to see 2 large tour busses out front, but despite being busy inside, we didn’t have to wait an extended amount of time before reaching the check-in counter.

Our room was on the 4th floor & was plenty spacious for our needs. There was only 1 luggage rack, but I can’t say it was that big of a deal because we never phoned for another. (We ended up just using the ledge of the window, hah.) The bathroom was also a generous size, with plenty of counter space. The shower was definitely on the smaller side, but the separate soaking tub made up for it. I prefer to bring my own toiletries, but I must admit I really enjoyed the fragrance of the items provided by the hotel. There were a few signs of wear & tear, such as the damaged weather stripping lining our door, but overall we enjoyed the room setup & decor.

The location of the hotel was ideal for exploring the city, with many of the main tourist attractions within walking distance. The Arch of Hadrian/Temple of Zeus was a 5-minute walk away, with the Acropolis being a 15-minute walk, & the Ancient Agora being just beyond that. There were endless shops & restaurants in the vicinity, which we definitely took advantage of. We also felt safe walking the area at night.

We had minimal interaction with the staff during our stay. We were rarely acknowledged when making our way through the lobby, but perhaps they thought we were associated with the conference/event being held at the hotel & not actual guests. Even upon check out, we were barely spoken to – We weren’t even asked the standard “How was your stay?” question. (I’d like to give the gentleman the benefit of the doubt though as it was 5:20AM when we checked out.) We did end up needing to borrow an umbrella from the bellhop, who was very kind & helpful. & Although we never ran into housekeeping, they did an excellent job cleaning up & turning down our room each night.

All in all, we had a pleasant stay. My only complaint, if you could even call it that, was the lack of acknowledgement by the staff in passing. The hotel delivered in all areas, however if we were to find ourselves in Athens again, I think we’d like to try the King George next before opting to return to the Grand Bretagne.",May 2019,"Hotel Grande Bretagne, A Luxury Collection Hotel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d198715-Reviews-Hotel_Grande_Bretagne_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Views/Ambiance Outweigh the Food,"We knew we wanted to cap off our 4-night stay at Hotel Grand Bretagne with dinner at the GB Roof Garden, so we inquired about reservations upon check-in. Unfortunately, they only had 5PM available, but of course, we took it. The restaurant was rather empty when we arrived & was never actually full at any point during our meal. We were thrilled to see they served wine from a local Santorini vineyard we had previously visited & ended up ordering a bottle with our appetizer & another with dessert. We had a cheese platter & a Greek salad to start, both of which were good, but nothing special. For our mains, I had a pasta dish while my husband had some sort of daily special (I forget what it was). The portions were small but expected as we had read countless reviews prior to booking. The service was on the slower side, but we didn’t mind as we wanted to see the Acropolis light up after sundown. (The outside tables were not in use due to the rain that day, so our view was unobstructed & amazing.) At one point, we noticed what appeared to be a manager making his way through the tables, asking guests how everything was, etc. Oddly enough, he skipped our table, which really left a bad taste in my mouth. (We were the youngest couple in the restaurant by easily 10 years – Coincidence?) All in all, our meal topped $400USD, with the views/ambiance far outweighing the food. We enjoyed our time, but my husband has no desire to return for anything other than drinks at the bar.",May 2019,GB Roof Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1048185-Reviews-GB_Roof_Garden-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Unforgettable,"Navagio Beach was on the top of our to-do list while on Zakynthos, so when our villa informed us the waters were too rough for tour companies to go out, we were pretty disappointed. On our way to the lookout point, we decided to stop by Potamitis Brothers anyway, just to be sure. We pulled up to the windmill/restaurant where we were met by a worker who confirmed tours were not going out that day. He assured us that boats would be running the following day though as the weather was expected to improve, so we confirmed we’d be back the following day at opening. (I even sent an email later that evening to double confirm & received an immediate response reassuring us the weather reports were still looking good.)

We returned to the same spot as promised, however I was slightly concerned when no other cars were in the parking lot. We were told the tours would be leaving from the dock around the bend (whew), so we jumped in the car & made our way over. But again, I became concerned by the complete lack of cars at the correct dock – Not even a worker was in sight. We waited about 10 minutes (thinking we were stood up, hah) when suddenly we heard a boat coming around the corner. Since no one else was there, the captain said we could wait until more tourists showed up, or we could pay extra for a “private” tour – Of course we opted for the latter, which ended up being the best decision.

The ride out to the beach was about 35 minutes, with stunning scenery the entire way. When we arrived, we were absolutely shocked to see we were the only ones there! We got as close as possible, then jumped out & waded our way to the shore. We were there for about 10 minutes before another tour boat could be seen in the distance, but to have the beach to ourselves (even just for 10 minutes!) was truly unforgettable. On our way back to port, we stopped at the Blue Caves, although they didn’t compare to what we experienced at Navagio. Our captain was so great throughout the trip – We felt safe the entire time & he constantly offered to take our photos. We are so thankful for the experience Potamitis Brothers gave us & would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a memorable time!",May 2019,Potamitis Brothers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1581383-d7964041-Reviews-Potamitis_Brothers-Volimes_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Descent Option for Dinner,"My husband & I chose to dine at Orizodes due to its close proximity to Emerald Villas & Suites. The restaurant had a modern/contemporary feel & appeared to be well-kept. (They were also doing construction on a new sky bar/patio, which looked very nice.) We were seated & serviced immediately as there were only 2 other parties present. The menu was moderately priced & consisted of typical Greek dishes. The portions weren’t huge, but were just large enough to generate leftovers to take back to our villa. Overall, it was a descent option given the lack of restaurants in the area – We enjoyed our both our food & the views of the ocean from our table.",May 2019,Orizodes Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635865-d10351526-Reviews-Orizodes_Restaurant-Agios_Nikolaos_Volimes_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Mediocre,"After stopping by Makris Gialos Beach, we thought it’d be nice to have a late lunch at Klontiraki Fish Tavern due to its favorable location & views. We clearly dropped in during a down time as no other guests were present & the entire wait/cook staff was just sitting around. We enjoyed the tzatziki, but were not overly impressed by the entrees. Apparently the waiter mis-heard my husband’s order (or maybe my husband didn’t speak clear enough), so he unexpectedly received a pork chop. He didn’t feel like complaining, so he just rolled with it. Both of our dishes (I had chicken souvlaki) were on the dry side & my french fries were rather soggy. Even as the only customers, the service was just mediocre. Given the opportunity, we would not return.",May 2019,Klontiraki Fish Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1581383-d11708104-Reviews-Klontiraki_Fish_Tavern-Volimes_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Descent Wine,"We found Callinico Winery after doing a quick Google search for local wineries on the island & decided to drop by. There was a large wine tour group at the tasting counter when we arrived, so we opted to explore the museum until they left. We ended up sampling just 2 wines before settling for a glass & heading out to the patio. The worker seemed a bit irked at the tour group that had just departed (from what we overheard, the guide didn’t provide advanced notification that he was bringing a large group through), so we didn't want to take up too much more of her time. Overall, the wine was decent & we enjoyed the outdoor setting.",May 2019,Callinico Winery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1093546-d2205167-Reviews-Callinico_Winery-Alykes_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Enjoyable Experience,"We stopped at Goumas Winery on a whim after seeing signs along the main highway directing the way. (We actually missed a turn, but eventually ended up finding it, LOL.) When we arrived, we were surprised to find we were the only visitors. The property was very quaint & after receiving a quick tour of the grounds along with a bit of history, we were lead to the tasting room. We tried 5 different wines & were even given a small plate of nibbles to pair with the tastings. The experience was intimate & very enjoyable as we learned so much directly from the owner. We purchased 2 bottles to bring back to the States, although I wish we had purchased more!",May 2019,Goumas Estate - Art & Wine Winery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g5105567-d8483279-Reviews-Goumas_Estate_Art_Wine_Winery-Maries_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great Beach to Walk Along,"It was quite the drive from Agios Nikolaos, but we made the journey to Gerakas Beach due to its rave reviews. Accessing the beach may be challenging for some as the only options down/up were sandy steps or a rickety, wooden ramp that looked like it was under construction (but wasn't). Even on a cloudy day, the water looked clear & inviting. We walked along a majority of the shoreline (it was a bit too cold to swim), which was lined with dozens of chairs, however it didn’t appear any services were up & running – Perhaps because it was still “shoulder” season. As we made our way back towards the parking lots, we stopped at the small turtle resource/rehab center. There were no turtles present at the time, but it was still educational & worth the walk-through.",May 2019,Gerakas Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g776001-d4885489-Reviews-Gerakas_Beach-Vasilikos_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Disappointing,"I don’t recall how I came across Emerald Villas & Suites, but after researching countless options, I do recall repeatedly going back to it as my #1 choice. When we finally decided to book, I was devastated to learn the Honeymoon Suite was unavailable for 1 of the 5 nights of our trip, but after temporarily reconsidering, we ultimately booked the next best option – A deluxe villa.

Our arrival seemed to catch the staff off guard. We did arrive prior to the check-in time, however they acted as if they weren’t expecting us to show up at all – Apparently they had reached out via email to confirm our arrival, but never received a response due to an incorrect email address on file. (For that, I blame our travel agent.) Since our villa wasn’t quite ready yet, they sent us down to Orizodes for a drink & phoned once everything was all set. (They even picked up the tab, which was a nice gesture.) Upon returning, we were shown to Villa #6, where we were given a tour & some general information re: hot water, electricity, etc.

To be frank, the property left us almost speechless, but not in a good way. (Mind you, we had just spent 4 nights at the Hotel Grande Bretagne in Athens.) The musty/stuffy smell, the furniture, the creaky floor – It really reminded me of a grandma’s house. The villa itself had so much potential, but was showing major wear & tear. (There was literally a pipe sticking up out of the floor with tape covering the top..) A previous review had mentioned smart TVs & the ability to stream Netflix, but that was not the case in our villa – We had a maximum of 7 channels along with a stereo that looked like it was straight out of the ‘90s. Additionally, the wifi signal was not strong enough to reach the upper floor & the master bedroom mattress was terribly uncomfortable. On a positive note, the kitchen was well-stocked with utensils, etc., & the patio boasted ample space with plenty of seating for both dining & lounging by the pool.

We saw the staff fairly often as the front desk/office was right next to our villa, but we only interacted on a few occasions. We turned down housekeeping the first day, so they absolutely insisted they service the villa the following morning. We’re tidy people & had extra/clean linens, so we didn’t think it was necessary, but we obliged anyway. Anastasia was friendly & although she was unsure about most of our excursion questions, she willingly researched our inquiries & would report back with the answers later in the day. We had read so many great reviews about Angelos but unfortunately, he was not on-site during our stay.

The location is a bit removed from the busy, tourist-filled towns, but we enjoyed that aspect of it. A rental car is an absolute must. The villas are approximately a 50-minute drive to/from the airport, however they’re only a 15-minute walk to the nearest town/port, Agios Nikolaos – Dining options are limited though & there’s only a small (overpriced) grocery store. Additionally, there were few street lights along the road/highway, so once the sun went down, we were left to walk home in the dark. There are several restaurants in the surrounding area (including Orizodes) that offer delivery, but we didn’t utilize any of them.

It’s disappointing to have to write this review as I had such high expectations for the property & amenities, but needless to say, we were not impressed. They are clearly putting all of their efforts & funds into the newer units/suites & while it’s a great accomplishment to be able to expand, it’s also unfortunate for those who get stuck in the “original,” worn-down villas that are in desperate need of a face lift.",May 2019,Emerald Villas & Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635865-d638111-Reviews-Emerald_Villas_Suites-Agios_Nikolaos_Volimes_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",hotels,3.0,5.0
One of Our Favorite Restaurants,"While searching for restaurants in the Agios Nikolaos area, I stumbled across the highly-rated Nobelos Bio. Since it was just a short walk away from our accommodation, my husband & I figured it was worth a try. Reservations were recommended, however given the fact that we were visiting during the “shoulder” season, we took our chances without one. It ended up working out as no other guests were there when we arrived. The grounds were beautiful with a lot of prime, waterfront tables but due to the wind, we opted to sit on the small balcony (next to the indoor seating) since it was semi-shielded. Our waitress was extremely kind & attentive, helping with wine recommendations, etc. The Greek salad was one of the best we had eaten, & similar to our entrees, they didn’t skimp when it came to portions. We enjoyed ourselves & the food so much that we decided to return a few nights later for our final dinner on Zakynthos. We had the same sweet waitress but the second time around, we were able to snag a waterfront table as the weather was cooperating nicely. Nobelos Bio was one of our favorite restaurants during our 2-week trip throughout Greece – Great food, atmosphere, & service!",May 2019,Nobelos Bio Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635865-d3250978-Reviews-Nobelos_Bio_Restaurant-Agios_Nikolaos_Volimes_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Laidback Atmosphere,"My husband & I wanted a quick/casual bite to eat & after walking past To Nisi, we decided to try it out. We were the only guests in the restaurant for a majority of our meal, so the service was super quick & friendly. The menu boasted quite a few options, however it seemed as though they were not carrying all items due to it being the “shoulder” season. I ultimately chose a pizza (really Greek, I know), while my husband ordered some sort of meatballs. Although the food was just average, we enjoyed the laidback atmosphere along with the view of Agios Nikolaos Beach.",May 2019,To Nisi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189462-d10134786-Reviews-To_Nisi-Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Pretty Interesting,"As part of a “package” tour, we visited the Blue Caves on our way back from Navagio Beach (via Potamitis Brothers). We were able to enter about 5-6 caves, with some being a tight squeeze & others being rather large, although after the first few, they all started to look the same. They were pretty interesting to see however if they hadn’t been included in our Navagio excursion, I doubt we would’ve paid or gone out of our way to see them.",May 2019,Blue Caves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g6772390-d3453889-Reviews-Blue_Caves-Korithi_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Absolutely Stunning,"As an obvious must-see, we ventured out to Navagio Beach (via Potamitis Brothers) early one morning. It was approximately 30 minutes (one-way) from the port, which was supposedly the closest port you could leave out of. The beach was absolutely stunning – No photo could truly do it justice! The section that suffered the landslide/collapse was still very evident, however at the time of our visit, we were told officials were still ironing out the new safety rules/restrictions. It was a bit cold to swim, but we braved the water in order to wade up onto shore. We were lucky enough to be the only ones there (but not for long!), which made for an unforgettable experience.",May 2019,Navagio Beach (Shipwreck Beach),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g7777607-d671779-Reviews-Navagio_Beach_Shipwreck_Beach-Anafonitria_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful & Clear Water,"We briefly stopped off at Makris Gialos Beach as it was fairly close to our accommodations. Parking seemed to be limited (non-existent, really), but we followed in the footsteps of other beach-goers & just parked on the side of the highway. Unfortunately, it was a bit too cold to swim, but the water was beautiful & clear. The sand was more pebble-like, so if you prefer finer sand, this may not be the beach for you. Overall, it was very pretty & nicely kept!",May 2019,Makris Gialos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1429668-d8491035-Reviews-Makris_Gialos_Beach-Makris_Gialos_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Delicious!,"We had walked by Barbadimos almost daily, but finally decided to try it out after receiving a recommendation from a tour guide we had used. We were lucky enough to be seated immediately without a reservation (on a Friday night, too!), & were serviced shortly thereafter. From the drinks to the appetizers to the main entrée (we shared one as our guide had suggested, due to the large portions), everything was delicious. The service was friendly & timely, despite a very large party sitting upstairs.

"Didn't ""Wow"" Us","As a recommended restaurant in our Rick Steves guide book, we decided to dine at Tzitzikas kai Mermigas upon our arrival in Athens. We opted to sit outside as I love to people watch, but we were slightly disappointed to find our view of the street was mostly obstructed by the plastic guard they have surrounding the patio. Service was a bit on the slower side, but we chalked that up to the culture. The wine was tasty, but the food really didn’t “wow” us – It did the job at a decent price though. With so many other options in the area, I doubt we would return if visiting Athens again.",May 2019,Tzitzikas kai Mermigas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d799151-Reviews-Tzitzikas_kai_Mermigas-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Nothing Special,"My husband & I dined at Athinaikon one evening due to its convenient proximity to our hotel. We arrived fairly early (by Greek standards), so we were seated immediately without a reservation.

The wine-by-the-glass selection was quite extensive & although I don’t recall the exact ones we tried, I do recall them all being very tasty!

Easy Self-Guided Tour,"After dealing with the massive crowds at the Acropolis, our visit to the Ancient Agora was surprisingly pleasant. We arrived first thing in the morning, proceeded to skip the small line (we had combo tickets from the Acropolis), & found the grounds nearly empty. (There had been light rain on & off throughout the morning, so that might’ve contributed to the lack of tourists.) With the help of our Rick Steves guide book, we did a self-guided tour, which was the perfect amount of history/information for us. It was fairly quiet everywhere we explored & with the surrounding greenery, we almost forgot we were in the middle of a busy city. Overall, we had an educational but laidback experience, which was a welcoming change from the other attractions we had visited.",May 2019,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Hordes of People,"We arrived shortly before opening to purchase tickets & were not surprised to see a line already formed. We utilized one of the side entrances though, so with only about 10 parties ahead of us, the line moved rather quickly. Once we entered & made our way around to the main entrance, we were met by hordes of people pushing their way up the steps. With our Rick Steves guide book in tow, we decided to take on the monument without a tour guide. (& I’m glad we went this route as being in a tour group just looked like a hassle.) We found it fairly easy to navigate around, & while there were informative plaques throughout, we opted for the descriptions in our book instead. The massive crane inside the main structure was an unfortunate eyesore, but I believe they are currently working on a preservation/restoration project. The views of the city were spectacular though. The ground was very uneven throughout & even slippery in some places, so be sure to wear appropriate shoes. I’d also recommend bringing water & patience as it warms up early in the morning & the number of clueless tourists is absurd.",May 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Convenient for an Overnight Layover,"We stayed at the Sofitel Athens for 1 night & found it to be sufficient. The location was excellent, just a short walk away from both the arrival & departure terminals, & the check-in process was a breeze. (I believe the hotel was actually fully booked as we watched the front desk turn away multiple customers.) Both the room & bathroom were plenty spacious as well as clean. We debated ordering room service, but ultimately ended up going down to the on-site restaurant as we assumed it’d be quicker – Unfortunately, we were mistaken. They were clearly short-staffed & what we had hoped to be a quick bite to eat was anything but that. We returned the following morning as breakfast was included within our rate & while we did have a better experience, I mostly attribute it to the fact that it was a self-serve buffet. Despite the slowness at the restaurant & the semi-over-priced room rates, we would return if we ever have an overnight layer in Athens in the future – The property is well-kept & the convenience factor is just too good to pass up.",May 2019,Sofitel Athens Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562627-d285733-Reviews-Sofitel_Athens_Airport-Spata_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Spata, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Nice Photo, but Nothing More","We stumbled upon the Arch of Hadrian while walking between our hotel & the Acropolis & were surprisingly underwhelmed.

"Take the Steps Down, Not Up :)","My husband & I visited Palamidi Castle while on a day tour from Athens (via Eudaimonia Private Tours) & absolutely loved it. If we had been staying in Nafplio, we would’ve taken the 999 steps up to the top, but in the interest of time, we opted for our driver to drop us off at the top entrance so that we could take the steps down instead. Aside from being just plain cool, the castle itself was in excellent condition. With the help of our Rick Steves guidebook, we did a self-guided tour through the fortress, which was very informative. Of course, the views (in literally every direction), were spectacular. Around mid-afternoon, we started our decent down the stairs. Whether you’re going up or down, be sure to bring plenty of water as it can get pretty warm. We would highly recommend visiting Palamidi Castle (& Nafplio in general) as it was definitely one of the highlights of our entire trip to Greece!",May 2019,Palamidi Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g319780-d2218054-Reviews-Palamidi_Castle-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing!,"My husband & I visited the Great Theatre of Epidaurus while on a day tour from Athens (via Eudaimonia Private Tours) & thoroughly enjoyed our time spent here. Since we came upon the museum first, we decided to do a quick walk through. While it was not anything extravagant, it did house a few interesting & informative pieces. By the time we made our way to the theatre, we were pleasantly surprised to see the lack of tourists. I’m not sure if it was due to the time of day (late afternoon) or the fact that we were visiting during “shoulder” season (maybe a combination of both?), but either way, it was nice to have it almost to ourselves! After climbing all the way up to the top, we were met with both shade & the most stunning views of the surrounding mountains. (You really can clearly hear the voices of those at the bottom speaking at a normal volume.) It’s amazing to think the theatre is still in use today!",May 2019,The Great Theatre of Epidaurus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g815573-d198893-Reviews-The_Great_Theatre_of_Epidaurus-Epidavros_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Epidavros, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Arrive Early,"While on a day tour from Athens (via Eudaimonia Private Tours), my husband & I spent approximately 1.5 hours exploring Mycenae. With the help of our Rick Steves book, we did a self-guided tour (although I believe there are guided tours available) up the hill through the ruins. We arrived just shortly after opening, which meant we could enjoy ourselves (& the Lion Gate!) without being surrounded by hordes of people. When it comes to visualizing what the grounds looked like all those years ago, you definitely need to use your imagination – structurally, little remains – however the museum does have a neat display to help you if needed. The museum (included within the price of an entrance ticket) was very well done with a large amount of preserved items from the site. We would highly recommend going as early as possible to beat the big tour busses/groups!",May 2019,Archaeological Site Mycenae,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189486-d522565-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_Mycenae-Mycenae_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Mycenae, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Interesting to See,"We made a quick 10-minute stop at the Corinth Canal while on our way from Athens to Nafplio. It was still fairly early, so not many tourists were around yet, which was a nice perk. Other than walking over the canal & snapping a few pictures, there wasn't much else to do. (& Unfortunately, there were no boats passing through while we were there.) Although it was interesting to see, it's not something I'd recommend going out of your way for.",May 2019,Corinth Canal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1188932-d2454053-Reviews-Corinth_Canal-Isthmia_Loutraki_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Isthmia, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Perfect Stay,"My husband & I recently stayed at Anteliz Suites for 4 nights & thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. I had emailed with Antony prior to our arrival requesting a private airport transfer, which was waiting for us as promised when we arrived at JTR. & Even though our flight didn't land until well past 10PM (the night before Easter), the bellhops were there to greet & escort us to the hotel.

Elizabeth checked us in & took us to our room, where she showed us where everything was kept, how to open/lock the shutters, how to order breakfast for the following morning, etc. We stayed in the Jacuzzi Suite & although it was right up against the main walkway (all of the Suites with private pools are), it wasn’t loud at all. The room was clean & spacious with plenty of natural light. The bathroom boasted double sinks & ample countertop space, which is huge for me as I travel with a lot of toiletries (LOL). The only design flaw I noticed was the shower entrance – It was very easy for water to splash out onto the floor, but it wasn’t a major issue.

The property/grounds were kept immaculate & all of the staff members we encountered were friendly & willing to assist in any way possible. The location was ideal, being just a short walk to many shops/restaurants as well as a 10-minute drive to/from the airport. The breakfast included with the room rate was also a great perk. We opted to have our breakfast on the terrace every morning as the view was just stunning. (Otherwise, you can have it delivered to your room.) Although the breakfast choices didn’t change daily, there was a large enough variety of options to not have to eat the same thing twice.

Our time spent at Anteliz Suites was perfect & was a great way to kick off our 2-week honeymoon in Greece. I’m not sure if we’ll ever return to Santorini (there are so many other Greek islands to see!), but if we do, we wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.",April 2019,Anteliz Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d267749-Reviews-Anteliz_Suites-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Worth It,"My husband & I heard great feedback about this 5-mile one-way walk/hike & were excited to conquer it during our visit to Santorini – In short, it did not disappoint. We started in Fira as that was where we were staying, but you can start in either town. Our hotel was actually located right on the “trail” however just beyond our hotel, the path had been damaged/closed off due to landslides that had occurred earlier in the spring. After a slight detour, we were back on the main path headed towards Oia. There were small signs marking the way, but they were often hard to see. Some sections were steep (climbing the Acropolis felt like nothing after doing this!), but it wasn’t dangerous at any point, & the views were so worth it. It took us a total of 3 hours from start to finish, including all water (& picture) breaks. We started around 10AM & it didn’t take long before it started warming up. I would definitely suggest bringing extra sunscreen (we both ended up a little sunburnt as we only applied sunscreen once, before leaving the hotel) & plenty of water as there really isn't anywhere to purchase any once you're in between towns. After spending some time in Oia, we opted to take a cab back to Fira, which I assume is what most people do. If you have limited time on the island &/or are on the fence about doing this, I would highly recommend reshuffling your schedule to squeeze it in – It’s definitely worth it!",April 2019,Hiking Trail Fira - Oia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d2368798-Reviews-Hiking_Trail_Fira_Oia-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Loved Our Experience,"While searching for things to do on Santorini, my husband came across Santorini Wine Adventures, so we decided to book a half-day wine tour. (Unfortunately, the Sunset Tour wasn’t operating yet.) We booked through their website (about 6 weeks in advance), which was simple & quick, & we received a confirmation email with our pick-up time/location within 24 hours.

On the day of the tour, our driver/guide Dennis picked us & 2 other couples up before heading to our first stop, Estate Argyros. Prior to taking us to the “processing” area where the grapes are taken after harvest, he took us out to see some of the vines up close, explaining some of the history of grape-growing on the island, why the vines are grown in basket-shaped bushes, etc. We definitely received the most information here (although I’m guessing that was strategically planned, since everyone was still sober at this point, LOL) before diving into our 5 samples. Once finished, we made our way to Hatzidakis Winery (my favorite stop of the day) for 6 samples, & then continued on to Venetsanos Winery, where we finished our day with 5 more tasty samples. We thoroughly enjoyed all of the stops as each winery had its own vibe & offered something different than the last.

We were a bit worried going into the tour since neither of us love white wines, but we had an absolute blast. Dennis was extremely knowledgeable & it was clear that he is very passionate about wine & the industry in general. The only thing that was odd was that before getting dropped off, we realized 1 of the other couples was staying at the same hotel as us, yet we were given completely different pick-up locations – No big deal though as it was probably just an oversight by the scheduler. We loved our experience with Santorini Wine Adventures & would highly recommend them to anyone that likes wine & a good time!",April 2019,Santorini Wine Adventure,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482942-d2666881-Reviews-Santorini_Wine_Adventure-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Highly Recommend!,"My husband & I came across Santorini Exclusive Sailing while browsing TripAdvisor & decided to book a sunset sailing tour based off their rave reviews. Vaios was quick to reply to all of my emails, making the reservation process super easy & stress free. We received a reminder email the day prior to our scheduled tour date & on the afternoon of the tour, we were promptly picked up from our hotel as promised. After picking up a family of 4 & another couple, we were dropped off right on the dock (we literally couldn't have been dropped off any closer!), where Vaios was already waiting for us. Once we departed, he gave us some information on himself & the boat, then wasted no time getting the drinks flowing. After making our way to the hot springs (which were freezing, but worth it!), we sailed a bit more until we came upon a calm & quiet cove, perfect for dinner. This was actually our first dinner since arriving in Santorini & it was nothing short of amazing! (It was among our top/favorite meals during our entire 2-week trip through Greece.) As our tour started coming to an end, we made our way back towards the dock to watch the sunset. As expected, there were TONS of other boats out at this time & most (if not all) were jam packed with 20+ people. Yes, those tours are cheaper, but our afternoon spent with Vaios was worth every penny (& more).

Quick Round of Drinks,"We decided to drop by Dionysos just for a quick round of drinks one afternoon. It was rather empty when we arrived & we were asked to help ourselves to any table we wanted. The service was a bit slow (we waited approximately 7-10 minutes for someone to take our order), but I’m guessing because it was an “off” time between lunch & dinner. Either way, we didn’t mind the relaxed atmosphere. I was slightly disappointed the beer I ordered wasn’t available on tap, but no biggie!

Friendly Service,"As a restaurant recommended by Rick Steves, we decided to dine at Argo on our last night in Fira. We didn’t make a reservation in advance, however they were still able to seat us immediately. (It was pretty “early” for dinner by Greek standards.) There were approximately 5 other tables available for “walk ups” without a reservation, but they were quickly filled within 20 minutes or so. After starting with some local wine, we ordered an appetizer to share & two entrees. While everything tasted good, nothing really stood out as memorable to us. The service was friendly & fairly prompt, & the restaurant had a nice atmosphere with partial views of the sunset, depending on your table.

Soak in the Views!,"After walking by Volkan on the Rocks multiple times a day (it was just steps away from our hotel), we decided to stop in for drinks one evening. It was rather quiet & since they had an unobstructed view of the Caldera, we figured we might as well order a bite to eat & stay for the sunset. While the food didn’t “wow” us, we did enjoy our local bottle of wine. The service was a bit slow but we really weren't in a rush, so it didn't bother us.

Spectacular Views,"Venetsanos Winery was the final stop on our wine tasting tour (via Santorini Wine Adventures) & was the perfect place to end a day filled with wine & new friends. There was a lovely, small museum upon entering, filled with old equipment & information related to the history of the estate. After a quick walk through, we made our way down the stairs & out to the patio where we were treated to the most spectacular views ..& some wine, of course. We were given 5 samples (all whites + 1 Vinsanto) along with a generous platter of food pairings. Our guide moved through the samples with us, but I don’t quite remember what he said about them. (At this point, I think everyone was over learning about wines, haha.)

Our Favorite Stop,"Hatzidakis Winery was the second stop on our wine tasting tour (via Santorini Wine Adventures) as well as our favorite stop! As far as the grounds, there isn’t much to see, although a small section of vines is visible from the parking lot. The tasting room is built into the side of a mountain, giving it a cool, cave-like vibe. Upon arrival, we were the only group of visitors, but the tables quickly filled up as we worked our way through 6 wine samples. As red wine drinkers, we were bummed to learn that Santorini produces mainly white grapes, however we thoroughly enjoyed the “Mavrotragano” (a dry red) & decided to purchase a bottle to take home.

Pleasant Experience,"We visited Estate Argyros while on a wine tasting tour (via Santorini Wine Adventures) & had a very pleasant experience. We arrived around 11AM & found ourselves to be the only group on the premises at the time, which was great! (Although it didn't take long before other guests started to arrive.) Both the grounds & the tasting room were beautiful & well-kept. We did not interact with the staff much as we had our tour guide pouring our samples, etc., however everyone was friendly & willing to answer any questions from the group.

(During our first visit, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night, sparking absolute chaos. There was no actual fire, so while it was inconveniencing & the staff handled the situation rather poorly, we decided to give them another shot.) The hotel is directly connected to Terminal 4 & was easily accessible via the Heathrow Express. (We seem to always arrive in Terminal 5.) Our room was located on the 5th floor (both times) & was surprisingly larger than expected; it was also spotless. The bathroom was a good size & although it had minimal counter space, it was sufficient for our needs. The breakfast spread was decent with a variety of fruits, breads, & cereals, as well as a made-to-order egg station – In our opinion, it was definitely worth the small increase in room rate.

Everything Tasted Great,"As a restaurant recommended by Rick Steves, we wanted to give Auberge de la Reine Blanche a try before leaving Paris. We made a reservation in advance as it was a Saturday night, however I’m not sure if one was required. To our surprise, it was quite empty when we arrived. After a few moments of waiting, we were greeted by our waitress, who appeared to be the only one working at the time. We started with a bottle of wine & the onion soup (we had read positive reviews about it), followed by the beef bourguignon – Everything tasted great.

(& When I say last minute, I mean the morning of!) Our friendly & timely guide met us across the street from the museum & gave us a quick history lesson before taking us in – The skip-the-line access was well worth the money. We were a bit overwhelmed upon entering, but having someone to show us the way was extremely helpful. Our guide was very knowledgeable & provided insight on a variety of topics we would’ve otherwise missed out on had we toured the museum alone. We never felt rushed at any of the exhibits & although it was impossible to see everything, we opted to stay a bit longer after the tour concluded.

Enjoyed Our Day,"We came across Fat Tire Tours while searching for tour companies in Paris & ultimately chose them based on their positive reviews & large variety of tours. We originally booked two separate tours & while we unfortunately had to cancel one of them, we found the cancellation process to be painless. On the morning of our tour (Notre Dame Towers & Sainte-Chapelle), we had some trouble finding our guide at the meeting point as she had the company logo on her shirt covered up, but no biggie! We walked over to Sainte-Chapelle first, where she gave us some background information on the buildings’ history before giving us free time to explore inside & admire the stained glass. Afterwards, we headed over to Notre Dame, where there was already a large line waiting to enter. It moved quicker than expected, however our guide utilized this time to explain the history of the Cathedral, which was much appreciated. Once done inside, we made our way to the Bell Tower entrance line. We heard it was slow-moving, so we were thankful to have skip-the-line access! The climb to the top was not too difficult as there were multiple areas to stop & rest if needed. The views were amazing & well worth it – It was truly the highlight of the tour.

We had a few questions on the menu, however our waitress was less than enthused to answer them. Three of the four of us ordered the same dish, which also seemed to annoy her. Our food arrived quickly, but was really nothing special – Average at best. While eating, a few other customers popped in, with a party of two being seated directly beside us.

Mountain Tubing Adventure,"We’ve done KBA’s Mountain Tubing Adventure twice now, with the most recent experience being this past April. Booking our tour online was so simple, & their building was super easy to locate off the highway. Check-in was also a breeze as they have the entire process (signing of the waiver, distribution of equipment, etc.) organized in the most efficient way possible. The ride out to the plantation could be considered an adventure in itself – Be prepared for rough terrain, but jaw-dropping scenery! Once we arrived at the starting point, we were briefed on safety before heading down to the water. It was chilly, but you get used to it pretty quickly! There are a total of 5 tunnels, with the last one being completely dark as you go through. Afterwards, we made the short journey to a picnic area where we could change into dry clothes & enjoy a quick build-your-own sandwich lunch before packing up & heading back. Even though it was our second time, we had just as much fun as our first. All of the guides were so great (both times!) – They really make it a memorable experience.

No Churros!?,"We took the RER to/from Disneyland Paris as it seemed to be the most efficient mode of transportation. As a huge Disneyland California fan, I was pretty excited to spend the day here, but sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. Very few rides offered the Fast Pass option & most (if not all) had distributed its entire days’ worth of passes by noon – We arrived at the park as it was opening & were only able to snag 2 or 3. Another huge disappointment was the fact that there were no churros. (I thought $6 churros were a Disneyland staple?!) We couldn’t even find any fancy candied apples or pastries as a substitute. Aside from a majority of the employees being noticeably unfriendly/unhappy, the restrooms & overall cleanliness of the park were not up to standard. I did however enjoy seeing the similarities & differences between the Paris-versions of Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. compared to the California-versions. Towards the end of the night, we ventured over to Walt Disney Studios, but were only able to ride a few attractions as the lines were still pretty long.

We spent about 20 minutes downstairs admiring the stained glass, but you could easily spend longer!",October 2017,Sainte-Chapelle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d190202-Reviews-Sainte_Chapelle-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Quite the Site!,"We heard tickets often sell out, especially those around sunset, so we booked ours months in advance via the official Eiffel Tower website. When we arrived, only 2 lifts between the ground & level 2 were operating, so the lines were pretty long – We waited approximately 30-40 minutes. When it was finally our turn, they packed an uncomfortable number of people inside the lift. To be honest, it was awful, but the ride was pretty quick. Once we exited, we headed straight to the line for the summit lifts. These too were packed full & the ride up felt like forever (especially for those afraid of heights), but it was worth it. I would recommend staying on the Tower until the twinkling lights come on as it’s quite the site to see!",October 2017,Eiffel Tower,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188151-Reviews-Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
Reims Champagne Tour,"We first came across the Reims Champagne tour via Fat Tire Tours, however we ultimately booked directly through Paris City Vision as it was substantially cheaper. Our hotel was on Ile Saint-Louis, but we were able to easily navigate to the meeting point (their main office) via the Metro.

Once we were on our way to Reims, our guide (who sounded rather unenthused) announced the schedule for the day as well as provided some background information on the sites & cellars we would be visiting. Our first stop was G.H.Mumm, which we really enjoyed. Our guide (different from our PCV guide) was knowledgeable & engaging, & to top it off, we didn’t see any other tourists the entire time we were there. We then continued on to Reims, where we were given approximately two hours to explore the Cathedral & the surrounding area. Afterwards, we were bused to Mercier, the second cellar & final stop of the day. Mercier was much more crowded than G.H. Mumm, & the cellar tour wasn’t quite as good, but we enjoyed the tasting at the end. The ride back to Paris felt extremely long as we ended up hitting the evening rush hour.

Our PCV guide didn’t offer much “guidance” throughout the day (nor did he serve much of a purpose), but it didn’t really bother us. Overall, we enjoyed the tour, although we would have liked more free time in Reims – Two hours didn’t seem to be enough.",October 2017,Paris City Vision,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d667302-Reviews-Paris_City_Vision-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",attractions,4.0,4.0
Enjoyed Our Stay,"We recently stayed at the Conrad London St. James for 4 nights & were very pleased with our stay. Prior to our arrival, we arranged a transfer via the Concierge, which was extremely easy. We would definitely recommend this, especially if you have a late flight into LHR.

We stayed in a King Grand Deluxe room, which we found to be sufficient for our needs. The room was very clean & was a comfortable size, as was the bathroom. The only issue we noticed was that water would occasionally seep out from underneath the shower door – Not a big deal though. Housekeeping did an excellent job & per our request, restocked all of our daily waters with still instead of sparkling, which was much appreciated.

The location of the hotel was great, with the St. James tube station directly across the street. Westminster Abbey was less than a 10-minute walk, with Big Ben just beyond. Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, & Piccadilly Circus were all within walking distance as well. The London Tower, Tower Bridge, St. Paul’s Cathedral, & Harrod’s were all easily accessible via the tube.

We dined at the on-site restaurant Blue Boar (out of convenience) after returning to the hotel late one evening. Although the service was a bit slow, we enjoyed the food & the atmosphere. On a separate occasion, we stopped by the lobby bar for drinks after dinner & were surprised to see the bartender approaching other tables to take orders, but not ours. We actually had to go up to the counter to place our order. We found it rather strange, but perhaps he thought we were just waiting for someone. All of the other staff members we encountered during our stay were very kind & helpful.

From the clean rooms to the central location, we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Despite our odd experience at the bar, we would return if we found ourselves visiting the area again.",October 2017,Conrad London St. James,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d2309633-Reviews-Conrad_London_St_James-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
A Must-See!,"We stopped by the Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Reims while on a day trip from Paris (via Paris City Vision tours) & were blown away by its beauty. There was no fee to enter & it was nearly empty. (Something we weren’t used to, coming from Paris!) The construction on the entrance that other reviewers have mentioned must be fairly recent as we saw no evidence of work being done during our visit. Under construction or not, the architecture is simply amazing – This cathedral is a must-see!",October 2017,Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Reims,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187137-d230790-Reviews-Cathedrale_Notre_Dame_de_Reims-Reims_Marne_Grand_Est.html,"Reims, France",attractions,5.0,4.5
We Loved It,"La Maison Mumm was the first cellar we visited on our “Reims Champagne” day tour (via Paris City Vision tours) & we loved it. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by our guide, who explained the champagne-making process before taking us down to the cellar. Seeing all of the racks, the different stages the bottles were in, & the miles of (what looked like) endless tunnels was really fascinating. We also walked through a small “museum,” which explained some of the Mumm history before heading back up to the tasting room. We ended up buying two bottles as gifts, although I wish we would’ve bought more!",October 2017,La Maison Mumm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187137-d234202-Reviews-La_Maison_Mumm-Reims_Marne_Grand_Est.html,"Reims, France",attractions,5.0,4.0
Decent Tour,"We visited Mercier on our “Reims Champagne” day tour (via Paris City Vision tours) & needless to say, it was not our favorite cellar. After a short wait upon arrival, we were shuffled into a small room to view a video on the history of Mercier. Afterwards, we were (uncomfortably) squeezed into an elevator down to the cellar, where the tour continued via train. We would’ve preferred to walk the cellar while listening along to the guide, but I don’t think that was even an option. Overall, it seemed like a majority of the information from the previously viewed video was just repeated on the train tour. After doing the tasting, we stepped outside to walk through the small on-site vineyard – This was honestly my favorite part!",October 2017,Mercier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187136-d230772-Reviews-Mercier-Epernay_Marne_Grand_Est.html,"Epernay, France",attractions,3.0,4.0
Beautiful Colors Everywhere!,"We walked through St. James’s Park as a short cut on our way to Buckingham Palace. We visited during what we’d consider “the changing of the leaves,” & there were beautiful colors everywhere! The park was a good size & very well maintained – Great for people watching or a picnic!",October 2017,St. James's Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d188126-Reviews-St_James_s_Park-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Extremely Crowded,"Being within walking distance from our hotel, we made a quick stop to see the iconic Buckingham Palace. It was extremely crowded (as expected), but beautiful nonetheless! We went in the early afternoon & found it difficult to get good photographs as there were people and selfie sticks everywhere! It probably would've been better to visit in the early morning.",October 2017,Buckingham Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187549-Reviews-Buckingham_Palace-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
A Bit Underwhelming,"While we didn’t have time to visit the National Gallery, we still made a quick stop at the famous Trafalgar Square. It was a bit underwhelming, but the fountains & lion statues were nice to see. The weather wasn’t in our favor that day so unfortunately, we didn’t stay long. Otherwise, it seemed like it would've been a nice place to hang out as there were multiple restaurants in the surrounding area.",October 2017,Trafalgar Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d188964-Reviews-Trafalgar_Square-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,3.0,4.5
