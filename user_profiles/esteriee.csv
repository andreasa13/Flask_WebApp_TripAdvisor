Amazing Museum!,"One of the best museums weâ€™re been to: a lot of natural sunlight, interesting exhibits, and clear detailed information on these.

The museum is built over a live archaeological dig of a village, with the structures / pipes are still evident. Impressive!

The higher levels of the museum have transparent floors so that you will be able to look straight down into the dig.

Our favourite was the top floor of the museum - which has exhibits on the Pantheon, with clear windows looking right out at the Pantheon so you can use your imagination on how that would look.

Also houses a cafe with a good view of the Acropolis.

Highly recommended to visit the Acropolis earlier in the morning (out of the heat of the day) and the Acropolis Museum thereafter.",October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
2 hour visit!,"One of the must sees in Athens, but we felt that this was a little bit over-rated. Although it was end October, it was rather sunny and could be slightly warm (even in shorts!)

There is much to see but if you lack a very keen interest in Greek history (or do not have much background of such), it may be a bit boring after some time.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Sunset Hike - Mt Batur,"We made arrangements with the company conveniently via WhatsApp and were promptly picked up at our hotel in Canggu at the stipulated time.

Our tour guide Gede / Legawa was wonderful! He came fully equipped for our hike, helpfully carried our very heavy shoebag while guiding us along the more unstable parts of the hike. He also told more about Mt Batur and how sacred it is to the Balinese people.

Upon reaching the summit, Gede prepared some banana sandwiches and hot drinks. He (and another tour guide) also led us into the crater to watch the volcanic steam cook eggs.

We unfortunately did not manage to see too much of a sunset due to a cloudy day but had an enjoyable time hiking down under the stars with our torches.

Thank you for being such a wonderful guide Gede / Legawa!",November 2018,Mount Batur Sunset Trekking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303952-d12902303-Reviews-Mount_Batur_Sunset_Trekking-Kintamani_Bangli_Bali.html,"Kintamani, Indonesia",attractions,5.0,5.0
Fun Way to See the City!,"Two of us girls booked a tuk-tuk tour to see the sights around Colombo and eat our way round the city. This took a good part of the late afternoon till evening.

We were taken around by D, who was very patient with our numerous requests (for food, for gem seller recommendations, for restroom breaks, to help us take 1000 photos at the same spot, etc.).

We felt that the route was very well-planned, we were very well-taken care of and it was one of our highlights in Colombo!",March 2018,Colombo Bay Tuk Tuk City Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g293962-d14141064-Colombo_Bay_Tuk_Tuk_City_Tour-Colombo_Western_Province.html,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",activities,4.0,5.0
Good but not Wow,"The crabs were fresh, the service was splendid but the food was pretty good.

Eating in this historical building is a wonderful experience but we did feel that the meal unfortunately did not justify the high price point.",August 2017,Ministry of Crab,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293962-d2477739-Reviews-Ministry_of_Crab-Colombo_Western_Province.html,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Fresh Healthy Food,"Lovely chill place - it felt like we were spending time enjoying the afternoon in a friend's backyard. The food is cooked upon order - the chicken, soup, fruits we had were extremely fresh, we felt that they were worth the wait!

Food is also very affordable!",February 2018,Meewitha Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g612380-d7814156-Reviews-Meewitha_Restaurant-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html,"Weligama, Sri Lanka",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Bad food,"Restaurant was fairly empty when I arrived for a late lunch. I ordered a sabich and some falafels and they took about 30 minutes to get these ready. When ready, the sabich bread had a terrible odour (akin to the smell one has of bread that has been kept in the fridge for too many weeks) and the food was not too tasty.

Convenient location, over-priced, bad food but I count myself very fortunate that there was no stomach upset (considering the other reviews).",February 2018,Breakpoint,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g612380-d9563431-Reviews-Breakpoint-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html,"Weligama, Sri Lanka",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Fantastic!,"Three of us had a feast of very fresh seafood, vegetables and crab with rice over dinner! The seafood was very fresh, with the ambience on the beach. The plates, cups were not hygienically clean and there were some flies around, but it was a fantastic dinner nevertheless!

Service was very prompt and courteous,",February 2018,Fish Point Weligama,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g612380-d7894994-Reviews-Fish_Point_Weligama-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html,"Weligama, Sri Lanka",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Affordable Fresh Tasty Seafood,"The fish is as fresh as it gets and cooked to perfection with rice, fries, salad or others, accompanied by an amazing sauce! Our party of 4 had a very delicious meal!",January 2018,Fisherman Father Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g612380-d13329924-Reviews-Fisherman_Father_Restaurant-Weligama_Matara_Southern_Province.html,"Weligama, Sri Lanka",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Dragon Back Trek!,"The other Tripadvisor reviewers were right: this is a must-do for those looking for an active city-break from KL's concrete jungle!

The trek/climb to the first peak of the trek was slightly challenging due to the steep terrain, dense vegetation but is certainly not insurmountable. The panoramic views at the peaks of the city skyline and the water catchment area at the three peaks are certainly more than worth the workout!

Amos is truly passionate about sharing his love for trekking and guiding everyone through the trek safely and enjoyably! He took very good care of us - taking care of transport arrangements, sharing his knowledge on KL & the tropical rainforest ecosystem, guiding us on how to trek up steep cliffs, ensuring everyone had the essentials, suggesting where to stand for photos, and sending us the photos he took of us.

We urge anyone who's interested in a short quick trek outside KL's concrete jungle to go for the DBT with these guys! This was easily the highlight of our short KL trip and we are looking forward to going on another of their treks!",October 2017,Open Sky Unlimited,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298570-d2074038-Reviews-Open_Sky_Unlimited-Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",attractions,5.0,5.0
