Great place and atmosphere,"It was a wonderful atmosphere here with everyone happy and all the workers smiling. They easily helped my mother with her coeliac disease. There could be a bit more room though, no there fault.",October 2019,Peas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14101757-Reviews-Peas-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good,"It was nice to see,but you couldn’t get too close. There was a gate around it, that you could get through, but even then there quite a big area between you and the monument.",October 2019,Temple of Olympian Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242844-Reviews-Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0
Interesting but out-dated,"It was quite interesting and there was a lot of things like swords and photos, it was also at some points quite sad. However, it was quite out-dated as ,unlike a lot of other museums, there barely anything interactive, if not anything. Also, you need to know Greek as there is barely anything written in English. The shop has a lot of good things to buy, but it is under-staffed, especially on holidays.",October 2019,War Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d498309-Reviews-War_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Good but hard to get to,"It’s a great place and definitely worth the walk. You should avoid main holidays as it’ll be packed and you should bring water as there is a sparse amount of water taps. If you are/ have any elderly people than you should make sure someone is there to help them as it is quite steep. Also, the stone you walk on is quite slippery even when dry.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great,"It was a great place. You’re not just paying for the food, but for the whole experience as you can watch them make it then and there.",October 2019,IceRoll Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d15030657-Reviews-IceRoll_Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Great shop and you should visit,I bought 2 sets of 100 stamps on sale for £7 here and I got some for free just as a gift. The shop-owner was very helpful and we had a very nice conversation. I would highly recommend it.,August 2019,Gustamps,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186273-d8870500-Reviews-Gustamps-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html,"Brighton, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,5.0
