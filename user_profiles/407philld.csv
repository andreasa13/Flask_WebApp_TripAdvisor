Surprise! Surprise!,"We attended the restaurant last Wednesday.
Lucky for us it was a cheap eats day.
We enjoyed beautifully cooked pasta and roast of the day. Both meals were quite big and flavor-some. We did not wait too long for the meals to come to the table. Some staff were quite friendly.
Will come back again.",January 2019,Frankston RSL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g552173-d2270535-Reviews-Frankston_RSL-Frankston_Mornington_Peninsula_Victoria.html,"Frankston, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
