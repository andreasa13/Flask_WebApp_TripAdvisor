a must see on a Delhi itinery,"having visited Delhi previously and had an argument with the tour guide as to whether you could access the building i was determined to return and bought him a ticket just to prove the point!. it rather says much about how the building is marketed that even some of the tour guides don't know how to access it. The building is stunning and well worth visiting even to see the small number of rooms on the guided tour. I won't give a history lesson you can read all about it in more eloquent terms than mine, what I will say is that the booking system is a nightmare hence the deduction of a star. the tickets are not released that early so don't dispair if you are told there is no availability, just keep trying. I ended up buying the tickets twice as the system told me it had failed the first time but at approx 50p a ticket it wasn't relevant. The mughal gardens are also worth the visit - even if you are guided via the boring herb garden! This really should be on a tour itinery as an absolute must in Delhi - be prepared for a little over enthusiastic security - I had my passort checked five times but that said there was no aggression or hostility and the setting and design are a must see",February 2020,Rashtrapati Bhavan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304551-d321495-Reviews-Rashtrapati_Bhavan-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,"New Delhi, India",attractions,4.0,4.5
tired hotel but with great service,"i arrived at the Plaza at about 1.30pm, the building is covered in scaffolding and not particularly attractive, the reception from the porters was excellent and i was escorted through the shabby entrance to reception. check in was quick but was told the room was not ready but that I was top of the list and they would call me as soon as the room was available even checking my mobile phone number (usual check in 3.00pm but often earlier) I wandered down to the food hall in the basement which was the first sign of the underlying problems of this hotel - far too many outlets with way too few places to seat - you can't have an Italian restaurant with 8 seats, it's nonsensical, the whole space felt like everything had been shoehorned in with the result of a confused mess, this whole space needs a serious re-think.
I then went upstairs to the rose club to sit while waiting for the room, dreadful worn out threadbare furniture, damaged tables and electrical wires sellotaped to the wall a thoroughly dismal space (to be fair from the new video on the website it appears that this has now been refurbished but I think it needs more than has been done), when it got to 3.30pm (way past usual check in) and not having received a call I went back to reception, suddenly the room was ready (no apology proffered for the fact that I hadn’t been called), an unfortunate welcome experience but now standard in my experience for Fairmont. I used to use Fairmont exclusively until they were taken over by Accord when standards fell significantly.
The room was adequate but again in need of attention, the faux Empire furniture with the hint of 1982 is dated as is the bathroom – the boast as to the mosaic walls slightly reminiscent of public conveniences is something that they should not be proud of, and the carpets are well past their best. On the plus side, the room was clean and the sheets good quality. Having gone out and done some touristy things, I returned to the hotel and decided to go for a drink in the rose club. Service was adequate but the atmosphere quite flat, I was however quite shocked to be blatantly approached and propositioned by a prostitute. Accepted this happens in hotels across the world but good hotels ensure it is discrete, I have never encountered low grade hookers clearly known to the staff propositioning clientele in front of families. I left (without the hooker) and had a decent night’s sleep. I had breakfast on two occasions in the Palm Court. Very attentive service, quite nice setting if a little tired, food was good but not mind blowing and $60 for an al a carte breakfast (consisting of Eggs Benedict and two slices of toast and a glass of orange juice) is overly pricey for the standard – the eggs were barely warm by the time they reached the table.
The hotel advertises a free hotel car and to enquire at concierge as to its availability, the concierge was rude in his response stating he wouldn’t know anything about it and to speak to the doormen. Of course, the car is always “out” and may be back in 20-30 minutes. I can’t really see the point in offering it as a service when maybe 1% of lucky guests get to ride in it - it is easier to take the subway.
I also visited the Palm Court for afternoon tea, again the staff were wonderful ensuring that even on a packed Saturday afternoon with no reservation they found me a table. The food was extremely average, probably one of the worst afternoon teas I have had, I have had better offering for free in club lounges. Five average small savouries, two poor scones (and the jam and cream are left open on the table) and five miniature patisserie items, a pot of tea and two glasses of champagne (the glasses are so small you need to take a second) $180! Before the tip, Total rip off. The equivalent in Harrods in London where plates are replenished as often as you wish and far better-quality food is less than half the price. It’s not that I have an issue paying the price if you get value for money, but there was little value here and the entire hotel trades on a past glory and in somewhat ignorance of the rest of the world.
Obviously location of the hotel is fantastic with a subway entrance on the same block, the service at the hotel was 95% excellent and the room was spacious and clean, but this hotel needs (a) a major make over including the peculiar Champagne bar area which is an illogicality in its design and was always crowded to the point I could never find a seat (b) the lifts are exceedingly slow (c) the hotel caters to too many non-residents – finding a table anywhere is a challenge (d) the “shopping mall” is dreadful – a range of awful rather pointless shops (e) the food hall is a poor concept and does not convey any hint of luxury – well not till you get the bill (f) the whole hotel is past its sell by date
I would see no reason to stay here again even with the proposed refurbishment, there are better offerings in NYC more attuned to the 21st century and to the true needs of a world traveller I doubt whether the Plaza will ever be anything more than a part of history and a spot on the tourist map.",November 2019,The Plaza New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d675616-Reviews-The_Plaza_New_York-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",hotels,3.0,4.5
no that amazing,"booked the trip to the 102nd floor to see the amazing skyline, not really sure what people get excited about, i've been up taller buildings with better facilities and views so yes i ticked it off the list, no it didn't amaze me and no i have no need to go again",November 2019,Empire State Building,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d104365-Reviews-Empire_State_Building-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,3.0,4.5
solace from the darkness,"i was undecided whether this was worth the visit or not but was blown away by the incredible respect that was given in creating this memorial. the waterfall is an incredible understated statement and and extremely powerful message when you stand in its atmosphere - the museum is much larger than i expected, i took a guided audio tour for an hour - the tour leader was Will who provided lightness at the right times and extreme solemnity at others - impossible not to be emotionally moved by this humbling experience",November 2019,The National 9/11 Memorial & Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d1687489-Reviews-The_National_9_11_Memorial_Museum-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.5
excellent introduction to the treasures of the Met,"i prefer to take a private tour or a major attraction to get a good overview and then go back in my own time and study carefully the pieces that are to my particular interest, i met with the guide Katherine at the appointed time, she was engaging througout and made sure that we covered areas that were of my interest rather than just concentrating on her favourite pieces, we were so engaged in discussing various artists from our respective prospectives that we lost track of time and the tour went well beyond the alloted time - it was a very enjoyable tour and Katherine tailored it very well to my requirements",November 2019,Metropolitan Museum of Art Private Guided Tour with Skip-the-Line Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g60763-d12471904-Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Private_Guided_Tour_with_Skip_the_Line_Ticket-New_York_C.html,"New York City, New York",activities,5.0,5.0
fair offering for a one night stay,"this was booked by the tour company as part of a luxury private golden triangle tour, i wouldn't book Hilton as a luxury hotel as they are usually adequate but corporate and lack the finesse of a true luxury hotel. Check in was swift and the room as adequate generally clean although not pristine - i didn't notice till i opened the curtains the next day that there was a thick layer of dust on the desk area.
the tour company had arranged a complimentary dinner in the restaurant, i went to the restaurant but it was heaving with noisy tour groups of Russians, Chinese and Americans all shouting over each other and very loud music being played over the top of it - i decided to forego the dinner, i popped my head into the bar which was also heaving and not a seat to be had. this was a Thursday night and i don't know whether it was a specific of that night or is the usual status, the hotel would be standard choice for tour groups so i wouldn't want to stay here longer than the one night. The bed was comfortable and i slept well. Breakfast was adequate with a fair choice but slightly marred by the tour groups descending on the buffet like locusts and with the need to shout at each other. Check out was again very swift. the staff i encountered were all friendly and professional. so if i found myself in Jaipur again I would consider the Hilton but probably book the executive level to avoid the large tour groups",October 2019,Hilton Jaipur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304555-d6540893-Reviews-Hilton_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html,"Jaipur, India",hotels,4.0,4.5
definately a place to visit when in Agra,"beautiful buildings with an interesting history, always best to go with a guide to explain more about what you are looking at
only downside is that the guy in the ticket booth short changed me by 1000 rupees - I wanted to pay by card but ""the machine is not working"" so I had to pay in cash, I gave him 2000 he gave me change for 1000. I wouldn't normally think about checking someone on the official desk and therefore only noticed when i went to tip the guide so the lesson is always check your change",October 2019,Agra Fort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297683-d319695-Reviews-Agra_Fort-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,"Agra, India",attractions,4.0,4.5
stunning although you don't need to go at sunrise,"picked up from the hotel at 5.30am to visit the Taj at sunrise, there isn't much I can say that has not already been said many times, it is a stunning building and beautifully kept
I will however comment on the early start. we arrived at the entrance at about 5.45am to purchase the ticket, it was very dark and almost impossible to see. you then stand in a queue as it opens at 6. there were quite a lot of people all subjected to the early morning visit. the guide said it would be even worse by 10am. I waited for the sunrise, when it happened it was not that breath-taking - ok I visited on a hazy morning so perhaps it may be more impressive on a clear day. the guide then informed me it looks best in moonlight and that access is then limited to 50 people. if I am in Agra again I would certainly do the moonlight visit - but wild horses won't drag me out of bed before crack of dawn again",October 2019,Taj Mahal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297683-d317329-Reviews-Taj_Mahal-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,"Agra, India",attractions,5.0,5.0
dirty sheets and dreadful breakfast,"i avoid Marriott hotels wherever possible and this reminded me how basic they are particularly at the Courtyard level - this hotel was booked by the tour company as part of a luxury golden triangel tour, if I'd known it would be the Courtyard in advance I would have ensured it was changed - i arrived at the hotel and my suitcase was immediatrely taken by the porter, check in was smooth and the reception area was decent. i went to the room, the first thing i do is to pull off the duvet and check the sheets, these did not look fresh, i turned over the pillows and they were dirty on the reverse, i waited 30 minutes and my case had still not arrived. I went to reception and reported the missing case and the dirty sheets. i was immediadly offered another room and asked if i could identify my case - it was sitting at the porters stand clearly they had no idea who it belonged to, i returned to the room and the porter arrived shortly after with the case and the new room key. new room same dirty sheets. managers appeared and suggested it was an ironing issue - i pointed out dirt was not an issue with ironing. the sheets were then changed in front of me - big shame they didn't notice the rather long black hair stuck to the matress protector. the only positive thing was that the managers and room staff were responsive and polite and did make efforts to resolve the issue I had with their wifi
breakfast the following morning was a miserable offering. probably the worst breakfast in any hotel i have ever experienced - having gone round the ""buffet"" several times i returned with a tomato, a piece of cheddar and a jacobs cracker. i asked for a black coffee, it was like dishwater. still hungry i returned to the buffet in search of a pastry and found a donut - well at least something masquerading as a donut - one bite, i had to spit it out. the staff in the breakfast room were average rather than excelling at anything, they had a general bored look on their faces.

if you are looking for a 5* luxury offering you won't find it here, it has a certain travellodge feel and the low cost ""eat all you can"" buffet round the pool in the dark is definitely one i would avoid at all costs",October 2019,Courtyard Agra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297683-d7384717-Reviews-Courtyard_Agra-Agra_Agra_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,"Agra, India",hotels,1.0,4.5
beautiful and touching site,"there is so much to take in with the history of India it is not always easy to follow - good to have a guide who knows what to detail and what to leave out but always also good to try and understand a little before you go so you have an idea what you are looking at - this is an important historical site and an essential on any Delhi tour - stunning buildings and beautiful gardens - i was at first apprehensive that we went on a day that appeared to be school outing day but unlike many other ""civilisations"" all of the children were exceptionally well behaved and courteous",October 2019,Qutub Minar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304551-d311626-Reviews-Qutub_Minar-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,"New Delhi, India",attractions,5.0,4.5
wonderful calming experience,"a friend in Delhi arranged for us to go together to the temple, as others have said this is a religious site and you should show respect and wear appropriate clothing, no mobiles and no photos so either leave them in the lockers or in your car with the driver - they will be perfectly safe
the temple itself if relatively recent constructed early 2000s the architecture is impressive as is the solid gold statue inside (i'm never sure within the principles of religion whether spending such vast sums on decorative objects is justified when the funds could be used to feed the starving but that is a different discussion) the temple is stunning and well worth the visit
after the temple you can visit the show with tells the history by way of animated exhibits, you have to constantly move from room to room to listen to each part of the story and then see it all again in a short film - after that sit with hundreds of others on the steps of the temple and take in an impressive light and fountain show - it is lovely to see so many families and couples peacefully enjoying the scene - no pushing or shoving no shouting and children behaving very well, then take a journey in a boat on an underground canal which highlights the history of India and its discoveries - no matter your opinion on the claims the experience is beautiful - it will be a long lasting memory and one i was grateful and honoured to have shared with a dear Indian friend",October 2019,Swaminarayan Akshardham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304551-d626913-Reviews-Swaminarayan_Akshardham-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,"New Delhi, India",attractions,5.0,4.5
Sahngri-la's service is always exceptional,"i have stayed at several Shangri-la hotels and have never experienced one element of bad service which i think is far more difficult to deliver than good service. as expected the service was excellent from the second i entered to the second i left, the room was clean and comfortable and the staff were constantly checking that everything was ok, when i asked for an extra miniture of shower gel six appeared.
i booked a club room which are located on the upper floors so there is a good view from the room and from the club room, the food in the club room was well laid out and tasty. the spa on the lower ground is very tastefully decorated and the walk to the pool area very nice, service at the pool was again top level. a very good choice for a luxury offering in the centre of Delhi for either buisness or leisure",October 2019,"Shangri-La's - Eros Hotel, New Delhi",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304551-d578527-Reviews-Shangri_La_s_Eros_Hotel_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,"New Delhi, India",hotels,5.0,4.5
the must see,"I last visited Athens 40 years ago and much has changed - in particular the attitude of the Greeks to service, it was one of the more eye opening elements of an entire trip - vast improvement. the must see of Athens the Acropolis never fails to impress although in today's world the crowds are immense, but part of the improvement in service is that they were being moved along very efficiently. i didn't have a pre purchased ticket and there was no queue at the booth, there was also only a small queue at the entrance - i already knew much about the Acropolis and Parthenon so i didn't take a guide but if you are new to the history then a guide would be indepensible",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
beautiful building with thoughtful exhibition,i visited the museum wihtout a skip the line ticket and waited only about five minutes the queue was not long and i did not go particularily early - it is useful to take the paper guide as there is no audio guide available which is a shame. the building is impressive and the exhibits very well presented - service was excellent as was service at the terrace restaurant within the building - food was also very good. well worth a visit,October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
hidden gem,outstanding boutique hotel right in the centre of Athens 5 mins walk to Kolonaki square and accessible on foot to all the places you would want to visit. service from all the staff was exceptional (with a special mention for Gerry who made the entire stay totally issue free) nicely decorated modern rooms with all the conveniences you need - we took two junior suites and they were spacious and comfortable. the breakfast was excellent with eggs cooked to your choice. a very good choice for travellers who don't want the formality of a large hotel but expect excellence in all areas,October 2019,Oniro City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d17454536-Reviews-Oniro_City-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
excellent service although starting to show its age,"the service at the hotel was excellent in all areas, the staff at the club room were all very helpful and attentive. reception, bar and pool staff also high standard
the room was nice although starting to show its age a little, a few too many chips on the furniture, the bathroom grounting looking a little tired although i should state that the room was spotless and housekeeing were continually in the corridor.
the sun loungers around the pool and the beach club are also looking tired and would benefit from updating which is the sole reason for 4 rather than 5 stars
afternoon tea and evening canapes in the club lounge were very high standard so i would definately stay here again when next in AD",September 2019,InterContinental Abu Dhabi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294013-d299238-Reviews-InterContinental_Abu_Dhabi-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,4.5
just breathtaking,if you follow the standard route you will come to the lions - its a little difficult to miss them! very impressive and must have been terrifying when created. I would have though it better in fact to remove all the original lions from their position and put them into the museum and replace them in the outside with replicas - it would provide a much better understanding of how imposing they were when erected and would preserve the originals from further deterioration.,May 2019,Avenue of the Lions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g202339-d196075-Reviews-Avenue_of_the_Lions-Delos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Delos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
some amazing pieces,"really worth spending an hour or so looking at these exhibits but get the info guide to understand each piece, particularly nice to see the Lions really close up really stunning - shame about the damage to the walls - needs a redecoration and the Lions aren't shown to their best as they appear just to have been stuck in a room at the back but all the same if you have made it to Delos then you really do need to visit the museum",May 2019,Archaeological Museum of Delos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g202339-d3161867-Reviews-Archaeological_Museum_of_Delos-Delos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Delos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
wonderful experience,"ok I probably should have been an archaeologist as I find such places fascinating and they are still finding new details about the civilizations who lived here, well worth a visit for half of a full day. best to start early around 9.00am although in true Greek style I was told the ferry would depart at 9am then it was leaving at 9.30am then 10.00am and actually left at 9.05am!. ferry will cost you 20 euros return and you can return at any time, you but the ticket from a booth next to the Church in the old harbour, you will pay 12 euros when you arrive in Delos. I avoided booking a guided tour so that I could take it at my own pace, I did download a guide book - delos a complete guide by NA Vrissimtzis and with the site plan you get at the arrival it was probably the best way of doing it . the museum has some exceptional pieces so don't miss it, the current Gormley exhibition all over the island is interesting but a bit too random for me.
climbing to the top is heavy going and there isn't much to get excited about so I would probably stop at the temples half way up unless you are super fit or love a challenge - I will definitely return on my next trip",May 2019,Archaeological Site of Delos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g202339-d4297568-Reviews-Archaeological_Site_of_Delos-Delos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Delos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
an experience at eyewatering prices,"ok so if you want to take coffee in St Marks square you have to visit Florian but on a day when you can sit inside as the interior decoration is what really makes the place, I knew it wouldn't be cheap but even I balk at €16 for a coffee - the service was excellent and definitely an experience so if you don't care about £ or $ then do go visit",April 2019,Cafe Florian,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d945776-Reviews-Cafe_Florian-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,4.0,4.0
good location average food and price,"I wasn't expecting that much from a restaurant on the waterfront with average prices, although to be fair I couldn't complain about the service, we were attended by two waiters and they were both friendly and engaging so based on the reviews of others it is probably hit or miss - the food was ok, nothing outstanding but adequate for the price - only one of us had a glass of wind and the bill was less than £90 for three people so for a waterfront position on a Saturday night with good service it was not expensive.",April 2019,Ristorante Omnibus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187870-d1104086-Reviews-Ristorante_Omnibus-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",restaurants,3.0,3.0

always a must,"visited on Good Friday morning and the crowds were horrific - always get a skip the line access and best with a professional guide who can direct you to the most important aspects, sadly there were too many tourists who have no interest in the building or it's history but merely want to tick it off their list or are on a group visit from a cruise ship, best to visit more out of season to be able to truly appreciate the beauty and sanctity",April 2019,Basilica di San Marco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d191226-Reviews-Basilica_di_San_Marco-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
never fails to impress,"I've visited the Doge's palace many times and am always amazed by the former Venetian power house - you need of course to know the history to truly appreciate it and a professional guide is recommended, you also have to have some imagination as to the prison cells to truly understand how horrific it must have been - well worth a visit",April 2019,Doge's Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d194251-Reviews-Doge_s_Palace-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
you have to understand her to appreciate this,"the Peggy Guggenheim collection is housed in her former home facing the Grand Canal - the collection is presented as she displayed it herself for her own enjoyment and it is an impressive display of modern (or when she was collecting contemporary) art. I am not a great lover of Picasso in general other than early works but to see a piece specially commissioned by her hanging on her wall puts her life into perspective. some have commented that she had more money than sense, the reverse is true, the collections she amassed she acquired at very knock down prices during the 30s and 40s when people had to sell. she stopped buying when she considered they had become too expensive. obviously if you are engaging a friend to do a painting you are not paying market rate!. I wasn't mad on the house itself, it was in fact a little disappointing but certainly the paintings and sculptures are an impressive collection (well they were to me but I don't profess to be any kind of expert), but do read up a little on her history so that you can more appreciate the woman. There is no point going if you are doing it to ""tick off"" your list you need to , and it is not a place that is really child friendly (what 5 year old is going to understand Kandinsky?) so do leave them behind. There is quite a nice café on site that was adequate and a pleasant respite.

great location and staff,"this is a very well located hotel adjacent to the St Angelo Vaporetto stop - although you can walk comfortably from the hotel to all the locations you would want to visit. the room was clear and nicely decorated in neutral tones, was very clean and the bed extremely comfortably - had three very good night's sleep. the staff were all wonderful and really felt like they would attend to your requests without issue. the breakfast was a good balanced offering with plenty of healthy choices and again the serving staff were all very attentive and polite. the only downside is that sometimes I don't want to venture far from the hotel in the evening and there is not an evening restaurant as such, but then again there are many dining options in Venice all within a short stroll which offer excellent choices. if you want a hotel that is an excellent standard, in a great central location that doesn't require you to leave an arm when paying then this hotel fits the bill - although served with a lift there are some steps still to negotiate so if you have difficulty with steps then you should request a ground floor room which I am sure they will try to accommodate",April 2019,Palazzo Barocci,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187870-d286614-Reviews-Palazzo_Barocci-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5
Don't believe any of the 5 star reviews this is a CON,"we met the guide Miss Donata and then took the water taxi to Murano, she had no interaction and absolutely nothing to say. we arrived at Murano and escorted inside to a glass blowing exhibition followed by the ""factory shop"" Miss Donata re-appeared and escorted us to a boat to travel to Burano to see ""an example of lace making"" - some old bird doing a bit of needlepoint. The guide disappeared again. we got back on the boat to be told we were now going back to Venice, sorry but what happened to the third island? answer ""you spent too long in the glass factory and we don't have time"" - sorry, did you at any point advice us of the time to be spent in each location? - having remonstrated with her she said ""anyway the Church is closed now so you can't go in but we can drive past the island"" I ask what is the value of driving past the island and in which case to take us back to Venice answer ""you said it was a three island tour"" - what sort of response is that? did you only understand ""take them to a glass factory and a lace shop and you'll get a cut of what they buy""?. so without further comment the boat stops at Torcello, we have no idea what is going on and have already been told the Church is closed I insist we return to Venice - this tour is a con, no information about the islands and the only one worth visiting from an historical viewpoint was deleted. we were not given any time in Murano or directed to any points of interest and the whole experience was a costly mistake.",April 2019,"Private Excursion by Typical Venetian Motorboat to Murano, Burano and Torcello",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187870-d11460006-Private_Excursion_by_Typical_Venetian_Motorboat_to_Murano_Burano_and_Torcello-Veni.html,"Venice, Italy",activities,1.0,4.5
Great setting - a point off for the food,"firstly this is expensive so if you are looking for a cheap meal stop here. the setting is stunning but if you book late at night it might be best to ensure the torch on your phone works as the gardens are quite dark and the walkways can be slippery. that said the beauty of the restaurant could not be faulted. the food however was a little dissapointing
firstly they brought an amuse bouche - it was a glass of cold tastless soup that could have come from a tin, one sip was enough - i ordered scallops for a starter, they were served with a delicious sauce but were slightly undercooked (I know it's difficult to get the exact cooking time for scallops but then at these prices they should be perfect). The starter was followed by a sorbet - unfortunatley they had included lumps of fruit in the sorbet which rather made it like an early desert rather than a palate cleaner. the main course was very dissapointing. I ordered the corn fed chicken which was completely tasteless. it was served with a giant mushroom slice which had been overcooked and was like a piece of rubber (i had to ask for tissues to spit it out) the chips were so overseasoned they were challenging. For desert I chose the cheese, which was fine. when I raised with the manager the issue was immediately dealt with in a professional and polite manner and the main course was removed from the bill.",November 2018,The Beach Restaurant at The Chedi Muscat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1940497-d1036019-Reviews-The_Beach_Restaurant_at_The_Chedi_Muscat-Muscat_Muscat_Governorate.html,"Muscat, Oman",restaurants,4.0,4.5
amazing stay,"firstly the service was faultless from every member of staff, the room was very nicely laid out save that I am not a fan of a room that has only a glass screen to the toilet, nor an open wardrobe arrangement but they are personal issues. the bed was very comfortable and the layout of the room was in general well thought out. I had what was described as a superior room but as I think it was otherwise defined as the basic room I am not sure what it was superior to. as the rooms look over the family pool area I think it would be quite noisy in the school holidays so I would probably book an upgrade room in the other part of the hotel if fortunate enough to stay here again

the breakfast was a good selection of pretty much everything you could wish for and was a very high standard.

I had dinner at the beach restaurant which is a beautiful setting but heavy on the prices - and one dish in particular was disappointing
the long pool was really nice to swim in and as it was at one end of the resort it seemed that most people didn't bother to walk that far, the effect of that was I always managed to get a set of loungers to myself where as at the beach pool people were crammed into a smaller area which seemed to make no sense to me - good however that both of those pools are over 16s only

outstanding service,"ok it is a standard five star hotel - took a horizon luxury club room for four nights and the room was well equipped and spotlessly clean with an outstanding view over to the Grand Mosque. the club room again wouldn't win any interior design awards but the food was very well prepared with good range of choice. the pool area for me was a little too crowded - don't expect to find a bed at the pool after 2.00pm and too many (well at least 4) children managed to make enough noise for an army. I don't have anything against kinds as such but the pool is too small for both adults and children. it is a shame they didn't make one of the other pools exclusively for children - however the beach is steps away and a different world - beautiful sand and always a bed available.

the one point about this hotel however was the service. it was absolutely flawless - it was almost as if the staff anticipated what I wanted or needed even before I knew that I wanted or needed it and all done effortlessly. really couldn't have felt more welcome even down to the guys cleaning the rooms they simply couldn't have done better",October 2018,"Shangri-La Hotel, Qaryat Al Beri, Abu Dhabi",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294013-d656277-Reviews-Shangri_La_Hotel_Qaryat_Al_Beri_Abu_Dhabi-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,4.5
breathtaking building,"this building is simply breath taking and I don't usually get carried away with architecture. the feel of the entire building is sensational and complimented by the outstanding service from all the staff making in a very pleasurable visit.
on the down side I registered on the website but when trying to log in following the confirmation e mail it turned out to be impossible so I purchased the ticket from an agency. I noted previous comments on queues so was not best pleased when the scanner didn't work and the guy asked me to have a new ticket printed at the desk, there was in fact no queue at all. I visited early on a Friday morning and there were plenty of people in the Museum but no significant queue, I also checked on the way out some four hours later and again no queue to speak of. I'm sure it's probably a question of timing and you will either be lucky or unlucky
the exhibition itself was a little bit of a let down to be honest. the items on display were well researched (and it is really worth to take the audio guide as it is very informative) but what was on display was not exactly knock out - which is a bit of a shame given the money spent on the building - the porcelain on display for example was not special - I have better and older at home and for such a fabulous building they need to up their exhibit levels. I also found after the first few rooms the whole thing became a bit confused and random and felt to some extent the Emirati had been taken for a ride at no doubt vest expense - of course the jewel in the crown the Leonardo is not even on display and there's nothing that great to take its place - but if you find yourself if Abu Dhabi do go visit you won't regret it",October 2018,Louvre Abu Dhabi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294013-d12927120-Reviews-Louvre_Abu_Dhabi-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",attractions,5.0,4.5
fabulous start to journey,"when travelling out of Gatwick it is usually an early morning flight meaning getting out of bed at 4am and ending up with a lost day. I booked a VIP room at Bloc and couldn't have been happier
arrived around 6.30pm bought some M&S food, nice shower and into bed watching the planes coming in, drifted off very easily - room was lovely - soundproofing proved to be excellent, and the pleasure of walking out of the hotel and straight through security was bliss.

outstanding staff wonderful location,"from the moment you arrive you feel like an old friend, excellent service from all the staff that I encountered, the hotel is in fact a series of different units in different buildings which is not clear from their website and on that front a little dissapointing, I was in room Lhasa which was in fact a self contained apartment in a different building in a different street where you had your own key to the front door and to your apartment, there were effectively no ""hotel"" services in the building other than the daily cleaning. The apartment itself was nicely done with an adequate kitchen and bathroom a nice size bedroom and a compact sitting area, a steep flight of steps took you to the terrace and jacuzzi. breakfast was served in yet another building but personally I found that a bit disconcerting especially when you have to order in advance and I therefore skipped breakfast after the first visit (the food was good but personally I prefer to see it before I choose it), and as the pool is where you have the breakfast I didn't feel inclined to go back during the day when the pool was open. the staff however were very accommodating and I knew that had I needed anything that they would have dealt with it promptly and professionally, the location is of course fantastic and if you want privacy away from an hotel environment but with services at hand as required then the Lhasa apartment would be a good choice",August 2018,La Villa Marbella- Old Town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187439-d541333-Reviews-La_Villa_Marbella_Old_Town-Marbella_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html,"Marbella, Spain",hotels,5.0,5.0

amazing but the crowds are horrendous,"In theory I should have been giving the museums a full five stars there are some amazing things to see and the setting is stunning - however I booked early access tickets with breakfast in the Museum courtyard - by 8.00am another queue (that I assumed was the general access queue) was already snaking around the buildings, I asked the guide how long those people would have to wait and was frankly taken aback when she advised it was the early access queue without the breakfast.
It therefore seems that the Vatican are selling as many 8.00am “early access” tickets as they are selling general access tickets. Having the breakfast ticket did gain a little priority but quite frankly the breakfast was horrible – a typical range of eggs bacon and pancakes with some yogurt pots and average pastries served in what would only pass as a temporary tent. I understand that there is an even earlier access ticket at 6.45am (without the breakfast offering) and that may well be a better option if you want to miss the crowds.
The other issue with the breakfast is that as you pretty much have to eat the breakfast before you do the tour, you have wasted any advantage (no matter how small) of an early access.
The crowds by the time we reached the Sistine Chapel were dreadful, it made it virtually impossible to get any appreciation for the space and the rest of the tour was rendered useless as you were carried along on a tide of the momentum of other people, there was no real opportunity to stop and appreciate the beauty and artistry of the exhibits on show.
St Peter’s was far more enjoyable in that the crowds were considerably less and it is certainly impressive – sadly the concept of being hassled by immigrants hawking rosary beads in St Peter’s square brought to mind the biblical tale of merchants being thrown out of the temple – perhaps the Pope might want to read it sometime.",May 2018,Vatican Museums,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187793-d191000-Reviews-Vatican_Museums-Vatican_City_Lazio.html,"Vatican City, Italy",attractions,3.0,4.5
lives up to all the reviews,"as with most buildings in Marrakech the outside of the building is not jaw dropping (well not in a good sense) once you are through the door you are in an oasis of calm and beauty. You are of course greeted by John the owner for a little chat - well actually more like an interview but a very interesting guy. once you have passed the interview you get a guided tour of the two buildings that form the riad and you can't help but notice all of the attention to detail and the outstanding cleanliness. we had two rooms one on the ground adjacent to the swimming pool and my own room on the first floor (Hanan) was exquisitely decorated fabulously comfortable bed and all the little touches that makes a stay so much more enjoyable. It takes time to get used to the concept that you don't have a key to the room and it's not locked when you are out of the room but it is actually rather refreshing.
food was excellent all fresh and home cooked, breakfast is not the generalized buffet style -it is brought to you and the only choice you have to make is how you want your eggs - and of course just exactly how many of those pastries verges on greed. We ate most nights at the Riad as the food was exceptional and very well priced and you were pretty much guaranteed no tummy trouble!
the service was outstanding, nothing was too much trouble and everyone with a happy smile. it's a shame that the rest of the world appears to have forgotten good old fashioned service and manners but glad to say they are well and truly alive at Riad Hikaya.",May 2018,Riad Hikaya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293734-d4893996-Reviews-Riad_Hikaya-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",hotels,5.0,5.0
beautiful gardens shame about the tourists,"we made a special effort to go to the gardens at 8.00am when they open and were thankful that we did, apart from the usual Japanese tourists who appear to have the need to take a photo of every tree in the gardens and from several different angles, it was a beautiful time to visit, the gardens are certainly an oasis of calm although not overly large and probably not that great when the crowds descend. the only downside of going early is that the YSL museum does not open till 10.00am so it's either waiting for some time or missing out on it. we left the gardens after about an hour and the queues were already getting long!",May 2018,Jardin Majorelle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d477277-Reviews-Jardin_Majorelle-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",attractions,4.0,4.5
excellent choice but with some drawbacks,"This is far from an elegant five-star boutique hotel as one reviewer described it – it simply does not have the facilities to be such, it is certainly well located (but then perhaps the name might give that away) and the main part of the hotel is in an old building with some nice architectural features, however It would be fair to say that there are some drawbacks- having read previous reviews which criticised the other buildings of the hotel, I wanted to ensure that our rooms were in the main building, which the hotel accommodated. Unfortunately, in the main building you do have to negotiate a number of steps as the lift does not stop at all floors and certainly you would need to climb a relatively steep flight to get to the terrace on the top. It would probably be better therefore if you want to avoid steps that you stay in one of the other buildings. The second drawback was the standard of the breakfast, adequate but limited due to the small service area and with an awful lot of fruit flies (although I do understand that particular issue was in hand). Not really the standard I would expect
The rooms were nicely furnished but more flea market that antique and if the furniture had been painted as nicely as the ceiling it would have made a big difference. Equally the furniture in the conservatory/terrace was more old people’s home than stylish and that was a disappointment for a five-star hotel in Italy. We had two rooms one of which had a balcony overlooking what was ambitiously described as a courtyard – I don’t think overlooking a whole load of air-conditioning units was particularly a courtyard experience but then the bonus of a balcony was very nice. My final issue was the toiletries, they simply didn’t smell! – some guests may like that, but it seems pointless to supply a designer brand product with no scent, particularly when I have stayed in hotels using the same brand and which were certainly scented.
All that said the one absolutely outstanding aspect of this hotel (and the reason I give it 5 stars) was the staff. There was not one member of them who didn’t deliver absolutely top-grade service, from the time of booking there was regular email contact, all requests were dealt with and nothing was too much trouble. If you needed anything at all there always seemed to be a member of staff right there to help without them being intrusive – a really big well done to all of them.",April 2018,The Inn At The Spanish Steps,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d229087-Reviews-The_Inn_At_The_Spanish_Steps-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5

Filthy hotel with incompetent management,"15 years ago this might have been quite a nice place to stay, but apart from a few of the staff being pleasant the rest of the experience was awful.
On entering the room (allegedly luxury room with sea view) , it felt tired and gloomy – the bathroom a hybrid between average hotel and public convenience was dated and dirty, there was a limited sea view through the unwashed windows. I then went to the Bliss lounge for lunch.
This beach lounge/bar was much hyped in the hotel website as an Ibiza style chill lounge – to be fair the music was ok but the place was pretty deserted only the Neville and Evonne from Morley type, him in his M&S elasticated waist shorts from circa 1982 and her in an exotic sarong which she probably purloined from the market stalls of Bradford some years past. All of the cushions in the lounge were sun damaged and featured several cigarette burns – all dreadfully tired. The food was nothing special
On return to the room I decided to look more closely at the bed as it looked generally crumpled – the duvet cover wasn’t nicely ironed and neither were the sheets but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that this was due to their advanced years. There were two duvets on the bed (God knows why it was 30 degrees outside) the thinner of the two was so old the insides had all disintegrated into congealed lumps and was badly stained – picture attached if you can stomach it – I removed it from the bed
I then looked more carefully at the bathroom, apart from the general tiredness of the room some of the tiles had been “re” grouted and extremely badly, the sink surround did not appear recently wiped and there was a half-used miniature of body lotion left on the tray. There was what I thought was a cracked wall tile.
I went to reception to return the half bottle of body lotion – they looked at me as if I was asking them to stand on their heads and do the splits
Next morning, I went to breakfast, a particularly unappetizing offering pretty bog standard and with some ancient coffee machine.
When I returned to the room in the evening the first thing I noticed was that of all the items in the bathroom none of the items had been moved during that day’s cleaning, which meant the sink surface could not have been cleaned, the shower gel bottles that I had used in the morning were still sitting in the tray in the bath although they were empty which meant the bath had not been cleaned at all and I am not certain that it had been cleaned before I moved into the room. On further inspection of the cracked tile, I realized it was in fact a hair of a previous occupant. I returned to reception and listed the complaints
I was offered an alternative room (not that the duty manager could be bothered to show the room himself it was obviously beneath him and he called over a porter to escort me) the new room had the same gloomy tired feel and I didn’t see the point in packing my luggage to move from one gloomy room to another, I pointed out that all I wanted was a clean bathroom and the dirty duvet removed. The manager said “Sir, I will arrange some amenities in the room as a gesture of goodwill” - I was going to the ballet and I asked if the bathroom in particular could be cleaned whilst I was out, I was assured this would be done
When I arrived back after the ballet, housekeeping had indeed visited the room, the bath had been cleaned and the “amenities” left – these turned out to be a plastic razor and an extra SANITARY bag – I am not sure what that gesture was meant to mean, the hair on the wall was still there
Back to reception, complaint number 3, the night manager came to the room and took photos of the offending hair and other issues such as something unpleasant stuck to the tv unit and gave a personal assurance that the room would be thoroughly cleaned, as I was meeting a friend for a drink I said the following morning would be ok
The incident in the breakfast room the next morning was quite frankly dreadful. I was ignored when I entered the room that of itself didn’t bother me, I went and made a selection from the buffet and then tried the aged coffee machine only for it to tell me for every button pressed “selected drink not available” I sat down, one waiter in the room was joined by one waitress, they ignored everyone in the room and chose to stand chatting by the entrance desk. After some 10 minutes I approached them and said “sorry to disturb you but can I have a coffee” – the response from the waitress was not “I’m sorry sir, yes of course blah blah blah” but a flat “yes”, she then proceeded to repeat what I had said to four colleagues who all stood in the room looking in my direction and laughing – she then eventually got up and brought the coffee (probably having spit in it first)
I spent most of the day at the beach watching the crows peck more of the stuffing out of the extremely old cushions on the sunbeds – these are really disgusting and any hotel would be embarrassed to have them on display
when I returned to the room in the evening after it had been cleaned, the hair was still on the wall and the filthy old duvet has been put back on the bed, back to reception complaint number 4, 8.00pm the manager from the previous evening rings to ask if they can come and clean the room – I pointed out that he had given his personal assurance it would have been done in the morning so given their inability to arrange the simplest matter of cleaning it could stay where it was (and its probably still there today)
Day 4 of hairgate I’m feeling strangely attached to the hair and wonder if I should pack it as a souvenir
Checking out they ask if I enjoyed my stay???? – are they mad???- another manager appears again apologizing and stating all my complaints have been passed further up – presumably so that someone further up can also do absolutely nothing at all to address the horror that is this hotel

stunning building,"the building from the outside and the common parts are undoubtedly stunning as would be expected, the auditorium is pretty much just a larger version of the Festival Hall London, I wasn't blown away as much as I thought I would be - the art style is a little passé and the seating whilst comfortable with plenty of leg room the red leather seats were rather reminiscent of Soviet era East Berlin - sorry that's how I see it
Saw the Ballet Russes, I do not profess to be a ballet expert but I've seen enough to know that the Russian troupes are very good but better at the full-on visual of costumes and set rather than the technical dancing, the first section was average, the second part was impressive but because it involved more gymnastic moves than traditional ballet - still an enjoyable evening worth seeing - and if you do go you should dress up - lots of girls in full length evening dresses, but gents not a tux unless its a gala evening it looks way too pretentious",November 2017,Dubai Opera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295424-d10825690-Reviews-Dubai_Opera-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",attractions,4.0,4.5
beautiful building good performance,"went to see the ballet here, ok if you are used to seeing the world's best dancers at ROH or the Met you are not going to be blown away here, the performances are great but not world class
that said the venue is very pretty and ornate and the staff were all very helpful and attentive. there was a certain element of provinciality about it - the patrons were very casually dressed (by which I mean poorly dressed) which given some of my French friends had said it was quite dressy was a little surprising and dressed as I would for any smart occasion I felt entirely overdressed. The interval drink which was primarily champagne served in a champagne coupe was overly dry and not particularly pleasant but at 5 euros a glass was inexpensive for an opera house
the biggest drawback was the heat in the auditorium which was quite stuffy and uncomfortable but a consequence of a building of its age

excellent food is lovely surrounding,"this restaurant was recommended by my driver and I wouldn't usually pick a restaurant on a main square as they are often overpriced and poor quality. however as it had been recommended we took the plunge. as it was a rather warm evening we sat outside, the service and the food were top class - really well presented delicious food, superb wine and at less than £40 per person not overly expensive - the inside of the restaurant is very ornately decorated and definately a choice in the winter months - left feeling well fed and very satisfied - the only downside was it was quite difficult to make a choice of what to eat as everything sounded good!",October 2017,Le Bibent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187175-d942408-Reviews-Le_Bibent-Toulouse_Haute_Garonne_Occitanie.html,"Toulouse, France",restaurants,5.0,4.0
excellent place for quality lunch,"was recommended this restaurant by some French friends who live in Luchon and I was not disappointed, the food was excellent, freshly cooked well presented wholesome and very tasty, wine was excellent and service very good, all in all a very pleasant experience at a fair price which was the agreed conclusion of a party of four - will definitely visit again next time I'm in town",October 2017,Le Glacier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g4662666-d2640217-Reviews-Le_Glacier-Bagneres_de_Luchon_Haute_Garonne_Occitanie.html,"Bagneres-de-Luchon, France",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Great for famlies and couples,"This will be a confused review in that I give 5 stars but would never stay here again.

My reasons for giving 5 stars are that the hotel itself is beautiful, the common parts very attractive and the room (king size deluxe) was really nicely laid out lovely large comfortable bed and all the amenities I expect from a 5*. The toiletries and fresh water were frequently replenished and the room was kept spotless. My only issue with the room was the large double wardrobe had extremely limited hanging space – possibly 6 hangers at best which as I travel to be able to dress for any occasion and often mix business and leisure was too little for me as a single occupant let alone a couple.

the service at the hotel was first class, the staff were all trying to go that extra mile to make guests happy and to exceed their expectations, even in the breakfast room my choice of black coffee was delivered after the first day without the need to ask for it. Breakfast itself was well catered with a wide choice of everything you could possibly want

the hotel is sited nicely on a white sandy beach which is private to the hotel and well maintained.

So despite all of that there are two downsides for me, firstly Ajman itself has little to offer, the hotel isn’t located where you can walk out of the front door and visit shops or places on interest on foot, if you have done all of the trips you would want to do in the Emirates then you are pretty much going to stay in the hotel. Secondly for some reason (which I hadn’t picked up on when I booked) the hotel does all-inclusive and it was absolutely heaving with German and Russian families (and if you think the Germans are skilled at reserving sun beds with towels at daybreak the Russians take it to a whole new level) the problem that it creates is that the sun deck and beach facilities are tight for the size of the hotel, the beach frontage is quite narrow so grabbing a prime sunbed needs to be done at 6.00am and by 9.00am you will be out of luck. The gardens are nice but they are completely stuffed with sun loungers and I personally don’t like that feeling of being cramped into the space. There is a volley ball net placed in front of the first row of the sunbeds on the beach so if you are in the front row and the Russian volley ball team decide they are going to play you are going to get covered in sand and with no apologies, so I would strongly suggest the hotel remove the net and put out a further line of sun loungers

Food and drink service at the beach was excellent but the prices are expensive and the quality is very much all-inclusive – large portions of tasty but average standard food.

I understand the hotel is comparatively inexpensive (it was part of a combined deal so I don’t know if that is correct) and if you are a family wanting to holiday in the Emirates in a good hotel with excellent service on an all-inclusive basis then this may well be an excellent choice. For a single traveller it is less attractive unless you have a desire to be trapped in that very much family environment",October 2017,"Ajman Saray, a Luxury Collection Resort, Ajman",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298060-d5565303-Reviews-Ajman_Saray_a_Luxury_Collection_Resort_Ajman-Ajman_Emirate_of_Ajman.html,"Ajman, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,4.5
Nice warm water full of debris,I was quite frankly surprised at the amount of debris floating in the sea off the Ajman coast - beautiful beaches but I can't recall ever swimming in the sea where you are constantly entangled in plastic carrier bags and worse - the peasant families who take their toddlers into the sea with no swim wear (and there are hoards of them) are not bothered as to what they leave behind - so best to swim with your mouth shut - needs more attention,October 2017,Ajman Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298060-d5963977-Reviews-Ajman_Beach-Ajman_Emirate_of_Ajman.html,"Ajman, United Arab Emirates",attractions,3.0,4.0
sumptious afternoon tea,"I've always liked the conservatory at Harrods and took some friends for lunch, we were seduced by the afternoon tea (not cheap at £40 per head) but a full offering of tasty sandwiches (refilled as many times as you need) scones with a full selection of jams and cream and cakes, I do think at that price supplying only one cake per person felt a little stingy and a wider offering of perhaps smaller cakes would have been more appealing
you do need however a good 2 hours to digest it all so its not really suitable for a quick lunch
service as expected was excellent from all the staff",October 2017,The Terrace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1487036-Reviews-The_Terrace-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"delicious food,elegant surroundings fabulouse service","if you want to go to a place where the music is so noisy you can't hear yourself think, be surrounded by loud mouthed, ignorant attitude driven chavs then there are plenty of clubs and ""trendy"" restaurants to go to. However if you want understated sophistication, would like to engage with your fellow diners in a meaningful conversation whilst being delivered perfect food by happy smiling staff then you will be hard pressed to find somewhere better than this
. from the moment we walked through the door we were greeted like old friends, nothing was too much trouble - the service from start to finish was excellent and each dish was perfect. Even being a late sitting we didn't feel in the least hurried. Of course, perfection comes at a price, but I've paid more for worse and the wine list here was actually well priced - will definitely revisit",September 2017,Roux At The Landau,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1064961-Reviews-Roux_At_The_Landau-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
pleasantly shocked!,"my past experience of Hilton as a brand has not been overwhelming so I didn't have great expectations of the Newcastle airport one. I picked it as I was coming in on a late flight and needed to be close to the airport so as this is as close as you can get without sleeping in the terminal it was the logical choice
from the check in to the check out this was an entirely perfect experience, the staff were all lovely (which is nothing less than I expect from Newcastle) the room was very well furnished - clean and extremely quiet - all in all a very nice nights sleep",August 2017,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Newcastle International Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g652384-d2414542-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_Newcastle_International_Airport-Woolsington_Newcastle_upon_.html,"Woolsington, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
