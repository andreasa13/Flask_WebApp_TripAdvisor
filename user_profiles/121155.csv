interesting,"We went to see this on the combination ticket and it was interesting to see what's left of the Roman ruins. The Tower of the Winds is interesting as it was built as a water clock. Also the ruins of a ""public latrine"" was source of amusement for my son! Not a lot of tourists so- no crowds thankfully!",November 2019,Roman Agora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242841-Reviews-Roman_Agora-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
best preserved temple,"this temple is located in the Roman Agora. You can't go inside the temple itself,but it still is a beautiful site to visit. It is amazing how intact it is after all these years! There are many ruins of buildings and statues in the Roman Agora. Plan on walking around 1-2 hours.",November 2019,Temple of Hephaestus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1064133-Reviews-Temple_of_Hephaestus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Classic Greece!,This is a must- see if traveling to Athens. It is a long climb up to the top but worth it for the view of Athens alone. The ruins of the temples are amazing to think they are over 2000 years old! There is ongoing reconstruction so be prepared for scaffolding and workmen on the site.The stones at the top are very slippery so wear good grip shoes! It would be helpful to have more signage indicating what everything is but so much is available online nowadays I guess that's a moot point! Buy your tickets online for 10 euro and avoid the long lines at the ticket booth.If you buy a combination ticket it will get you into 6-7 other sites around Athens including the Acropolis and costs 30 Euro!,November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
excellent location!,"this is my second stay at this hotel and it did not disappoint! It has a nice breakfast buffet with eggs, bacon, hams and cheeses,fresh and cooked vegetables, breads and pastries,fresh fruits, cereal and the best creamy Greek yogurt with honey! Coffee, tea, juices and milk to drink. Although, the elevator is a little slow and it only fits 4 people!And as noted in other posts there is no locked area to store your luggage. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The rooms are adequate size and very clean. Nice closets to store your clothes/luggage. we had a very small balcony with 2 chairs and a small table to watch the street life of Athens. It has a great rooftop restaurant with a beautiful view of the Acropolis lit up at night!! It is located about a block away from the Acropolis museum and a couple more blocks from the Acropolis! There are many restaurants in the area and it is very close to the Plaka area.",November 2019,Hera Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d240838-Reviews-Hera_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent location!! within walking distance to all major attractions!,"We were very happy with this hotel!. We were greeted and welcomed to the city. check in was a breeze. Our room was in the front of the hotel and for the most part was quiet enough to sleep. Traffic was busier in the daytime but then that's not when we were sleeping! We had a very tiny balcony-barely enough room for a table and 2 chairs but it was pleasant to sit out there in the morning/evening for a look at the city.The room was in good condition, the only exception being the cracked toilet tank lid. There was good water pressure for the shower. There is small fridge with drinks and snacks but we didnt touch those. A bottle of water per person per day was complimentary. Breakfast was good with choices of cold meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, hot eggs(boiled and fried) sausages, bacon and the most delicious Greek yogurt with fruit, nuts and honey as additives. Juices and coffee/tea were good. It's set in a very nice room that looks like a garden room. We had dinner in the rooftop restaurant which has a great view of the Acropolis! Food was good and not overly pricey. One particular worker, Felli, was a joy to meet! She was a very hard worker and tried to assure all her customers were well taken care of!! Very sweet and personable! I also want to thank the man at the checkin counter(sorry I didn't get his name) who helped arrange transportation to the airport when my booked transport failed to show up! ""Always book through the hotel"" he told me.....lesson learned!! They also kept our luggage for us overnight when we checked out and went on an overnight tour so we could just take an overnight bag and not have to drag the big bags with us! The location was perfect as we could go out for a couple of hours and stop back at the hotel to rest or drop off purchases and be right back in the middle of things in minutes. There is a bank and a car rental place just one block away. Best part was it is so close to the Acropolis-just about two blocks!! I would absolutely stay here again if I ever come back to Athens!!",April 2017,Hera Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d240838-Reviews-Hera_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
great view of the Acropolis,food was good and the view was great! No one rushed you out if you just wanted a drink or dessert. you could sit and admire the view!,April 2017,Peacock Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3709505-Reviews-Peacock_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
upscale restaurant,food was very good but small portions. It is up a winding staircase so very inaccessible to someone with walking difficulty.,April 2017,Mani Mani,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d695929-Reviews-Mani_Mani-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
best meal I had in Athens!,The authentic moussaka(without the bechamel sauce) I had was the best meal in Athens! the presentation was beautiful but the taste was heavenly! And I can't say enough about the servers! they were all genuinely friendly and interested in talking to you. We had a wonderful time there and would recommend it to others. You have a lot of choices along this street- I'd definitelyl go back again!,April 2017,Arcadia Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1501262-Reviews-Arcadia_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
well preserved temple,most of the temple is still wholly intact so you get a good feel of how it looked. It is in the Ancient Agora so you get to see all the ruins of other temples and buildings.,April 2017,Temple of Hephaestus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1064133-Reviews-Temple_of_Hephaestus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
good and interesting museum,small museum- takes about an hour to go through but has some great displays of artifacts from the Viking era. The ruins of the Viking longhouse was great as it displays the scale of the original building. Interactive computer display was fun to use to learn more about the Vikings/early Icelandic settlers. In a small room there were original ancient books displayed writing about the sagas of the early settlers.,September 2016,The Settlement Exhibition,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189970-d2414517-Reviews-The_Settlement_Exhibition-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",attractions,4.0,4.5
Don't miss this!!,I wasn't sure about a bowl of noodles being anything special but I was pleasantly surprised! It was very good! It was not very expensive (for Iceland) and really did fill me up. Very comforting to have a hot bowl of noodles when it's cold and rainy outside. I got the vegetable soup with extra noodles and added roasted garlic and crushed peanuts and it was delicious! My son who loves food spicy- the hotter the better-got it very spicy and it was a little too spicy even for him!! Was so good( and affordable) that we went back another night.,September 2016,Noodle Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d2400356-Reviews-Noodle_Station-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,4.0
small clean beach area,since we went in late sept there was no one at the beach. we could see the area where the hot springs bubbles up in the water fairly close to shore but it was too cold to go in. I suppose it's nice when you can actually swim there. There is a separate pool area that is filled with hot water from the thermal springs but that was already drained for the season.,September 2016,Nautholsvik Geothermal Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189970-d1657067-Reviews-Nautholsvik_Geothermal_Beach-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",attractions,3.0,4.0
main shopping area,"Long street filled with shops, restaurants etc. Popular area after dark for all the bars!

amazing architecture!,"this is a very interesting and intriguing building. The outside ""honeycomb""shaped windows reflect the water and the city and some panels are iridescent. There is a gift shop on the first floor(pricey!). In the lower floor there is a 30 minute 360 degree movie showcasing the vast and different areas of Iceland that is well done. It's costs about 13USD. Wander around the upper floors. It's a visual treat!",September 2016,Harpa Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189970-d2108615-Reviews-Harpa_Reykjavik_Concert_Hall_and_Conference_Centre-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",attractions,4.0,4.5
average hotel,"It is in a good location- near enough to the main shopping street to walk but far enough away from the night time bar hoppers. Good but basic European breakfast: cold meats and cheeses, hardboiled eggs, yogurts, fruit, tomatoes, cereals and some hot sausages and eggs. One really good standout for me was a thick slice of the fresh baked bread, still warm, that was delicious with jam! We had a family room-pull out couch(not very comfortable) and a loft bedroom up the spiral staircase which had two twin beds pushed together to make a full size. I have seen this many times in my European travels so it didn't bother me. The bathroom was small but clean. Overall the hotel was clean and the staff was very pleasant and helpful.. .One thing I was really not happy about was they have no public computer to print out boarding passes for airlines. I did check in on my phone but I always like to have a hard copy as I have witnessed people not being able to get their phones to work when they are boarding and having to run to the desk to get paper boarding passes! I would choose to stay here again if I ever go back!",September 2016,Fosshotel Raudara,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189970-d228919-Reviews-Fosshotel_Raudara-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",hotels,3.0,4.0
great views from the top,"Landmark for the city. you can orient yourself from anywhere as long as you can see the church. going up in the tower was good for an overall view of the city. costs about 8USD. Elevator takes you up, but to get to the very top, you have to climb a couple of flights of stairs.",September 2016,Hallgrimskirkja,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189970-d245998-Reviews-Hallgrimskirkja-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",attractions,3.0,4.5
interesting sculpture,It is located right on the waterfront of the city. You can almost imagine it as a Viking ship!

Iceland French Fries!,They serve only french fries in 3-4 different sizes with your choice of dips. Since everything is so expensive in Reyjavik this was a quick and relatively cheap snack. I paid about 8USD for a medium. the fries are thick and quite good but I'd never pay that much for them in the States!,September 2016,Reykjavik Chips,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d8397206-Reviews-Reykjavik_Chips-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,3.0,4.5
pleasantly surprised!,"the pizza was delicious-creative toppings that were cooked just right. tables are small so they use a device to keep the pizza off the table so you still have room to eat. I had the gnocchi which was good but a little heavy( my mother used to make these and they were MUCH lighter) The sauce was good- didn't taste like it came out of a can-very fresh and"" tomatoey"". Lots of fresh herbs too. They have a good sized menu so I plan to go back and try some other dishes! Very small place with limited seating so get there early for dinner or late for lunch.

So much fun!!,"they pick you up not far from the ferry which was convenient. the guides were terrific!!! they made us feel completely comfortable and safe. there is a short ""training"" line before you go out to the trees so you will get a feel for the zipline. that was helpful. you are secured into a harness and hooked onto each line.( it is a series of zip lines). You are never forced or pushed into doing something if you don't want to. It was a BLAST!! had so much fun I wanted to do it again!",October 2015,Zip San Juan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60957-d2172568-Reviews-Zip_San_Juan-Friday_Harbor_San_Juan_Island_San_Juan_Islands_Washington.html,"San Juan Island, Washington",attractions,5.0,5.0
Don't miss this!!,"I enjoyed this tour very much! This was a well run, fun and exciting tour. Sam, our driver was exuberant, informative and funny. We got to see many horses running right on the beach! We also drove on the beach and around sand dunes. The ride was windy and bouncy but securely seatbelted into our seats I felt perfectly safe. I saw some other companies with wide open flatbed trucks with seats on them and was very thankful I was in a comfortable ride! I do have to say though it may be a bit difficult for less agile people to get into the back seats but they do a good job of helping people in and putting more ""frail"" people up front. It was worth the price.!",April 2015,Wild Horse Adventure Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g49058-d1093487-Reviews-Wild_Horse_Adventure_Tours-Corolla_Outer_Banks_North_Carolina.html,"Corolla, North Carolina",attractions,5.0,5.0
"nice, but not outstanding","our accommodations were nice, the room was clean and up to date. The bathroom door was a slider and it didn't close all the way. maybe fine if travelilng with family but I was traveling with a co-worker! the doors to the hallway closet blocked the hall and anyone trying to get to the bathroom which was annoying.

worth the walk,"Walked from riverwalk and it was a pleasant walk in the morning. The restaurant was great! Nice old house that you can tour. Breakfast was delicious. Homemade pancakes were fluffy and light. Breakfast burritos were filled with eggs and bacon. Fresh fruit accompanied the plate. Service was brisk and they kept your coffee cup filled. Ate out on the patio and was very nice setting. Watch the tables though, they are Victorian style with no glass covering the intricate pattern. If you spill coffee on the table it goes right into your lap!

great place on the riverwalk,"The hotel was clean, fresh and beautifully decorated. Everyone was friendly, helpful and polite. The rooms were good size and the beds very comfortable. The balcony was a little small. (Would've liked to put a chair out there.) Their breakfast buffet was delicious and had everything from eggs, fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, pastries and oatmeal. Eating out on the patio early in the morning was a delight as the air was cool and not many people walking around. The location was perfect as it is right on the riverwalk but away from the rowdy bars/restaurants farther down the river. Pool was small but perfect for a cool dip. Would definitely stay here again if in the San Antonio area.",September 2011,"The Westin Riverwalk, San Antonio",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60956-d99535-Reviews-The_Westin_Riverwalk_San_Antonio-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",hotels,5.0,4.5
Well done development of the river,"They did a good job with the development of the riverwalk. It is pleasant to walk along. There are beautiful flowers and waterfalls to look at. It seems everytime we went by we found somethng new that we hadn't seen before. It does get crowded on Friday and Saturday nights so sometimes it's a little hard to navigate. There are plenty of food establishments all along the way. However if you go up one of the staircases from the riverwalk we found there were many places (usually cheaper) on the street level that are not well advertised. Also be advised if you take the extended river barge up to the Pearl Brewery there is not much there. It is still ""in development"". We were disappointed the Culinary bakery was closed on Monday(when we were there of course) but no one told us when we were on the barge what was open and closed. The whole shopping area was closed on Sunday.! It would have been helpful to know that when planning to visit. The art installations along the way were okay. Seeing the bats fly out at dusk was awesome!",September 2011,San Antonio River Walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60956-d105056-Reviews-San_Antonio_River_Walk-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",attractions,4.0,4.5

The iconic umbrellas of the Riverwalk!,This is the place you see most often when you see the riverwalk. We at lunch here and it was surprisingly good. The location couldn't be any better! You see all the barges passing by and everyone taking pictures. The only thing I didn't like was being solicited by the mariachi band for $10/song! I think they should just play and be paid by the restaurant.

perfect breakfast spot!,"Ate out on the patio several times this month. The setting by the waterfront is beautiful. Sitting under the pergola was a treat! Decorated with pink flowers and vines, it is exactly what I would want my backyard to be. Service was inconsistent, sometimes very efficient, other times very disorganized and slow. (Had to wait 10 minutes after pancakes delivered for syrup.) Food was fantastic. Lots of fresh ingredients and presentation was great. I did try lunch and was not as impressed.

avoid this place,"Our room was on the 3rd floor-no elevator, the room was barely adequate(polyester sheets with holes in it), the breakfast very basic(warm orange juice, coffee, tomato slices, ham and cheese and bread), but the rudeness of the owner was deplorable. He became loud and threatening when we were checking out. We had pre-paid but he insisted we hadn't paid anything and wouldn't let us leave until we paid again. I paid just to get away from there.
