Ancient Synagogue in Rhodes worth the visit,So glad we stopped to see this synagogue that is rarely used anymore. It was beautifully maintained and had some unusual things in it such as an olive wood 10 commandments on a column and a lyre of David on the back wall. It is a shame that there are only about 20 Jews left in Rhodes now. So glad they have preserved this synagogue. Gift shop was nice too.,November 2019,Kahal Kadosh Shalom Synagogue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g635613-d4988886-Reviews-Kahal_Kadosh_Shalom_Synagogue-Rhodes_Town_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Great way to learn about the history of the Jews in Greece,"This is a lovely little museum, four levels of information about the Jews of Greece throughout history. The exhibits are well done and include lots of information about the Holocaust including a short film with stories by survivors. The exhibits could be a little more informative, but I think you can get a headset that provides more information than what is marked on the display cases.

My husband had the matza ball soup which was also delicious. Every meal is served with a bread basket with a variety of breads and muffins. For the main course, I had the open face Reuben with coleslaw and 1000 island dressing and my husband had the chicken sandwich. Enormous portions at moderate prices.

We also saw the Lunero show that was there and enjoyed it. The pool area is nice...wish there were more of a beach adjacent to the hotel.

"Pretty Home, well done tour, free if you eat in the Castle Restaurant on the grounds","We enjoyed this tour. it is not as extensive as some of the other tours because this is a working B&B and you can only tour the first floor which is also open to guests of the B&B while they are there. Would love to go back and maybe stay here. The meal at the Castle was good, nothing great. Prices were excellent. And, the sweet potato muffins are delish.",April 2018,Dunleith Historic Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60910-d12240878-Reviews-Dunleith_Historic_Inn-Natchez_Mississippi.html,"Natchez, Mississippi",attractions,3.0,4.0
Did not tour house because we did not have time to wait until next tour. Grounds are pretty and house looked nice.,We arrived at an off time and did not want to wait until the next tour. I was disappointed that what looked like a nice gift shop was closed because the person working in it was leading a tour. Wish someone else had been there to open the shop...we probably would have made a purchase. The house looked nice and well maintained from the outside. The columns are now painted a yellow-beige color to look like faux marble (instead of white). We walked around the grounds for a while because it was a nice day. Will have to go back to see the house.,April 2018,Melrose,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60910-d107299-Reviews-Melrose-Natchez_Mississippi.html,"Natchez, Mississippi",attractions,2.0,4.5
Beautifully maintained synagogue is a hidden gem in Cochin,The Kadavum Bagam Synagogue is hidden behind a tropical fish store and owned by a private citizen who purchased the land in order to maintain the synagogue. We had a private tour with Babu (the owner). He owns the tropical fish and plant store that you must walk through in order to get to the synagogue. He has restored and maintained the synagogue beautifully and it was lovely to see. He deserves much praise for preserving this important part of history.,February 2018,Kadavum Bagam Synagogue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297633-d12657607-Reviews-Kadavum_Bagam_Synagogue-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html,"Kochi (Cochin), India",attractions,5.0,4.5
Well worth seeing on a trip to Kochi,"This ancient Palace is well worth seeing to learn about the history of the people of Kochi and the Maharajas. The woodwork is magnificent and there are beautiful murals as well. It is located next to the Maharaja's Temple which is not open for touring. But, you can learn alot about the history of the area from touring the palace which has been converted to a museum.",February 2018,Mattancherry Palace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297633-d325097-Reviews-Mattancherry_Palace-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html,"Kochi (Cochin), India",attractions,4.0,4.0

"Amazing site, not to be missed","This tour was so worthwhile. We took a ferry to this island with ancient caves containing a Shiva Temple. All carved out of a single rock, it is an amazing and massive site to behold. Definitely hire a guide to tell you all the details about the carvings. There are over 100 steps leading up to the cave. I paid approximately $32 to have 4 men carry me up and down in a Sudan chair. Definitely an experience! There are lots of booths along the way wear where you can purchase trinkets and souvenirs.",February 2018,Elephanta Caves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304554-d311664-Reviews-Elephanta_Caves-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",attractions,5.0,4.0
Purchased lots of gifts and custom clothing here,"Chouhan waited on me and treated me like a queen. He was patient and caring. He helped me select lots of gift items...scarves, pillow covers, table runners. And I selected fabric to have several clothing items made which were delivered to my hotel that evening perfectly crafted. So happy with purchases I made.
