Bland Gyro Plate,"We visited the Olympia Ancient Ruins and the Olympia Museum on 2/27/2020. In early afternoon, the rains came. Many tourists had the same idea to get out of the rain by having lunch. Ambrosia Garden restaurant seems to be the closest eatery. With others going in, we followed. The restaurant was filling up quickly. We got a cramp table upstair in the loft area. We chose their gyro lunch plate special for around 10 euros each along with ten ounce Fanta soda & Sprite soda bottles for around 2.5 euros each. Gyro meat was laid on top of a bed of potato fried with a flat pita bread underneath both. Meat was on the dry side and the sauce bland. The side salad was nothing to rave about either. We were expecting tastier Greek food when eating in Greece. Service was hurried as if they want you to leave ASAP.",February 2020,Ambrosia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1588218-d13336603-Reviews-Ambrosia-Amaliada_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Amaliada, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.0

A spectacular classical Greek ancient ruin city, only discovered in the mid 1800’s, is being excavated, preserved and restored even now. Over the eons, the city has been attacked, conquered and rebuilt by Romans. There was so much to see that you need a day there. Much of the ruins, estimated 80%, are still buried. Most impressive was the famed Library of Celsus built in 123 AD. Also don’t miss the amphitheater where St. Paul preached, the gates of Hercules and the stone relief of victory goddess Nike which inspired the Nike swoosh.

Also the street are lined with small cobble stones which prevent invaders using horses. Horses loose tractions on these cobble stones surface.

When you walk up to it, you have to be awed for the human labor needed to erect this massive pyramid. We also visited the other two adjacent pyramids too. We elected not to go inside the one pyramid that was allowed entrance, ($8 USD - a separate ticket). We also went over to see the Great Sphinx of Giza close by. Unlike the pyramids where you can touch them, visitors cannot go up close to the Sphinx. On your way there you pass by the mummification temple. We were in Egypt in early March. The weather there in the Sahara Desert wasn’t hot at all. Now for the negative. You will encounter many super aggressive vendors-peddlers. They just don’t take no for answer. Whether they want to sell you something, put something “free” on you, stand by you for a photo, they will reach for your camera or cellphone from you to take photographs, they says they will tell you how to take best photos, they will sell you a camel ride … they won’t take no for answer. Understandably because they are impoverished, they need your money. Nonetheless still very annoying and they can become obnoxious when you ignore them. If you want to ride a camel, be sure to negotiate the price ahead of time, and only pay after you get off the camel.

LAX Marriott,"To reduce stress of rushing to LAX in order to avoid missing our flights, we tried out their “Park & Stay” package at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott.

Considering the retail airport parking rates for cover parking for that duration, the dollar amount seemed fair. Hotel’s shuttle buses can drop you off at your terminal for departure and pick you up on return. You can text the hotel to have your car ready as soon as you fetch your luggages. The weren’t any shuttle buses for return pickup around 6 p.m. on a weeknight. Had to wait for more than 30 minutes before one showed up.
