great to stroll around after walking down from the Acropolis,"Fun place to stroll around. I found a Greek/Arab restaurant and ate a great lunch there. Sorry I don't remember the name of the restaurant & I paid by cash so I can't look it up on a receipt, but they gave me a lot of food:-) Nice, relaxing time & atmosphere.",March 2019,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
My favorite restaurant in Athens,"The service was excellent. The Manager, Servers, and Cooks were all so nice! I had two servers because I stayed there a long time for dinner, taking my time to enjoy the wonderful atmosphere. I had a window table with a good view of the neighborhood outside, which was even more enjoyable with the extra big glass of red wine they generously poured for me. I ordered a full-course meal with naan on the side and a yummy dessert to end with. I'm mostly vegetarian so everything was veggie for me! The best part was the service from the two gals (one was from Crete, the other Russia); I got to chat with them which was a big plus as I find the Greeks to be some of the friendliest people on earth.",March 2019,Zafran Indian Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d13833848-Reviews-Zafran_Indian_Kitchen-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
impressive structures at the Acropolis,"I walked out of the Metro station, looked up, and there it was, a magical place--the top of a hill. I decided to wing it and not look at my map with Greek street names I probably wouldn't have found anyways (as street signs in Athens aren't updated or just not there:-), so I just started walking toward it. I went up these picturesque winding streets and was there within 20 minutes (taking my time). The Parthenon was incredible, although they are always remodeling some part of it. You can't understand the majesty of the Parthenon until you see it with your own eyes. There are other smaller impressive structures at the Acropolis as well. Attention cat lovers: I fell in love with a cat who was sleeping on one of the stone blocks:-) The fee structure was fair. You can choose to do the whole package or just pay to see the Parthenon area. I'll never forget this experience!",March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

perfect (Almost)!,"Almost* everything was perfect! the best hotel room i've been in a long time. I wished this was my own apartment in Athens; then I could live there:-)

*the only caveat was that I asked if they provided shampoo & conditioner, and they emailed back in the affirmative, but alas, they only provide conditioner (and a shower gel). I bought a cheap shampoo nearby for only 1.50 Euros though! I did request an alarm clock, which they provided for me a good one:)

But that is minor, because I'm a neat freak, and all the rooms & everything was clean. They also have a krups-style espresso maker, which was super YUMM!! And not a single strand of hair on site (the marker of good housekeeping, imho:)",March 2019,Andromeda Suites & Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d7732278-Reviews-Andromeda_Suites_Apartments-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
straight from Central Casting?,"I didn't mind waiting 30+ min. in line inside because it was a 95-degree day and they had the A/C and fans blasting. That said, that was the highlight. They had a nice young guy at the counter, but the old guys beyond the counter looked like wise guys straight from central casting.

I came in because they say they are home to the original Muffaletta. Well, was it pre-made or freshly made? They don't show you. Judging from the bread, it sure was dry enough to be from the original sandwich. But I did appreciate the huge portion, which I finished all by myself after all the energy expended from walking the French Quarter during a heat spell. My guess is they use that dry bread is because it won't get soggy when it's pre-made.",June 2018,Central Grocery Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60864-d463919-Reviews-Central_Grocery_Company-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",restaurants,3.0,4.5
did not disappoint - Worth it!,"Cafe Du Monde is one place in New Orleans that met my expectations! I went on a Saturday morning after 6am! It's great that they are open 24/7. Some of the staff are interesting. Even at that early hour, there was still a good size of people there. Hardly a wait though. The chicory coffee was definitely needed at that hour and went great with the beignets. Yes, lots of powdered sugar. My friend had powdered sugar all over her clothes and face. We had a good laugh. That was fun and I love powdered sugar!!",June 2018,Cafe Du Monde,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60864-d1144621-Reviews-Cafe_Du_Monde-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Not ""Legendary""!","I put this restaurant as a ""must-visit"" after my favorite travel website called it ""legendary"" for its Cajun cuisine and live music. I don't know about the live music as I went on a Sunday afternoon, but the food certainly didn't live up to the expectation! I ordered the crawfish etouffee and the portion size was very small. Before I ordered it, I had asked the server if they have a shrimp etouffee as I don't really like crawfish, he just said ""No,"" I asked if they have anything similar to shrimp etouffee, again a monosyllabic ""No"" with no suggestions. You will not find any fine dining here.

Also, the place is big as a warehouse, with lots of tables, and only a few diners were there even though it was Sunday lunchtime. That should have been a red flag.

As I mentioned, the servers (except for one nice gentleman who offered to clear my dish for me) are unrefined. At the end of my meal, my server took my check, looked at how much I tipped him, and then said ""Thank you."" He only thanked me after he checked my tip amount! I said ""You're wecome!""

I also ordered the New Orleans staple drink, The Sazerac. It was presented messy (sticky on the outside of the glass), and it looked like someone had taken a big gulp from it before they served it to me because it was like half-full and sloppy.",June 2018,Mulate's New Orleans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60864-d477708-Reviews-Mulate_s_New_Orleans-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html,"New Orleans, Louisiana",restaurants,2.0,4.0
What a bad start (and ending) to my trip!,"I stayed at Best Western Plus New Orleans Airport for 3 days.

ON DAY 1: rude front desk woman acted like I was the last person she wanted to deal with. She acted like she was doing me a favor (I'm the one who paid $300!). No smile, dressed & made-up unattractively. She told me to sign the hotel agreement. I saw a section for Guest Vehicle info.; I asked her if she needed my car info; she got impatient and demanded that I just need to sign the form. What a bad start to my trip!

Right after that bad experience, another one: There was a 2-car lane in front of reception for people to check-in. I was in 1st lane behind your shuttle van. The owners drove-up to 2nd lane, parked, and went inside hotel. So I was blocked from moving forward and had to back-out of 2-lane area and then drive through the ""wrong-way"" lane to get to the parking area. How rude for the owners to do this to guests! (I know they were the owners because they were chatting with employees on a first name basis.) But how dare they think they can just park and block anyone they want. This isn't India--customers should be #1 priority, and they're not kings!

ON DAY 3: In my 30 years of traveling, I never had the experience of someone having been inside my room. I had my ""Do Not Disturb"" sign out the whole day. I
immediately checked to see if anything was stolen; nothing was taken. It still freaked me out--I thought maybe an employee went inside my room and just messed around. The reason I knew someone was inside my room was because the bathroom light & fan were on, the curtains were drawn open, and a dirty towel was on the desk (I have OCD so I always know exactly how I left things.) This was on June 3rd, Sunday, I was gone from 5:30am-5:30pm, and I was the only guest staying in this room. Feeling violated, I came to the conclusion that the housekeeper must have ignored the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign and started to clean my room but somehow she realized she wasn't supposed to go inside my room, so stopped mid-cleaning and left. This never happened to me ever before--It really scared me at first and made me feel very unsafe!

BOTTOM LINE: I should have kept my reservation at Hilton Garden Inn instead!

P.S. What a sloppy job of cleaning of my room. When I checked in, there was 1) numerous hair on the seat of the leather swivel desk chair, and there was 2) a used stirring straw on the carpet floor.",June 2018,Best Western Plus New Orleans Airport Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g40247-d11717173-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_New_Orleans_Airport_Hotel-Kenner_Louisiana.html,"Kenner, Louisiana",hotels,1.0,4.0
daytime not as spectacular,"I went during the day, which is not as spectacular as I would imagine in the nighttime. The nighttime hides all the smog & pollution. During the day, it kind of reminded me of the Shanghai Skyline during the daytime, and which is also much better at night for the same reason:-/",October 2015,Hong Kong Skyline,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294217-d2482919-Reviews-Hong_Kong_Skyline-Hong_Kong.html,"Hong Kong, China",attractions,3.0,4.5
"confusing fare system and maps,but modern and efficient","I used the MTR subway system for my whole trip. I got the Airport Express Pass for $300HKD of which $50 is refunded if you return the plastic card. Besides the very confusing fare system and maps, the subway system itself is modern and efficient. Luckily I got a nice customer service gal who helped me decide which fare ""package"" was best for my situation.
Caution: I made the mistake of riding on the subway Friday after 5pm when all the students seem to get out of HKU and I was literally smashed inside the subway car.

"smiley staff, but couldn't communicate room problems","I hate to write a bad review because all the staff are so nice & friendly but the main problem was that they can only communicate minimally in English. They only provide shampoo & body wash (supposed to use as soap) in dispensers, and mine broke, but I didn't know how to tell them that my dispenser was broken. A bigger issue was that when taking a shower, the water will automatically turn from cold to scalding hot to cold, and I had to adjust all throughout my shower, which didn't prevent me from almost being scalded! Not very relaxing after a long day in Hong Kong.
On a positive note, their air conditioning was high-tech and you can temperature control it to the exact temp you want:-)",October 2015,Bridal Tea House Hotel (Tai Kok Tsui - Li Tak Street),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294217-d1187163-Reviews-Bridal_Tea_House_Hotel_Tai_Kok_Tsui_Li_Tak_Street-Hong_Kong.html,"Hong Kong, China",hotels,2.0,3.0
