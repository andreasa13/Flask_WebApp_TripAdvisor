Unique Houses,Homes of the from days past. These are beautiful homes built prior to the Civil War and into the late 19th Century. Beautiful to see. The cost a fortune to maintain.

Famous Light House,Once upon a time this light house stood on Morris Island but now it is out to sea. The island has washed away over time. A foundation is trying to keep it standing.

Disappointing,"Service was not very good. It approached terrible. The serviced brought the wrong order for us then wanted to argue about it.

Disappointed,"We visited this restaurant over a year ago and we were disappointed. We understood ownership had changed hands so we decided to try again, I hate to say but the quality of what we had was not very good My wife had spaghetti and meat balls. The sauce was slightly flavored red water. There 3 large meat balls. Saying meat ball is inaccurate. They were bread crumb balls and tasted and looked it. Not very great. I had an Alfredo sauce. Unfortunately it was not very good I was totally disappointed I love a good Alfredo. This not a keeper but a dumper. The did not provide any bread - an Italian place?? In all honesty they were selling a lot of take out pizzas. Their pizzas may be good but I am not willing to try. Go back, no way. Disappointed.",November 2019,Mike's Pizza Italian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54250-d9458093-Reviews-Mike_s_Pizza_Italian_Restaurant-Goose_Creek_South_Carolina.html,"Goose Creek, South Carolina",restaurants,2.0,4.0
