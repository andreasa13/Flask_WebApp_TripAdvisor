We went three times in one week!,"Magic Hands Massage is on the famous pedestrian-only Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue) in Playa del Carmen between Calle 10 and Calle 12 on the east (Caribbean beach) side.

Look for the tiny reception desk on the sidewalk by the “Playa del Carmen Official Store”; the massage spa is upstairs above the store under the palapa (grass) roof.

At the time of our most recent visit in early March, 2020 a two-hour massage was $50 US; of course we added a 20% ($10 US) tip. Our usual Playa del Carmen resort has great beachside massages and also massages indoors in a beautiful world-class spa. The downside is that they are $200 each for two hours.

Magic Hands is decidedly un-fancy: efficient rather than luxurious. The palapa roof admits quite a bit of Quinta Avenida street noise — pedestrian and vendor chatter, piped music from restaurants, an occasional strolling mariachi band, bird calls, etc. — but after a few minutes it becomes background “white noise”.

We were in Playa for seven days on our most recent trip in March, 2020. We indulged ourselves with THREE two-hour Swedish massages by Nory and Natalia on three different days during that time (and went home feeling like eels, oh so relaxed).

Appointments are recommended; you can send a message via the Magic Hands Massage Face Book page at Send Message.

Highly recommended!",March 2020,Magic Hands Massage,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150812-d2352416-Reviews-Magic_Hands_Massage-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",attractions,5.0,4.5
Always outstanding,"We've visited Mahekal Beach Resort eight times in the past ten years; it has always been good and steadily gets better.

We fly out of Denver and touch down in Cancun. With a transfer from the airport in Cancun to Mahekal, we can breakfast at home in the morning and enjoy dinner at Mahekal in the evening.

We've explored the Yucatan over the years, renting cars and staying in various towns and cities, but we keep coming back to Mahekal.

The staff is great at Mahekal; many of them have worked at the resort longer than we have been visiting. We especially like to see out old friends including Ignacio, Jose, Marcos, Angel, Mariano, the irrepressible Rogelio, and our new friends Mario, Zuri, and Viarnay. They make Mahekal a very special place indeed.

The accommodations are wonderful, food is great (we had breakfast, dinner, and drinks at Fuego in addition to meals in the other two resort restaurants), and the structures and grounds are well-maintained.

Mahekal is safe with round-the-clock security at the entrance and on the beach and also patrolling the resort. The only downside we have ever experienced was external: Extremely loud all-night electronic dance music from a festival at the nearby Mamita's Beach Club a couple of years ago. (Mahekal staff was aware of the problem and apologetic but had no control over Mamita's.)

"Good food, great friendly service","The ""White Horse"" café is a tiny hole-in-the-wall place near the Electra Palace Hotel in the Plaka neighborhood, well worth searching out for a friendly, informal lunch or dinner.

A gem!,"The Electra Palace is top flight.

Use your smartphone weather app to determine sunset and get a table at the rooftop restaurant about 45 minutes before sunset: You'll have a world-class view of the Acropolis. The sunset is actually best about 15 minutes before the sun goes down.

The sunset and an excellent dinner will make your day one to remember!

We asked for an Acropolis-view room and while it wasn't as spectacular as the rooftop view we watched a beautiful moonset, dramatic nighttime Acropolis lighting, and beautiful early-morning scenes as the sun rose from behind the hotel.

The staff is first-rate and the facility is clean and well-maintained. The rooftop restaurant buffet breakfast is sumptuous -- an insider tip: you can request custom espresso drinks -- the restaurant's bar is friendly, and service is great.

There is a small rooftop pool and a second small indoor pool on the lower spa level.

The location in the charming Plaka neighborhood is just a 15-minute walk from the Acropolis and there are myriad good non-franchise restaurants nearby. A short walk in the other direction gets one to Syntagma Square where you can grab one of the hop-on hop-off buses for an excellent overview of Athens without having to fight the inevitable big-city traffic.

The TripAdvisor reviews are spot on,"Of course there was a line outside when we got there but people were cordial and the complimentary hot chai was warming.

We stuck with the basics: Vegetable Samosas, Kachumber Salad, Raita, Naan Bread, and bowls of Black Daal. The Daal was so unbelievably that one of the first things I did when we got home was to search for a Dishoom Daal recipe. Unsurprisingly, it is a trade secret.

I found a recipe or two that seem to come close to the Dishoom recipe; the best one will be a ""keeper"" in my recipe file.

"Fun, friendly and informal","While staying at the nearby (and newly-remodeled) Godfrey Hotel for just two days we managed to visit Whiskey Joe's three times, once just for drinks and twice for dinner.

It's a popular place and on weekend afternoons it's mobbed and the parking lot is full. There is overflow parking in the Godfrey Hotel lot but it is $10. Don't worry about a dress code: Heck, it's a beach bar: Think swimsuits and flip-flops.

All of our servers were friendly and professional. One low point was the server who stood near our table and loudly trashed a customer who just left for picking up his credit card but not signing the receipt and leaving a tip. ""It's not worth getting upset over $3,"" another server said to him. Conversations like that should be saved for private time out of the earshot of other customers.

Nevertheless, there are great local beers, good drinks, and respectable food. If we were going back to Tampa we would gladly visit Whiskey Joe's again (and stay at the Godfrey).",June 2018,Whiskey Joe's Bar & Grill - Tampa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34678-d1371111-Reviews-Whiskey_Joe_s_Bar_Grill_Tampa-Tampa_Florida.html,"Tampa, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Great atmosphere, excellent food","We stayed at the nearby and newly-remodeled Godfrey Hotel for a few nights and used TripAdvisor to find a few good restaurants within easy walking distance. The Rusty Pelican came highly recommended and did not disappoint.

Since I generally try to adhere to the Mediterranean Diet with salads and seafoods high in Omega-3's, my wife and I both decided on a salad with grilled Salmon. We placed our orders but were soon told by our server that the chef had rejected the day's Salmon delivery; would we accept a substitution of grilled Grouper for the same price? Why, yes, of course!

The Grouper was perfect and the Seasonal Mixed Greens salads with crinkle-cut pears, grapes, candied walnuts, Bleu cheese, and a subtle vinaigrette were delectable. We washed everything down with San Pellegrino sparking water and a bottle of reasonably-priced Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio white wine.

We were there for dinner relatively early and had a table by the windows with a great view of Pelicans, a very active Osprey, a mother with a procession of baby ducks, and of course the often-mentioned beautiful sunset.

Owen, our server, was gracious and professional without being overbearing. The dining room is beautiful in an upscale way without being pretentious.

The only thing that was a bit off-putting was the fact that there are no sidewalks so pedestrians have to walk in the street. I guess that's a Florida thing because we saw that in other areas as well including outside the main entrance of the Godfrey Hotel. It is not the fault of the businesses, of course, but a definite safety and convenience issue. If you are in a car, have no worries.

If we had another day in Tampa at the Godfrey, we would have revisited the Rusty Pelican.",June 2018,Rusty Pelican - Tampa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34678-d465959-Reviews-Rusty_Pelican_Tampa-Tampa_Florida.html,"Tampa, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Easy-going kayak experience in Tampa Bay,"Since our Tampa hotel, the newly-remodeled Godfrey Hotel, was an easy walk to WhatSUP Paddle Sports, we planned a short kayak trip one afternoon. The afternoon we were there, both of the available solo kayaks were in use so we had a short wait for them to be returned. Apparently, that day there were only two solo kayaks and one two-person kayak available.

We took the kayaks out for two hours -- actually returning them in a little less than 120 minutes -- and found Tampa Bay to be nearly mirror-like with just a slight breeze. The kayaks were nearly new, clean, and in excellent condition.

Some food and drinks are available at the WhatSUP concession at Ben T. Davis Beach and it is only about a ten-minute walk from WhatSUP to the popular Whiskey Joe's Tampa Bar & Grill where we retired for Cuba Libré's after kayaking.

One can book kayaks and standup paddle boards (that's where the 'SUP comes from) online; it might be a good idea to do that in advance so the kayaks are ready when you are. WhatSUP also takes credit cards so the rental transaction is quick and easy.

Where the locals go,"If you are staying at the amazing Hotel Boulderado and want a break from the high energy of Boulder's Pearl Street Mall and its associated restaurants -- don't get me wrong: many are very good indeed -- a ten-minute walk will take you to The Hungry Toad, a low-key locally-owned Boulder institution for some twenty-six years.

The food is ""pub grub"" to be sure but it all all good, fresh, and flavorful. We especially like the chicken tacos when they are available -- there is a different ""taco of the day"" on the weekdays-only Happy Hour menu -- and the Margarita's are great. The Pub Salad is a meal unto itself, the burgers are good and the hand-cut French fries are great.

A popular Brunch is served from 11 am to 2 pm on weekends. The Toad is child-friendly and, of course, being a pub the beer list is awesome. When we've driven to The Toad for dinner we've sometimes parked in the shopping center lot diagonally across from the restaurant and never been ticketed in the evening.

We live in North Boulder and often see our neighbors at The Toad. The stretch of Broadway from Pearl Street north to the Boulder city limits is becoming a bit of a Mecca for quality, non-franchise restaurants and The Toad is a much-appreciated ""anchor"" for this new culinary scene.",May 2017,Hungry Toad,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33324-d381436-Reviews-Hungry_Toad-Boulder_Colorado.html,"Boulder, Colorado",restaurants,4.0,4.0

The food -- mostly seafood and chicken but also some other meats -- and service are always excellent. The wine list is small but carefully chosen.

We make the trip to Longmont from our home in Boulder a couple of times a year; it is worth the thirty-minute drive. Located in a charming vintage ""Old Longmont"" house, Tortugas generally has plenty of parking along Coffman Street -- don't even think about parking in the lot of the auto repair business next door -- and we've seen customers park the U.S. Post Office lot across the street after hours.
