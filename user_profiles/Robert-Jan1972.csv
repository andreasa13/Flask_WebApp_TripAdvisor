Beautiful hotel,"For a short 1 night stay, I stayed in this downtown hotel in Cincinnati. As a frequent traveller I could already check in via the app which made the check in at the desk a breath. The room was spacious, located on the top floor and had a little kitchen and living room. I liked the bedding and the bathroom was large. Overall a very pleasant stay and I will definitely come back in the future.",February 2020,Residence Inn Cincinnati Downtown / The Phelps,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60993-d1889915-Reviews-Residence_Inn_Cincinnati_Downtown_The_Phelps-Cincinnati_Ohio.html,"Cincinnati, Ohio",hotels,5.0,4.5
Solid nothing special,"For a 2 night business meeting in the region I stayed in this friendly priced hotel. The rooms are large, the bathroom is clean and the beds are okay. Breakfast is simple, but offers all you need. The staff is responsive and overall no distractions during my stay. Can be recommended.",January 2020,Germania - Hotel am Schlosspark,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2360435-d1534940-Reviews-Germania_Hotel_am_Schlosspark-Meyenburg_Brandenburg.html,"Meyenburg, Germany",hotels,4.0,4.0
