Amazing views!,"A must! The views are incredible and although the buildings are in different stages of repair, it is great to see the painstaking lengths they are going to restore and keep these monuments for humankind to see. Loved it! Was there in September and was busy but not crazy busy.",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Super Overcrowded!!! NOT SAFE,"This boat would NEVER be allowed to leave the harbour in Canada. The shot I took was while people are still in line to board. There were NOT enough seats for people to sit, and therefore trying to see over the rails in and out were impossible.
I would not have gotten on, but we had already paid. Safety was not their concern and there surely were not enough life jackets for the people on the boat. We did however, enough the sights of the island and the company of the peope we were with.",September 2019,Hydraiki Athens One Day Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2716449-Reviews-Hydraiki_Athens_One_Day_Cruise-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,1.0,3.5
Stress free way to see the city!,"We had a wonderful time with Nunos, who was both informative and funny. He took us up close to many historical sights and wonderful heights which had amazing views of the city. The tuk tuk just allows you to get around quickly through Lisbon, not having to view through a window, and allowing you up close vantage points. Would definitely use this form of transportation in a city again! The lunch of a charcuterie board of cheese, meats, with a glass of wine, was a perfect way to end the tour.
And, if you get a fellow like Nuno, the day is comical and enjoyable! Thanks, Nuno!!",October 2019,Lisbon Historic Center Private Tuk Tuk Tour 3h,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189158-d13282411-Lisbon_Historic_Center_Private_Tuk_Tuk_Tour_3h-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Port.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",activities,5.0,5.0
Great historical monuments and statues!,Very impressive! A peaceful place to walk around and honour the memory of those who passed before us. The statues are amazing works of art.

Authentic Portuguese Food,My husband and I wanted a genuine Portuguese meal in Portugal and at Rosa’s we got it! My husband ordered lamb and the taste was superb.... the best we had in Portugal. Quantities were large too. I had the cod and potatoes and loved my meal also. Fish and potatoes were fresh and flavourful. I would return here ina heartbeat.,October 2019,Rosa do Porto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189180-d13390013-Reviews-Rosa_do_Porto-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html,"Porto, Portugal",restaurants,5.0,4.5
