Famous Ancient Greece!,It was a great way to start our Greek holiday. An introduction to ancient Greece!

Good hotel but pity about the location,"Location location location goes the saying...

Without a doubt a very nice hotel. Staff and their service were top notch. Rooms were nice furnished. Bathrooms were spotlessly clean. Free large bottle of water upon checkin. Breakfast spread was good and with a fantastic view! Equally fantastic views for the evening drinks (same area). Pool? Nah dun bother. Gym? It was ok.

Did you feel safe walking around there at night? Well... maybe... maybe not... Safer in numbers. Loads of graffiti and shops that are closed and boarded up. It was alright going for a morning run at sunrise (7:30am) around the area. But it was just the evening walk back from Plaka and other dining areas that kinda bothered us a bit. Staying here would require you to walk some distance to the various sites or faster by train or taxi. Otherwise a good hotel!",September 2019,Wyndham Grand Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d10961869-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0

Good and different unagi restaurant,"I'm not normally a unagi person, but their eel is definitely different from all the other restaurants. Definitely recommended to anyone who doesn't normally have unagi.

"Friendly service, good food and great coffee!","Went for brunch and the friendly service manager, Marc, served us promptly.

This is actually the second time that I'd been to The Lokal, and once again the food and coffee did not disappoint. Today's brunch: Very good portion of ham and nicely melted cheese in their toastie.

Recommended to anyone for brunch, and lunch. Not sure if they have a dinner menu though.",May 2019,The Lokal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d6771259-Reviews-The_Lokal-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Sounds like good value but....,"Always good to start here on the first day of a visit to Barcelona before you try out all the others. That way you’ll have a comparison between the so-so and the good and the really good.

Great location but bathroom an issue,"Location of this apart’otel is excellent with several attractions like the Gaudi designed Casas, the Palau de la Musica and plenty of shopping all around and lastly a smorgasbord of food & drink surrounding Citadines.

The down side: shower walls were surprisingly dirty and a neurotic hot/cold water shower plus the water seemed to be trickling most times.

Luckily for us the staff were all friendly and helpful. The room itself was very good - space wise, kitchenette facilities were very good, clean (except for shower wall).",November 2018,Citadines Ramblas Barcelona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d206928-Reviews-Citadines_Ramblas_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.0
Nice hotel perched on top of the hills of Sapa town,"Stayed at this hotel as part of a package for the Vietnam Mountain Marathon 2018. It was one of the few hotels sitting on the top of the hilly Sapa town. The whole entire region is hilly. The Sapa town centre, restaurants and shops are all in the Sapa town valley. This hotel is on the top of the hill, and therefore it meant walking down and back up every time you are leaving the hotel. However, the view from the hotel was amazing! The morning air fresh and crisp. Hotel staff were helpful.

Hotel room was spacious especially since I was running in the event which meant that I could spread out my gear etc. Bathroom was also very spacious! Further plus points!

Recommended for its spaciousness and clean rooms & hotel environment as well as the views.",September 2018,Sapa Highland Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g311304-d12324578-Reviews-Sapa_Highland_Resort_Spa-Sapa_Lao_Cai_Province.html,"Sapa, Vietnam",hotels,4.0,4.0
Decent hotel in a great location,"Really decent hotel situated in a great location within the Old Quarter area. Hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful.

Good food with good service,"Many restaurants nowadays offer good food but this place paired it well with great service. Close attention always but never in your face.

Convenient location. Good service with quick food.,"Service was quick and timely. Food came very quickly. Although mains came before the appetiser. Nonetheless, the appetiser was so small that it didn't matter. Perhaps the appetiser ought to be a larger portion!

Hit & miss food. Service lacking.,"We had a birthday lunch celebration on a Sunday and their service was somewhat lacking. Perhaps they had some staff away??

Casual hangout for lunch & dinner,Came here for my birthday recently for a late lunch on a Saturday and it was quiet upstairs in the restaurant. Food was excellent - we had the steak frites (chef willingly changed the fries for a salad) and their burger - with both done very nicely. Drinks were equally good - various drinks on tap and I don't just mean beer. They definitely stay out from the crowd in terms of their drinks.

Attractively priced hotel,"Stayed for 5 nights in this busy shopping belt of Seoul. Sejong is situated at the opposite end of Myeongdong from Lotte Department Store & Hotel. So you're gonna have to lug all your Lotte shopping & duty-free shopping from Lotte back! Although it's very close to the rest of the Myeongdong shopping & dining area.
The concierge is very good & helpful with suggestions and alternatives. Service is prompt and the rooms are clean and in good condition although the hotel does look a little dated.
Sejong and neighboring hotels are one of the last hotel stops along the airport bus loop though so taxi may be a more viable option if you are time-starved and not too budget conscious.",May 2017,Sejong Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294197-d308007-Reviews-Sejong_Hotel-Seoul.html,"Seoul, South Korea",hotels,4.0,4.0

Very good location,"One of the few impressive large hotel that you'll see in the Tenjin area. Size of their deluxe room was large for this standard of hotel in Japan; provision of Shesido shower gels etc was a nice touch. Good service staff from bellhop to room service and front desk.

Of course, in the cool of the evening, you could stroll about 15min over to the Perut Rumah Nyona Restaurant which is just down Jalan Kelawei. Fancy a little bit of shopping? It's just a stone's throw away behind the hotel. Best thing is that you wouldn't be caught in the traffic jam along Gurney Drive ever.
