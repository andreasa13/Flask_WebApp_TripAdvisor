Good Flight,On time and pleasant. We bought the helicopter sunset tour of the Strip on board. It was on promo at $150 for 2 pax. Best deal ever.

"Glitzy, Glitzy, Glitzy!",Someone told me I have to visit Las Vegas at least once in my lifetime. Am glad I took her advice. You have to be there to feel it. Did a helicopter night tour as well. There is so much to do and see. I spent 6 nights there and tried to cover everything. It is just impossible. Hope to go back there again!

Amazing,"You have to know the story behind it to fully appreciate this. On my way to visit the Grand Canyon with Sweetours, I got the chance to watch the documentary. It is historical. The Whys and the Hows. Lives were lost, sacrifices made and people left their families behind to build the Hoover Dam. Floods caused by the ravaging Colorado River were brought under control (did I get it right?).",February 2020,Hoover Dam Bypass,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d1936404-Reviews-Hoover_Dam_Bypass-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",attractions,5.0,4.5

Best Airline,"2018 I flew round trip from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Zurich, Switzerland because I got a good promo deal. I was so impressed that this year I decided to fly to Italy again on SIA. It was a bit pricey (compared with a few other airlines) because I went during peak and also it was a weekend flight. It was worth it! Flight schedule suited me. I flew to Milan first, then went to Florence and Venice by trains. Embarked on a cruise from Venice which ended in Rome. Flew out of Italy from Rome.
Even though I flew economy class, the seats were wide enough and spacious leg room. Service was good. There is an ""in between meals"" snack menu so I was never hungry. Anytime throughout the flight, you can ask for sandwiches, biscuits, nuts, chips, apples or instant noodles.",September 2019,Singapore Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729151-Reviews-Singapore-Airlines,World,flights,5.0,4.5

St Peter's is a beautiful cathedral. Even though I am not a catholic, I was sent to missionary schools by my parents. First to St Mary's and then to St John's for pre-u.
This place brought tears to my eyes, It brought back so much beautiful memories of my school days for me. When St John's celebrated our 100 years anniversary, Pope John Paul II wrote a beautiful message for us in his own hand writing in manuscript.

Furious with Guide from Walks!,"My friend and I checked in at Cafe Piccarozzi on 23 September for this tour. We were told we will be stopping in Sorento instead of Positano. I told guide we have already seen Sorento on 18 September when our cruise ship NCL Pearl docked at Naples. Our shore excursion took us from Naples City along the coast to Sorento and back. Guide assured me this tour will be different. I specifically asked if we will get to see Amalfi Coast. HE SAID YES!. HE LIED TO ME!.
The drive from Naples towards Sorento was identical to the tour I did with NCL. I was hopeful that we will be driving along Amalfi Coast to Pompeii even though we couldn't stop at Positano. I WAS WRONG!. We took the same exact route from Sorento back to Naples and then turn off to Pompeii.
At Pompei, I asked to see the voucher of an American couple, thinking perhaps maybe the mistake was mine. Their voucher shows the same tour ""Small Group Pompeii with Amalfi Coast Drive and Positano Stop from Rome"".
The American told me we did see Amalfi Coast. He said the drive from Naples to Sorento was the Amalfi Coast!. I told him he was wrong. He googled it and finally realised that we DID NOT SEE Amalfi Coast. He confronted the guide. Guide confirmed it. He said the road was closed due to a landslide. It was a long detour and we didn't have enough time to go round the road.
I can understand that BUT he didn't have to lie to me in the first place. As far as the rest of the group is concerned, they saw Amalfi Coast. Which is not right. That was misleading.
We googled and there was a landslide on 14 September. What I also know is there was a NCL excursion to Amalfi Coast on 18 September. Was the road not closed then? Only Walks know the truth! I flew 12 hrs from Malaysia to spend 26 days in Italy and I don't like being lied to. We are not some dumb Asian.
He should have done the decent thing, told me the truth and asked if I would like to change my tour to just visit Pompeii instead of wasting my whole day doing the same thing I did 5 days earlier.
FYI, when our ship docked at Mykonos,our private tour was cancelled due to strong wind. We were immediately offered a full refund and asked if we would like to join another tour instead, which we did.",September 2019,Small Group or Private Pompeii with Amalfi Coast Drive and Positano from Rome,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187791-d11468584-Small_Group_or_Private_Pompeii_with_Amalfi_Coast_Drive_and_Positano_from_Rome-Rome.html,"Rome, Italy",activities,2.0,4.5

Best of Mt Etna,"Our ship docks at Giadini Naxos. Gianfranco was there waiting for my friend Audrey and I. We booked a 4x4 private tour. Gian is a wonderful guide. We stopped at places for amazing views of the mountain. Met the locals there. The nectarines and apricots which we bought was the best and cheapest we ever tried in Italy! It was sold by locals freshly harvest not more than 4 hrs earlier.
Later on Gian took us to a local cafe to sample some local Sicilian food for lunch. Simple food but great and cheap! Local price not tourist price!
We paid Euro400 for the tour and add another 50 to extend our tour to Taormina Town. The drive there was beautiful. Gian took us to some good spots for amazing views.
Thank you for the wonderful experience!",September 2019,Private Mt. Etna 4x4 Tour from Taormina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187886-d17575324-Private_Mt_Etna_4x4_Tour_from_Taormina-Sicily.html,"Sicily, Italy",activities,5.0,5.0
"Good location, value for money","Before I traveled, I email some questions and they responded quickly. That helped as I was traveling solo. Excellent staff from the moment I checked in. Helpful and polite. Lisa helped me booked some day trip.Good choice!! Am glad I took her advice instead of going with another tour operator. I could purchase tour vouchers from hotel itself. I had a problem with all my credit and debit cards and Lisa sorted it out for me.
Breakfast was good value for money and food was great!",May 2018,Sorell Hotel Rutli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188113-d275365-Reviews-Sorell_Hotel_Rutli-Zurich.html,"Zurich, Switzerland",hotels,4.0,4.0
