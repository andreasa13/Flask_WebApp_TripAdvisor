Learn the technique to sit on a camel and you will be fine. Take drinks with you. Don’t buy anything from vendors selling cold drinks inside the pyramid area.

Spectacular Experience!!,"Wow. Wow. Wow. I would give unlimited stars if I could! I booked fast track for an evening view of London, and I was not disappointed. While fast track did cost more, me and my boyfriend were straight past the long line, searched and into a pod within six minutes of arriving. Well worth the extra money in my opinion. But the views? Simply breathtaking. Seriously, the pictures and videos don't do justice. It's so peaceful being that high up, yet you see the city still bustling below. The pod has so many clear windows for excellent photo opportunities and is spacious enough for many people inside without feeling claustrophobic. The pace was just right and not once did I feel uncomfortable. I've seen people saying this is a ""tourist trap"", but I couldn't disagree more. As a Brit myself, I can't recommend you do this attraction enough and hopefully it will shine a light onto why I'm raving about it so much.

Very educational!!!,"When in Manila, Philippines you should come stop to see Fort Santiago. If you like museums and history this is one stop for you. But even if you don’t, it’s one of the historical places you’ll come to see in the Philippines. You can spend a God’s half of the day here. Although, they are still in the process of restoring some spots, you can see that it has been maintained. The architectural structure and characteristics are still visible from back in the day.
Here at Fort Santiago you can take a tour guide, a ride on a horse carriage, have some food, and shop at their cute little stores. The staff are very friendly and the entrance fee is close to nothing when you convert to US Dollars. We really enjoyed our time here. Very educational.
