Amazing,Great park with lots of friendly deer. Maybe don't feed the deer the 150yen crackers. They seem to get more aggressive when being fed and they will run after you.

Great garden,"First, get the combined ticket from Himej castle (it costs 1040 as opposed to 1000 yen just for Himeji, if you get just the ticket for the garden it's 300 yen).

Helsinki landmark,It is impressive to see the cathedral against the impressive backdrop which is the northern sky. It's nice in the evening during sunset to enjoy the light at its best.

Not all stops have ticket machines but you can buy from the driver, however it's the most expensive option.

History,A great incursion in history. The citadel is not that big. There are a few streets to explore and also full of interesting shops and good restaurants. Make sure you bring confortabile shoes as the cobblestone is rough and takes a toll on feet. If by car plenty of parking opportunities in the area.

Amazing fishing village.,"To get here, took bus 21 from Big Budha, runs every hour or so during weekdays and takes 20min. Went back to Tung Chung with bus 11 which runs every 15 and takes about 45min. Fishing village is nice and a trip back in time.

A Beduin experience is a must and so is the SUV day tour to fully enjoy the scenery. Camel ride can be optional if you already rode a camel. Bring sunscreen, protective clothing (sun is strong and amplified by the rocks and sand) and good shoes as many locations require climbing and can be quite demanding for people not very fit so good grip shoes are a must.

Amazing site,"Bring comfy shoes for this one as it is a long trek through history. Can be done in one day if reasonably fit, 2days is best to fully enjoy and do 2 side routes such as the monastery, high place of sacrifice or treasury from above. All of these trails are medium to hard, if done on a hot day bring water and sunscreen. All these trails have 45min - 1h climb. The site is magnificent and is truly a wonder of the world. The Siq and Treasury are amazing, but so are the toyal tombs. I would suggest to visit the palace ruins on the way back from the monastery. Be careful with horse rides, camel rides or any other ride that is not based on your feet, they are not free and not included in the ticket as stated by the beduins. Be careful also with ''guides'' offering to take you to the treasury from above from the treasury, it's expensive and the path is extremely difficult, instead take the official path from the royal tombs (longer).
