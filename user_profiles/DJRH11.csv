Excellent!,"We ate here only once in our week on the island but wished we would’ve returned. Anogi had some of the best food at reasonable prices we had during our stay in Santorini. The service was top notch as well, highly recommended restaurant.",October 2019,Anogi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635864-d2090736-Reviews-Anogi-Imerovigli_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing in Every Way!,"What can I say about Anastasis Apartments that hasn’t been already said by other reviewers? Not much, it’s all been said and all the favorable reviews are spot on accurate.

This establishment has been on my travel bucket list for many years, and my wife and I had the absolute pleasure in experiencing it for ourselves a few weeks ago. I say experiencing it because that is exactly what Anastasis Apartments provides each and every guest, an experience.

For us, it was an incredible experience unlike anything else from any other hotel stay. My wife and I have been blessed with amazing hotel experiences from around the world, but none can compare to our stay here. From the personalized, attentive and friendliest of service from every staff member to the gorgeous facility itself, Anastasis Apartments exceedingly surpassed our expectations and provided us with the stay of our lifetime!

Despina, as I said to you while sadly on our way out your door, you’ve created a heaven on earth. Congratulations to you and the team for touching so many lives including ours. Until we undoubtedly meet again, thank you for the life long memories!

Hugs,

Fantastic,"Worth every penny to visit this historic site. Incredible history here, not to mention to fabulous views of the City of Athens. Visiting in October, it wasn’t overly crowded but still had to maneuver through a good crowd of people. I couldn’t imagine the crowds during the summer months, I wouldn’t want to battle the heat with the crowds climbing those hills and steep steps.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Disappointing Room,"My wife and I stayed a single night while enroute to Santorini celebrating a 25 year anniversary. We were disappointed with our room. To begin, their room descriptions during the booking process online are incredibly vague. We were under the assumption the much more expensive city view deluxe rooms all have balconies, but you know what happens when you assume...

The deluxe room we received on the 3rd floor overlooked a busy intersection, was smaller than expected and dated to the point the faux wood laminate was peeling off the bathroom sink vanity. But worse of all, our room lacked an expected balcony afforded to many other rooms here. The gentleman assured us at check in our room “is a very nice room.” Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. I was too jet lagged tired to initiate a possible room change.

GB Gardens restaurant on the top floor was fabulous. They took special care of us for dinner for our anniversary, many thanks to the crew there. The pool looked beautiful, although we didn’t use it. The concierge was helpful and friendly. The hotel’s location can’t be beat, close to everything worth visiting.

It would be beneficial for Marriott to list the rooms with balconies during the booking process. I have been informed by hotel management here, “our deluxe rooms vary in size, location and features.” Bottom line: you never know what you’re going to get! Just like a box of chocolates.

I was beginning to utilize Marriott for my business and leisure needs, I’ve decided to stick with Hilton. This was my first disappointment with a true 5* hotel accommodation.",October 2019,"Hotel Grande Bretagne, A Luxury Collection Hotel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d198715-Reviews-Hotel_Grande_Bretagne_A_Luxury_Collection_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.5

"Avoid this place, they’re ripping off the tourists!","This place tries to lure you in with free samples and then do their best to upsell nougat that is exhorbitant in price. Be aware that a mere 2 inch thick slice of any of their nougat will cost you about €75 or $85 USD! If you think it’s worth it, go ahead and buy it. But you will find it cheaper elsewhere.

Incredible!!!,"Everything here is nothing short of delicious. We visit often for breakfast and we always end up leaving with a load of pastries. I love the Croquet Madame for breakfast here, and the almond croissants are just about the best things I have ever tasted. And the coffees are equally as good.

Recently voted by NJ.com as New Jersey’s best bakery...yup, they deserve the honor.",April 2018,Sweet Melissa Patisserie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46562-d10387847-Reviews-Sweet_Melissa_Patisserie-Lebanon_New_Jersey.html,"Lebanon, New Jersey",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent Disney choice,"The Hilton Bonnet Creek is an excellent choice over Disney hotels on Disney property. The hotel is extremely clean, hotel staff is always helpful and polite. While the pool is very nice with a lazy river, the hotel staff needs to enforce no saving of chairs. On busy days we estimated 2/3 of all the chairs had towels on them but nobody returned to use them. This made it extremely difficult finding a place to sit. All in all, excellent stay!",July 2017,Hilton Orlando Bonnet Creek,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34515-d1308392-Reviews-Hilton_Orlando_Bonnet_Creek-Orlando_Florida.html,"Orlando, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.5
This amount of legroom should be illegal!,"I will NEVER fly this airline again. While the service was fine, the legroom you are provided is dangerously non-existent. I am appalled how their management could ever feel that cramping people into these seats is a good idea. This amount of legroom(seat pitch) is not only severely uncomfortable but also dangerous to ones health. Until they realize how greedy they've become by ignoring the comfort and safety of the people they serve and start providing a better experience, my family will never fly Iberia Express again.",April 2017,Iberia Express,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d10823588-Reviews-Iberia-Express,World,flights,1.0,3.0

Meh...Commander's is Overrated,"I've dined around the world at renowned restaurants and since I was in New Orleans, I needed to give Commander's Palace a try hearing a great deal about it. We had a party of 12 and the service was definitely excellent. The food was a different story, most of us had cold meals served and definitely nothing to write home about. While I would give the service a thumbs up, the food gets a solid thumbs down. There are MANY OTHER better places to eat in New Orleans. This is a foodie city where the restaurant competition is harsh. I will be skipping the Commander's Palace the next time I'm in town and I advise to look elsewhere.

Fantastic Lunch!,"We had lunch here, and I would definitely recommend Muriel's. The service was excellent, the food was delicious and the ambience was relaxed and comfortable.

Food So Not Good,"3 visits to Cryan's and 3 strikes, they are out. Never again, the food again was terrible for all in our group. Each one of us complained how bad our meal was. A grilled chicken sandwich served on a stale roll, how could they serve this stuff? Also the pizza is no way as good as when this place was Miller's even though they call it Miller's pizza on the menu.
One good thing about this place is the prices won't break the bank.",June 2015,Cryan's Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29746-d5667688-Reviews-Cryan_s_Tavern-Annandale_New_Jersey.html,"Annandale, New Jersey",restaurants,1.0,4.0

Terrible!!!,"I've eaten Conte's pizza a few years ago and loved it. Visited a few days ago with friends and this time it was awful! Everyone in my group said the pizza had NO flavor, the crust was thick and tasteless. We all came to conclusion that it tasted exactly like frozen pizza. I'm not sure where the great recents reviews are coming from, but I suspect these people have not had real good pizza that the NYC area is known for. To top our visit we had a waitress with absolutely no personality and never smiled once, not to sure if she actually thanked us for paying top dollar for terrible pizza.

"NOT the old Carlo's...pastries mass produced, NO longer fresh!!!","SOOOO sad! Buddy expanded and commercialized. This is not your dad's place anymore Buddy! Your expansion took all the quality away. There was a time when the cannoli and lobster tails were filled with cream right on site. Now they are brought in from the Jersey City ""factory"" and they are definitely NOT the same anymore. The pastries leave a bad greasy taste in your mouth, not to mention they are over the top expensive. I've been going here for many years, and definitely have given up on it.

Not the best but very good!,"Grimaldi's has good pizza, not the best, but good still. I've been to the original Brooklyn spot many times as well as this Hoboken site and can say both places are consistently similar. The crust is thin and the sauce is sweet and good.

"Service a bit slow, food well below average","Went here for breakfast based on fairly good reviews and walked out disappointed. I get the fact that locals go here, but that didn't make the food any better. Had a western omelette, bland at best. What irked me was that fact that any type of sides cost extra, even home fries. My wife had pancakes which she said tasted like tire patches and did not finish them.
Food took 30 minutes to come out and drink refills didn't happen even after asking. I feel bad writing this review as the waitresses are very sweet.
There are many other better options in the area.",January 2014,Sneddon's Luncheonette,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46551-d600056-Reviews-Sneddon_s_Luncheonette-Lambertville_New_Jersey.html,"Lambertville, New Jersey",restaurants,2.0,4.0
