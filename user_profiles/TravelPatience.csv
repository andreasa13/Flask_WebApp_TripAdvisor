Great Taxi Transportation in Munich,"I see many asking about Taxi and Uber in Munich. I highly recommend this Taxi service to anyone in need. The taxi ride from the airport to Munich is around 80 Euro. We just arrived from our hotel in Munich to the Airport to fly back home, as I stepped out of the Taxi, I realized I had left our passports and some personal items in the safe of our hotel. I got back in the taxi and asked our driver (Koulentianos Georgios), to take us back to the hotel and then bring us back.... He stopped us, called our hotel, spoke to the Concierge, who in turn brought hotel security and the front desk on the line - among themselves; they put all my possessions into an envelope. Georgios sent one of his taxis to pickup our belongings and bring it to us, saving us time and costs. He also provided us with the taxi's plate number, drivers name and phone number. Additionally, he waited at the airport for us, to ensure we were comfortable with the arrangement. On top of it all, he would not take anything extra for helping us, when we needed someone the most. His only request was that we tell friends and associates to contact him for any transportation requests in Munich. Please contact for your travels in Munich - Koulentianos Geordios Telephone: 017684316003 gkoulentiano@gmail.com ABIGTAXI.COM",September 2019,ABIGTAXI,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187309-d19454594-Reviews-ABIGTAXI-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html,"Munich, Germany",attractions,5.0,5.0
"For $250 per person, you can do much better.....","I have been to this restaurant in the past (in larger groups celebrating milestones), and have been generally satisfied. I have referred people to this restaurant as well. This last time I went, I did not feel right about some of the food that I had been served. I sent a message thru the restaurants website and after not hearing anything back, followed up by filling out a customer survey, requesting contact by someone. I have heard nothing back. I think at $250 per person, you should have complete satisfaction of your meal and if something is even remotely sub-standard, it should be addressed. It was NOT.

Disappointed with visit,"I used to stay here, then I started staying at the Hotel Crystal. While it seems the hotel is implementing some great technology (text communication with concierge services), the execution of this technology is very disappointing. On this recent visit, one of my colleagues had trouble finding the hotel - the concierge and doorman would not help.

You can do better....,"Hotel is well located right beside the English Garden. The daytime front desk staff was helpful. The evening and night time staff was extremely useless and rude. We got in late 10:00PM to the hotel, the gal at the front desk wouldn't even recommend where to find something to eat. We had to google ourselves to find a restaurant near by. We asked her to call us a cab, she insisted the cabs were all located beside the hotel. We walked in the rain around the hotel, because she did not tell us there was a closer door - to find no cabs.... She completely mis-informed us of the menu at the lounge. The service at the lounge was extremely poor, and while they had some premium drinks on their menu, there was not mixologist to prepare them properly. Its unfortunate that they charge the premium Hilton rates while providing poor service product.

Its not just the place....,"We arrived in Santorini with no expectations. My preference has always been hotels and not B&Bs. Our location, five minutes walk from Fira, our room three floors down a beautiful staircase, with a large room overlooking the Aegean Sea (with a small balcony thru the bathroom?). Our host Thomas upon our arrival directed us to immediately go to one of two restaurants to appreciate the sunset, but only with drinks, because dinner should be elsewhere later in the evening. We did just that. Each morning we were served a different gourmet breakfast (Thomas took tremendous pride in his skill as a chef), and told to relax. Thomas each morning would outline our day, by advising where, what, when, how and how much time. We followed his advise to the tee and had the best visit in Santorini that we can imagine. It is like he knew us, and knew exactly what we wanted to do and tailored it accordingly. We received a beautiful room over looking the Aegean, located in a beautiful building. Had personalized gourmet breakfasts each day, with a custom tailored guided tour, and all we had to do was book a room at Le Petit Greek",September 2019,Le Petit Greek Santorini,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d2277624-Reviews-Le_Petit_Greek_Santorini-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0

Great Stay on the Beach,"This place is right on the beach. The staff was overwhelmingly accommodating (including Alex the masseuse who actually helped us with our luggage to the car, the day we checked out). The view from our room was breathtaking. This hotel is 25 Euro cab ride from Mykonos central We made a point of taking the complimentary 9:00PM shuttle (extremely prompt, show up at 9:01PM and the shuttle would be gone!) to town every night for a late dinner and gallivanting, before returning by cab in the wee hours of the morning. They included breakfast and Lunch or Dinner - I found this strange, but why complain - it was included. There were two menus, one that was included and one that was not - there was no upgrade from the included to the paid, it was either / or, this was a bit disappointing. However, we ate in Mykonos each evening, so this served well as a late lunch or an early pre-dinner snack. The restaurant was extremely punctual as well, if breakfast went till 10:00AM - the entire buffet was cleared by 10:02AM! Maria, helped us even when we had questions when we were in town.

More Options Available,"Just checked in for two nights. Quite a disappointing start. First, they charged $20/night for parking and $10/night for ""facility"" fee. Fees that were not disclosed to us during the booking process. So add $30/night to your room rate. Second, we pay the facility fee, but the TV in our room does not work - there is an issue with the antennae. The luggage carts require air in the wheels, so bringing in luggage to room is very difficult, of course no one is available to help. And to add to the above
deficiencies, the air conditioning in the room does not work. Hoping this is the last of the issues.
