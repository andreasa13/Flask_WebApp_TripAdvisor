Historic and beautiful church.,"It was recently the site of my Portuguese cousins' 50th wedding anniversary vows. What a privilege to witness this ceremony in this magnificent place. It is right next to the hospital where hundreds of years ago the Queen would take her thermal baths, hence the name of the town.",August 2018,Igreja Nossa Senhora do Pópulo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g663836-d10379968-Reviews-Igreja_Nossa_Senhora_do_Populo-Caldas_da_Rainha_Leiria_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Caldas da Rainha, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing!,"Go early, bring water and wear shoes with really good traction. The stones are very slippery. It's not for the faint of heart but entirely worth it!",August 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Location,"This hotel exceeded our expectations. The location was even better than it looks on the map - just steps to the boardwalk and beach. You are able to sit outside on a balcony that runs the length of the building and the ""side views"" of the ocean are very nice indeed. The room was clean and comfortable. The pool could use some TLC but was still very nice. I would stay there again.",August 2015,Admiral on Baltimore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34048-d252176-Reviews-Admiral_on_Baltimore-Rehoboth_Beach_Delaware.html,"Rehoboth Beach, Delaware",hotels,4.0,4.5
