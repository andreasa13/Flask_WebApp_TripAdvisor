Defiantly the best outside,"Defiantly the best outside of Asia, I had a fantastic lunch.

It was my first time visiting so the lady that took me to the table told me all about the history and stoped by the window to the kitchen to tell me how the dumplings are made.

She gave me a seat by the window so I could watch the chefs and she made some fantastic recommendations for what to try.

It was so hard to choose that I probably over-ordered but it was all so tasty that I ate everything.

I can’t stop thinking about the salted egg custard bun and the mushroom dumplings!

I really can’t wait to go back to London so I can eat here again!!!!",November 2020,Din Tai Fung UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d15599297-Reviews-Din_Tai_Fung_UK-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Perfection,"If I could only use one word to review this hotel then it would be perfection.

We visited for the first time a few months ago to try their Sunday lunch and was so impressed that we booked two nights in the Master Suite for my birthday.

Our stay was flawless, everything was just right.

The staff are attentive and professional, always there to help and provide a high standard of service. We could not work out how to turn down the radiator and someone came up straight away to assist.

The lounge area is delightful, it’s like being in a stately home. It’s warm and relaxing and we enjoyed spending time by the log burner or by the windows overlooking the gardens with coffee and newspapers.

Our room was luxurious, with a massive four poster bed, smart TV and a jacuzzi bath. The bed was very comfortable, with good quality bedding. The room was clean and fresh and I loved the toiletries that were provided, we ended up buying some hand-wash to take home. It was fun enjoying a jacuzzi bath whilst watching Netflix.

The estate is well kept and we had a very enjoyable walk around the grounds. Even though it’s November it was still a very beautiful place to walk and was kept tidy.

The food is exceptional and the restaurant is my new favourite place to eat in Wales. The dishes are imaginative and luxurious. The pastries and sources were particularly magnificent. The quality of ingredients is very high and it represents good value for what you get. The service is exceptional, very attentive and professional. I want to go back and try their afternoon tea as the baked goods that I had were excellent.

They had a good choice at breakfast and again the food was of a high quality.

We booked to use the pool and outdoor hot tub. You book in 30 minute slots and share the pool with one other couple but have the hot tub to yourself. It’s a good size pool and the temperature is just right (sometimes I find pools to be too cold). I really enjoyed the hot tub, it’s on a balcony outside so you can lay back and watch birds of pray circling above you. They have a steam room and sauna but it’s out of use due to COVID

I also booked a full body massage, which was very relaxing. I liked the fact that you are given a form to notify them of how firm you want the massage and weather you want silence or conversation.

I can’t recommend this hotel, spa and restaurant highly enough, we had a perfect stay and I can’t wait to go back",November 2020,The Lake Country House & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g552061-d290112-Reviews-The_Lake_Country_House_Spa-Llangammarch_Wells_Powys_Wales.html,"Llangammarch Wells, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Magic,"I was not sure if the experience would live up to the hype since it’s a big hit with the Instagram influencers - but it dose live up to its reputation

I was impressed with their COVID safety measures and had my temperature taken on arrival.

I love how they combine modern elements like the Shrigley prints, space egg toilets and their imaginative take on afternoon tea, with classic silver service and live classical music.

The menu is very creative and truly magical. Every dish was truly perfect.",October 2020,Sketch Gallery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2033622-Reviews-Sketch_Gallery-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Best burger,"Stoped off for lunch after a local walk and had one of the best burgers I’ve ever had.

The burger was well seasoned and good quality tasty meat.

The chips were perfect and I loved the sweet gherkins

Lovely visit,"We were staying in a hotel down the road so piped in for a quick visit.

We had an informative and enjoyable tour of the house, which was done well to ensure social distancing

We did not have much time to enjoy the grounds but what we saw looked impressive",November 2020,Picton Castle & Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g552047-d2307094-Reviews-Picton_Castle_Gardens-Haverfordwest_Pembrokeshire_Wales.html,"Haverfordwest, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Stylish stay,"This was a very unique experience which I throughly enjoyed. I stayed in the horse-box, which was very stylish and unusual. The room has been well thought out and it was such a pleasure to be a guest in this room.

I loved the concept of the room, which has kept many original features from the stables. Words can’t describe how stunning the room is so I have taken some photos. The bath is amazing, it must be about three times larger than a normal bath! It was so relaxing and designed to look like a horse trough.They had very nice toiletries and supplied slippers and robes.

Due to COVID there are some changes to how they normally operate so you get a useful disposable information pack on arrival.

Due to the size, the bar is closed so they give you a bar menu and if you want any drinks you just need to call reception and they will deliver to your room (no additional charge for room service). The price of the drinks was very reasonable.

You are also given the choice to have breakfast in your room or in the restaurant. You need to order the night before, which is something I have found quite a few hotels ask for due to COVID. I decided to have the veggie breakfast, I’m not vegetarian but it sounded really good. The veggie breakfast came with fried potatoes and Glamorgan sausage, which was fabulous. My husband had the traditional cooked breakfast and was impressed with the quality of the sausage and bacon and was also impressed with how well the bacon was cooked, as sometimes it can be overdone and hard.

It’s been mentioned in other reviews that that they use packet salt/pepper, however this is due to COVID and many places give packet condiments as this is safer. Also mentioned in other reviews is the fact that they have a marquee, again I would think this is due to COVID as many places have put these up to assist with outdoor dining as there have been times where pubs and restaurants can only operate outside. For me personally, I find it reassuring that they are taking infection control seriously.

We had dinner in the hotel Bistro, which is a nice cosy place to eat. I think it’s probably a reduced menu due to COVID, like many other hotels at the moment. There are classics like burger, fish & chips and fish pie, alongside a daily specials menu. The quality of food was good and we felt the meal to be good value at around £77 for three courses and wine. They had a good selection of wine by the glass. The waitresses were professional and friendly.

The receptionist was very helpful, we arrived a few hours early for check-in so she recommended some local places to visit and had an enjoyable few hours hours Narberth village.

The hotel is set in a fantastic location, the estate is very picturesque. Down the road is a charming castle, which is worth a trip.

Good tray selection in the room with Welsh cakes on arrival and water by the beds.

We had a quite nights sleep and the bed was very comfortable. The room was very clean and airy. It’s a big room so was a little chilly when we arrived in hindsight I should have called reception and asked for a portable heater.

There was a large TV however we struggled to get it to work. The WiFi signal was weak, however as someone that lives in rural Brecon, I understand that this is probably something that is outside the control of the hotel as more rural locations can often struggle to get a reliable service. With such a stunning location it was no hardship for us to be without a TV or internet for the night.",November 2020,Slebech Park Estate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g552047-d735953-Reviews-Slebech_Park_Estate-Haverfordwest_Pembrokeshire_Wales.html,"Haverfordwest, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
Rip off,"Very expensive and not worth it, also lots of additional costs when you get there.

I feel the ticket price is too high and once you get there you have to pay for lots of extras. The car park is an additional £6 and you also have to pay more for the dungeon and archery.

There was not much to see once you were in the grounds -Caerphilly castle is only £8 an adult or £22 for a family and is just as good.

I was disappointed that there was not much information on the history of the Castle.

There were a few things that were included in the ticket price but the lines were long and people were not 2m apart so did not bother.

Quite a bit seems to be closed, which is understandable but it just seemed like an expensive day out.

They also seem to use a lot of tactics to put pressure on parents to spend more money, for example you have to exit by going through the gift shop",September 2020,Warwick Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186400-d195569-Reviews-Warwick_Castle-Warwick_Warwickshire_England.html,"Warwick, United Kingdom",attractions,2.0,4.0
Truly perfect,"We had a truly perfect experience, this is one of the best places I have eaten.

They take COVID precautions seriously and checked when we arrived that we did not have symptoms

The Champaign cocktail was well made and the wine very good

To start we had the Stilton soufflé which was excellently done. It was well thought out and the flavours of each part of the dish was complimentary.

We ordered the beef wellington for our main and it was perfect.

Poor,"Staff were good and the hotel is in a great location but they are the only positives. It really needs someone to check the rooms and put them right

I booked a Privilege Room and quite honestly it was shocking. I hate to think what the standard rooms are like!

I don’t normally give bad reviews but this is a hotel that I would definitely never stay in again. For the first time ever we seriously considered checking out and finding a different hotel.

The room is very tired and the furniture needs replacing. The wood on the top of the desk is chipped and the varnish is peeling off. The chairs were stained and threadbare.

There were stains on the curtains and one curtain had come off the rail.

The walls were also stained and dirty.

The light firing was burnt and wonky

The bathroom needs replacing, there were no covers on the taps. The towels were thin and some were dirty.

You can hear traffic from outside but luckily the road was not too busy.

One of the worst hotel experiences I have had in a long time. I would expect this is I was paying £50 but that’s not what they are charging",September 2020,Mercure Salisbury White Hart Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186414-d192944-Reviews-Mercure_Salisbury_White_Hart_Hotel-Salisbury_Wiltshire_England.html,"Salisbury, United Kingdom",hotels,1.0,4.0
Good stay,"The service was not as good as I would have expected and did not find it as helpful or welcoming as I would have liked.

Called ahead to book a parking space in advance and informed them I would be arriving at 12, I was told that there would be a space booked for me. On arrival the car park was very full and I could not find my reserved space (normally hotels will put a sign with my name on a space). I went to reception and it felt a little confrontational, they said that there were no spaces as guests had not left yet- so I explained that I had called ahead and had been told that I would have a space at 12.00 as I thought that she did not realise I had booked a space in advance- the response was “I can’t do anything if there is no space”. Eventually another member of staff came over and suggested that I park behind another car and give them the keys so that they could move it when a space became available and another member of staff came outside to help find a space. However the response of the first person was not great and really they should not tell you that you will be given a space if they can’t guarantee it - they are better off telling you that it’s first come first served. Normally finding another place to park would not have been an issue but we had timed entry tickets to the castle so we did not have time to be driving around Windsor trying to find a place to park. The parking is £30 which is extortionate and not justifiable

We had another bad experience in the morning when I woke to find a letter pushed through the door asking me to come to reception. I was accused of ordering things to my room without leaving my credit card details. I explained that I had left my details on arrival and on checking they realised that they had made a mistake. They told me that someone had ordered to their room without leaving details and they thought it was me. They should have checked before accusing me and asking me to visit reception, they had a file with all the credit card receipts so it was not hard to check before accusing me (and probably would have took less time than typing and sending up the letter) and I was left wondering why they had profiled me as being the person charging things to the room! It’s not nice to feel that people think you are trying to steel.

I felt the bar needed more attention with regards to COVID. For example tables were not being cleaned between customers and twice my table was dirty. Also they are providing paper menus that are shared.

Ordered room service, had a sandwich and cocktail. The sandwich was average, not worth the price and the cover charge for room service was high. I only ended up ordering room service as I did not feel confident in the cleanliness of the bar.

I had a suite and although large with separate lounge, it lacked some attention to detail. There was a rip in the side of the bedding and one of the pillows smelt. The bath is looking a bit tired.

Some of the advertised amenities had been removed due to COVID and I was not sure how to order them.

Location was good.",September 2020,Castle Hotel Windsor MGallery Collection,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186419-d192494-Reviews-Castle_Hotel_Windsor_MGallery_Collection-Windsor_Windsor_and_Maidenhead_Berkshire_Engla.html,"Windsor, United Kingdom",hotels,3.0,4.0
Amazing,"We had an amazing time at the hotel, staff were very helpful and friendly. There was no room in the hotel car park so needed to park in the public car park (very close to the hotel and secure) and they offered to park our car up when a space became available

You can arrive at noon before check in an pick up free passes to visit the castle and grounds. On check out at 10.30 you can visit the castle before it opens to the public.

We had a feature room in the Ann Boleyn wing and it was amazing. Spacious and well designed rooms with all the things you need. All the small things that hotels can often miss have been thought about, such as plugs next to the bed and mirror and good natural light.

The bathroom was fantastic, with a roll top bath and massive shower. Luxury toiletries and towels are provided.

The bed was massive with great pillows and bedding.

Due to COVID breakfast is pre-order. There is a good selection of choices and the quality is brilliant.

They have really put a lot of effort into ensuring the hotel is COVID safe and I was really impressed. They put a seal on the room so that after it’s cleaned no one but you enters the room and they put plastic screens between the tables in the dining room.

My new favourite local,"Although close by I have not visited before

We got a free soup that they made with our local veg box delivery (delicious) and after taking a look at this place on their website we found that they do take away pizza & curry on Thursdays and take away Sunday lunch on a Sunday

It’s a great system - you order a few days before and pay by phone and then drive up at the allotted time and they will come out and put the food on a table for you to collect. This way we can pick up food and keep to the social distancing rules

Last Thursday we ordered pizzas (it was so good not having to cook)

The pizzas were some of the best I have ever had. The base and sauce was perfect and the toppings were plentiful and very good quality

we purchased the basic package as we did not have a towel or the mandatory cap and flip flops. this was not good value for money as the quality of the towel and bathrobe was very poor - it was like a j-cloth! I expected better for a £45 ticket.

Fantastic,"Had a fantastic time, it’s the first time I’ve eaten Ethiopian food and the food and experience here was amazing

Had the mixed veg and meat on Injera. The mix was great and there was such a fantastic range of flavours, it was not too hot which is good for me as I don’t like a lot of heat. I’ve never had Injera, it’s lovely.

I had a glass of the honey wine, it’s sweet like a nice desert wine.

I also had the coffee ceremony, which was really interesting. The coffee was very tasty

Really good value for money",December 2019,Adulis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d730164-Reviews-Adulis-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Fantastic stay,"Really good hotel, very stylish and comfy.

The size of the bedroom and bathroom is large. The room is well equipped - slippers, robe, mini-bar, iron, expresso machine, ect.

Good lighting and plenty of plug sockets. The hairdryer was good and they have a lighted mirror for doing make-up. The shower is powerful.

Very good location, directly in front of the metro and only a few stops to all the main sights, also easy to get to from the airport.

I did not feel unsafe in the area, there are lots of hotels

There is a good cafe selling pastry and cake over the road so there’s lots of options if you do not want to pay for breakfast in the hotel

Staff were friendly and helpful

The view from the rooftop bar is amazing, they also have good selection of drinks and cocktails",December 2019,Wyndham Grand Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d10961869-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Very good collection,"Very good collection but the curating is a little old fashioned, which meant that I felt a little overwhelmed by all the items and could not see the wood for the trees.

I’m not sure that it’s very children friendly.",December 2019,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nothing exceptional,"Nothing exceptional about the yogurt I’ve had better. The toppings were too sweet for me.

It was ok but it not worth hunting down to find, I should think most places in Athens will serve yogurt like this. Did not stand out",December 2019,Fresko Yogurt Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2148019-Reviews-Fresko_Yogurt_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
A real feast,"I came here because of all the good reviews on TA. To be honest I was a little apprehensive when I arrived as it was in a tourist spot and there was someone outside encouraging people to look at the menu - which I always associate with being a tourist trap.

I was very wrong about my first impressions - this place really deserves all it great reviews !

Our waiter was fantastic - friendly, attentive and helpful. He was great and really made us feel welcome

I just don’t know what to say about the food!!!!

We had the Tzatziki, smoked aubergine and split pea dip to start - so fantastic

For our main we had the Greek platter for 2 - and WOW it’s amazing. It included the best musaka I’ve ever had, roasted lamb with vegetables, strips of chicken, feta baked with tomato and vegetables stuffed with orzo

Every dish was superb

We had so much fun trying all the dishes, it was a great night",December 2019,Liondi Traditional Greek Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d5041914-Reviews-Liondi_Traditional_Greek_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wow,"I have been wanting to go for years. This place was magical. December seems to be a good time to go as it’s not too hot.

Although the weather is not hot I would recommend taking some water",December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Staff were really helpful and gave great suggestions for fishes to try.

Portion sizes are very generous

Good quality is excellent and so tasty.

Fantastic airport hotel,"Really good location directly across the airport and next to the long stay car park.

Really quite and comfy rooms you would not know you were so close to an airport

Breakfast starts at 4 so really good for early flights",December 2019,Hampton by Hilton Bristol Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186220-d11642149-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_Bristol_Airport-Bristol_England.html,"Bristol, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.0
Good honest pub food,"First time I have been since a bad experience 18 months ago (to be fair the manager did reach out to us after my poor review and offer us another meal)

I had the weekday lunch menu and was impressed with the value for money. Good selection of traditional pub classics and large portions.

Staff were attentive

Very clean and nice traditional pub feel

Wine was good quality.

It’s absolutely what you want in pub food",November 2019,Abercrave Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1041931-d1785128-Reviews-Abercrave_Inn-Abercraf_Powys_Wales.html,"Abercraf, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Best mid range hotel in London,"We will alway use this hotel when in London.

It’s everything you could want from a midrange price hotel.

Location is excellent - just over the road from a central line tube station.

Decor is trendy, fresh and modern.

The quality is exceptional. Fantastic beds and pillows. The towels were really fluffy and big and they had high quality toiletries.

Extremely good shower and lighted mirror which was good for makeup

The rooms were stylish and practical - little things like having plugs next to a mirror is really important but a lot of hotels don’t have this

I think it is the cleanest hotel I have ever visited. The bathroom was pristine with no mould.

The staff were friendly

We did not have breakfast but will get it next time. There was a good choice and it looked good quality",November 2019,The East London Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d14912172-Reviews-The_East_London_Hotel-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
