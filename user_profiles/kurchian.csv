Views and more views,We weren’t up for the entire length of the trip so we only did the 1 mile portion to Imerovigli. This well trodden stone path is on the caldera edge so you have views forward towards Oia and back to Fira almost the entire way.

Lodging at its finest,"When we arrived for our 3 day visit the owner met us at the door and insisted on carrying our bags up the stairs. I was embarrassed as she was over 60, but before I could object up went the bags.
This was but a portend for the incredible hospitality she provided through our stay. Our room was on the top floor with a very large totally private outdoor balcony with a view up to the castle. Room was spotless. Breakfast was made to order. The owner makes fresh spanakopita daily. The location is perfect, in old town but a bit away from the hustle.
I’ve travelled widely but this may be the most pleasant proprietor and inn I’ve ever stayed at. Couldn’t recommend it more highly.",October 2019,Aetoma Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g319780-d626052-Reviews-Aetoma_Hotel-Nafplio_Argolis_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Nafplio, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Best quick bite,If you’re looking for an under 5 Euro quick bite this is the place to go. It is a hole in the wall with about 5 stools.

Must see,Even if you’re not a Greek history buff this is a must see. We bought a small group tour from Athens Walking Tours which was worthwhile.

Highlight of our Havana trip!,"We booked this tour for 6 of us three months before we arrived based on reviews we read on Trip Advisor.
All our emails were promptly answered and the operator told us we didn't have to pay until the tour was over. We booked a Havana Highlights tour for 6 hours. The private tour cost was 240CUC for the 6 of us. If you didn't want a private tour the cost would be less. Finding the guide was easy as the meeting spot was ten minute walk from the ship terminal.
Our English speaking guide, Xuri, was tremendous! I would highly recommend her. She was university educated and very personable and spoke great English. From 10AM to 12:30 we walked around old Havana and she answered all our questions. We then loaded into a comfortable van (that seated the 6 of us, our guide and the driver.) They brought us to a very nice restaurant for lunch. The lunch was great with Cuban delicacies, but the patrons were either rich Cubans or other tourists.
After lunch we were driven around the area to see places we couldn't walk to. The tour ended about 4PM.

A highlight of our Havana trip,"Let's remember that the US sponsored an invasion of Cuba in the early 1960's. It's called the Bay of Pigs. The invasion was poorly planned and failed.
So this museum is the Cuban government's celebration of Castro's rise to power. It is full of military equipment and portray's Castro and Che Guevara as full fledged Cuban heroes.

Fascinating area,We were on a cruise that docked in Cienfuegos. We walked from the ship to this square. Many of the buildings have a Spanish Colonial feel to them and are attractive to see.

Great alternative to the beach,"We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to these ruins. If you go don't just walk around - hire a guide. Our guide cost about $10 total for the 4 of us. He was well educated, spoke flawless English and was charming and full of historical info about the ruins and the Mayan people.

"Beautiful inn, but one important caveat","I stayed at the Hampton Terrace recently. The inn is beautiful. The grounds, the buildings, the cleanliness, the furnishings, the breakfast and the pool are all first rate. However, if I were to stay again I would never stay in the carriage house. When an upstairs guest showers or merely turns on the water the sounds are near-deafening. To compare these sounds to a jet engine taking off is admittedly an exaggeration, but not by much. To spend $300+/night and endure these noises unfortunately reduces my rating.",July 2017,Hampton Terrace Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g41639-d77776-Reviews-Hampton_Terrace_Inn-Lenox_Massachusetts.html,"Lenox, Massachusetts",hotels,3.0,5.0

Must do,We stopped here and parked because it is from this location where you hop on the bus to go up to Eagle's Nest. We hadn't been planning to visit the Documentation Center.

Not spectacular but an easy short walk with views,This is about a mile in length with minor elevation gain. There are nicely situated benches for rests and views. You might need this if you are staying at the Kviknes and enjoying the Smorgasbord!,September 2016,Nature Trail Kreklingen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616211-d3475275-Reviews-Nature_Trail_Kreklingen-Balestrand_Sogn_og_Fjordane_Western_Norway.html,"Balestrand, Norway",attractions,4.0,4.5
Guided Taxi Tour of Flam/Gudvangen Area,"We wanted to avoid a crowded bus tour and get some expert local commentary so we took a chance on this taxi service. For a fixed price they will bring you to the local attractions. We were picked up at the Fretheim in Flam and our driver drove the snow road to the Stegastein Lookout and then to the Borgund Stave Church. Our driver, Roger, was tremendous. He is a local so he provides a fascinating running commentary as the trip unfolds. He is personable, speaks good English and drives safely on the twit roads. Had we driven or taken a bus we never would have learned all the interesting fats that Roger provided.",September 2016,Gudvangen Taxi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g230076-d10847368-Reviews-Gudvangen_Taxi-Flam_Aurland_Municipality_Sogn_og_Fjordane_Western_Norway.html,"Flam, Norway",attractions,5.0,4.0
A Highlight of our Norway Trip,"We are seniors and were a little reluctant to go kayaking as we weren't experienced and the thought was a little scary. But our concerns were quickly laid to rest when we arrived. Our guide, Antonio, was tremendous. He was patient and didn't mind our slow approach to the outing. He took the time to carefully go ver the entire process with us. When we finally got out in the water we had a tremendous time. We had a two man kayak and the front seat passenger doesn't even need to do anything if they so choose. The person in back does the steering. We took the short two hour tour and made it as far as the Seven Sisters waterfall. The pictures we got were great. Antonio even took our camera and took pictures and videos of us. Highly recommended.",September 2016,Geiranger Fjordservice AS,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g642196-d3524612-Reviews-Geiranger_Fjordservice_AS-Geiranger_Stranda_More_og_Romsdal_Western_Norway.html,"Geiranger, Norway",attractions,5.0,4.5
Worth the trip,We also visited the Briksdalbreen glacier but this one is better. You can get much closer and this one is less visited. Along the way there is a fascinating historic marker to a tragic landslide that claimed many lives. New sure to stop and read the information there. The beauty of this glacier is the drive along Lovatnet Lake.,September 2016,Kjenndalsbreen Glacier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315898-d7218582-Reviews-Kjenndalsbreen_Glacier-Loen_Stryn_Municipality_Sogn_og_Fjordane_Western_Norway.html,"Loen, Norway",attractions,4.0,4.5
A bit disappointing,We visited this glacier and the nearby Kjenndalsbreen Glacier. We much preferred the latter. This glacier is much farther away from the parking lot. In fact you either need to walk a mile or so or pay for a train to bring you there. Also this one is loaded with tour buses. Best part of this for me was the drive past Lovatnet Lake.,September 2016,Briksdal Glacier (Briksdalbreen),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g939035-d1955552-Reviews-Briksdal_Glacier_Briksdalbreen-Stryn_Stryn_Municipality_Sogn_og_Fjordane_Western_.html,"Stryn, Norway",attractions,3.0,4.5
Lotsa places to eat!,"We stayed right on the River Walk at the Hyatt so we could literally walk the walk by stepping out of our hotel. The walk is interesting from a culinary point of view as there are countless places to eat and drink. Some fine dining and some fast food is available for all tastes. It is great for people watching. Little boats constantly traverse the river of those so inclined. Frankly, for me after one roundtrip of the downtown section I was done with it.",March 2016,San Antonio River Walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60956-d105056-Reviews-San_Antonio_River_Walk-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",attractions,4.0,4.5
It's in your history books so you gotta see it,"We could actually see it from our hotel room so it was interesting to see it around the clock. We had walked the Mission Walk farther south and frankly, this was the least interesting of the missions we saw. Other than the important history of what transpired at the Alamo it isn't much to see.",March 2016,The Alamo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60956-d103610-Reviews-The_Alamo-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",attractions,3.0,4.5
Great for a walk or bike trip!,"The San Antonio Missions National Historical Park is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Even if you don't care too much about the history it is a perfect way to spend a few hours walking or bicycling between the missions. There is a wide paved walk between the missions on both sides of the river. There are also bike rentals at each mission. We drove to the Visitor Center at Mission San José, parked our car and walked south along the river. By the time we reached Mission San Juan we were ready to bicycle so we rented bikes from the self service bike stands that dot the parkway. They're even listed on the Park Service maps.",March 2016,Mission Trail,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60956-d108457-Reviews-Mission_Trail-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",attractions,4.0,4.5
Worth a visit,"I'm a lover of Presidential libraries and this one didn't disappoint. You can't help but get a different impression of LBJ after visiting.

Given the legislation he signed while President (Medicare, Medicaid, HeadStart, Vista, funding to establish PBS & NPR) he would be considered a Socialist today. (And let's not forget the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.) His Presidency might be the peak of modern liberalism in our lifetimes.

Of course, there was Vietnam. The war was dealt with frankly and effectively. As a college student during that period I had learned to dislike LBJ due to the war. I still can't forgive him but after the visit I have softened my tone as I realize that he was as much a victim of history as he was a initiator of the conflict.",March 2016,LBJ Presidential Library,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30196-d145840-Reviews-LBJ_Presidential_Library-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",attractions,4.0,4.5
