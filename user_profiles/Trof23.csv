Underrated,"Don’t know if something changed in time but the reviews seem harsh for what experience we had. Food was great and plenty, service was fast and accurate with very affordable prices. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because of the single bathrooms, can get rather packed. Great place to eat overall.",February 2020,Restaurant Ursul Carpatin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295394-d10619727-Reviews-Restaurant_Ursul_Carpatin-Brasov_Brasov_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Brasov, Romania",restaurants,4.0,3.0

WoW!,"Spectacular view, very good service and oh my god, the tea! Savor a cup of coffee of tea while taking in the view and you’ve got a once in a lifetime experience!

Read for tip at the end,"PROs
Spectacular construction, you’ll be taking pictures every minute;
Luxurious interior, including the carpet that broke the World Record;
Unique and well crafted souvenirs;
A very friendly and knowledgeable guide, we found out a lot of interesting facts from him;
Inside staff very polite and helpful, I was really impressed when someone stopped a small go cart to give us a lift to the end of the long corridor;
Water fountains spread everywhere, you always stay hydrated;
Bathrooms are HUGE and have everything, even spots to cool your feet;
Breathtaking at night!

CONs
Security outside are blunt instruments, expect very sharp and rude answers (might not be their fault, the Mosque conduct might be set that way to ensure safety);
Small isles, we went in September when few people were there but I imagine it gets really crowded;
Women are forced to wear the mosque attire (can’t mess with tradition);
Souvenirs were a bit on the expensive side, but I guess that can be expected.

TIP: Once you pass the security checks and through the corridor, when you arrive at the main entrance, where the arch overlooking the court is look to your right. There will be a panel showing you when the next FREE tour is. Not only will you learn a lot of facts but you can visit areas that are Off limits normally. The guide we had was knowledgeable and had a fun way of relating information and would not accept any other form of appreciation other than our satisfaction. Totally worth the approx. 45 minutes while you are there!",September 2019,Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294013-d1492221-Reviews-Sheikh_Zayed_Grand_Mosque_Center-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Out of this world lobby, amazing view, perfect location but ""vintage"" rooms","Hotel is near the metro station and a supermarket, we couldn't have asked for more.

We really enjoyed our stay and it really made it easy for us to see the city fast and convenient.",September 2019,Novotel Dubai Al Barsha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d3528995-Reviews-Novotel_Dubai_Al_Barsha-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Excellent services overall, 10/10 if the WiFi was better","Staff was very polite and helpful, we got all the help we needed and beyond starting from the concierge and ending with the two nice lifeguards Min Bhahadur and Ganesh, Min especially was very good spirited and engaging, always making sure that everyone was having a good time! The spa is amazing, they even have a Hammam pool and massage facilities. Top quality EXCEPT the WiFi... WiFi reception was terrible. Other than that would definitely come back!",September 2019,Le Meridien Abu Dhabi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294013-d301546-Reviews-Le_Meridien_Abu_Dhabi-Abu_Dhabi_Emirate_of_Abu_Dhabi.html,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,4.0
"If you miss this, you're missing one big chunk of Prague History","Comprehensive tour, one of a kind feeling inside the bunker and you get one of the best souvenirs to take home from down there!
