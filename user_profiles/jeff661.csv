We will always remember you...the best!,"Months before our trip to Sofía,Bulgaria we learned about Este Spa through the Intercontinental Sofía hotel to whom we are deeply grateful for this amazing recommendation.
Since we were not sure if we were going to be arriving in Sofía at the time scheduled by our air line, the Este Spa reception showed flexibility and told us to call them when we arrived to the hotel and so we did.
They took us one hour earlier than we thought and the most relaxing and pleasurable journey started.
We booked a Este Royal treatment that includes an absolutely amazing Hammam ritual and the most delicious and relaxing 4 hands massaging in sync and harmony.
We became one.
We were just in heaven!!!
