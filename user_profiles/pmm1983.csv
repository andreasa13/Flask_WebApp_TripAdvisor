Amazing rock but bit overcrowded,"It is really amazing rock formation, definitely must-see if you are in the area.

Beautiful spot,"Nice hidden spot in the WA South West. You can get there walking (Cape to Cape trail) or driving (4WD only). Definitely worth checking out. Waterfall by itself is not too high but looks very interesting, some kind of small jungle-type oasis among dunes.",February 2019,Quinninup Falls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g4604613-d16858008-Reviews-Quinninup_Falls-Wilyabrup_Margaret_River_Region_Western_Australia.html,"Wilyabrup, Australia",attractions,5.0,3.5

Driver service,"We used this company to provide us with whole-day driver+car service (2 days in a row). Our driver Eka was very professional, always on time and always happy to help.

"Amazing waterfalls, but don’t get ripped off","Both waterfalls (Sekumpul and Fiji) are amazing, beautfiul location, true gems in Bali. But... on our way we passed at least 4-5 „Registration Point” which basically want to take the money for „access to waterfall” - just pass them, don’t talk to them. At the car park another guys want to rip you off, saying that you need to hire a guide as the road is dangerous and complicated (which cost around $30k per person) - bulls**it, just walk down the trail for about 1 km and you will see real ticket booth ($2k per person). Trail is not hard you can do both waterfalls within 2 hours (took as slight longer as we had a lunch at Sekumpul Restaurant) - you don’t need any guide!!! And there is no obligation to hire any (even if they tell you something else). I don’t mind paying people for the services they offer, but cannot stand lies and ripoffs.
Trail as itself is beautiful, fantastic experience. Waterfalls are majestic (especially if you come relatively early, before midday as you can avoid crowd). Amazing jungle location",June 2018,Sekumpul Waterfalls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297699-d3218339-Reviews-Sekumpul_Waterfalls-Singaraja_Buleleng_District_Buleleng_Regency_Bali.html,"Singaraja, Indonesia",attractions,5.0,4.5

"Great place, great service, location is the problem","This is amazing place, clean and nice stay with awesome staff. The only problem is location, far from Ubud and considering there are not too many pavements around it is really hard to get there (unless you will gat a „rip off taxi” - they quoted us 200k IDR for a 3km trip from Ubud to Ila Villa...)",June 2018,ILA Kitchen & Villa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297701-d12521446-Reviews-ILA_Kitchen_Villa-Ubud_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html,"Ubud, Indonesia",hotels,4.0,4.0
Nice and relaxing walk,"Nice and relaxing walk, great views at the beginning of the trail, once you get to all the shops/cafes/restaurants it loses its mood.

Nice spot,Red Bluff is nice spot with some amazing views. Lots of people though so it is busy and noisy usual (been there 3 times and each time there were plenty of people over there).

Great campsite,"Great campsite with plenty if space. clean amenities and cosy beach just around the corner.

Nice walk but expensive too,"Bit too expensive for what you get. Not worth $21 (just for 600m of walk). Ancient Tree walk in the bottom of the forrest offers more for free

Amazing Park,"Great park to a few-days visit, not as crowdy as Cape Le Grand (around 200km East) what is massive advantage.

Amazing looking beach but too busy and too windy,Turquoise Bay looks amazing but there are definitely too many people usually so if you don't like busy places that's not great destination.

Great rock but nothing else around,"it is an amazing shaped rock but in my opinion it's not worth driving 4 hours one way (there is almost nothing else around, short walk on Wave Rock and Mulka Cave 20km from there).
