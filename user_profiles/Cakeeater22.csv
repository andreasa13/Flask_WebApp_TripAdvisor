PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR BILL!,"The ""calculations"" for the tip on their ipads is inflated. The percents and the dollar amounts were inflated! So shady! When it says 15%, it was actually a 20% dollar amount listed, and same for the others listed. So if you tapped on 15% tip, you were actually tipping 20%, and if you selected 20% tip you were actually tipping 25%.

They also had enough awareness of the allergy to notify my that fries go in the same fryer, so they could leave those off if need be, which is what i chose to have them do.

"Charming, relaxing and wonderful hospitality","We loved it here and wanted to stay forever :) We had a charming room that was spacious and an enjoyable atmosphere, including a fireplace (didnt use that much since it was June, but still). Everything was really clean and tidy, and their bath products provided smelled amazing.
Breakfast was incredible! They have a lovely garden to sit outside in, or an indoor area surrounded by windows and classical music. They were extremely accommodating about my gluten allergy, and I could participate in all meals. The first day was a hearty omelette, and the second day was blueberry french toast, all GF. We even scheduled the cream tea one afternoon and they set out a bunch of gluten free pastries for me. They also baked gluten free cookies and labeled them separately for me each night (since they provide cookies every evening for guests). Felt so personal and known.
This is a beautiful property with many areas to sit outside and relax. It is a very short drive from town, and you could easily do the 10-15 min walk instead. The staff was so friendly and welcoming, we would love to go back, and will definitely be recommending this place to anyone going to Cape Cod!",June 2020,Captain's House Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g41499-d114159-Reviews-Captain_s_House_Inn-Chatham_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html,"Chatham, Massachusetts",hotels,5.0,5.0

just okay,"They were definitely busy, and when they seated a more elderly couple ahead of us, they brought over complimentary glasses of wine to us for having to wait a few extra minutes, but i thought that was very kind of them to not leave the older couple just standing and waiting. The menu was unnecessarily long. Because of that, the waiter was not very helpful with gluten free options. Basically is was ""salads...the grill section...or maybe these 1 or 2 other things""...i dont expect the waiter to memorize such a long menu, but its a bummer that he couldnt be more specific. they also charged us for a side of rice when the waiter had discussed it like it came with the meal, ""and is rice okay?"" we were really ready to leave by the time the meal ended, the food was fine, but the whole experience really rubbed us the wrong way.",September 2019,Naoussa Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d1067977-Reviews-Naoussa_Restaurant-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Enjoyed fresh lemonade while they checked us in, and received a complimentary bottle of wine in our room too. the bed was so comfortable and it was nice and quiet in the room for sleeping, and on the patio when we hung outside. it is tucked away nicely so people arent; walking in front of you at your room or the pool. The food options they have at the pool (the room service basically) were super yummy!! the staff also helped make reservations for us at restaurants, and you felt very known and doted on the whole time. Close walking distance to many restaurants, but the only time we left was for dinner. they give you a robe and slippers to use, and have evening turn down service too.

good food but understaffed,"good food and a really nice server, but so far beyond understaffed. We never received our wine, which was fine, but it took us almost an hour to leave. Many other tables were trying to do the same, but instead of bringing the check or helping tables clear out, they just kept trying to bring more shots of the greek alcohol. which was a nice gesture, but when you want to leave, a shot of what tasted like straight liquor was not the solution. we had to ask for the check twice and then it ended up being the wrong one. the food was good and the waiter said to come back and he would comp our wine, but we didnt want to get stuck there for hours again so we didnt end up returning",September 2019,Taverna Romantica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g635607-d4358400-Reviews-Taverna_Romantica-Firostefani_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5

overall good,"The room was really small, which is common for european hotels. The biggest problem with this place was the fan in our room. There was an AC/heat unit that would go on and off through the night and everytime it would stop or start, the blades on the unit would fan open and make this reaally annoying creaking noise. We needed the unit on because the room was too hot otherwise, but it drove us crazy all night. It could have just been our room, we didn't ask to switch, but i had to sleep with headphones on every night because it was so annoying. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was nice. There is a code for the door to come in to the building, so just make sure you remember the code. The first night we were there, we almost forgot to write it down, and i have no idea what you would do if you got back after hours and didn't remember the code. it was about a 15-20 min walk to the city, and less if you just went to some neighborhood restaurants/pubs, but the walk wasn't bad and was well lit.

It was easy to come and go and only had a few rooms. It was about a 5 min drive to town which was easy and nice. Walking would have been fine too. the bathroom was new and nice, and room was so spacious and comfortable! It was really quiet and the bed was really comfy! Our room had a door that opened to the outside, and overlook the pastures and ocean. it was one of my favorite memories to sit by the open door and listen to the rain and look out at the beautiful view and hear the sheep bleating! Breakfast was fine, but be careful if you have a gluten allergy. I said at breakfast that i had a gluten allergy, and then i ordered the salmon and scrambled eggs, but it was brought out on top of a piece of toast. So just be hyper specific and clear that no bread can come in contact with your food. Overall, we loved this place and would recommend it and definitely go back! Was our favorite B&B we stayed at the two weeks we were in Ireland.",September 2018,Sea Shore Farm Guesthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g211860-d213140-Reviews-Sea_Shore_Farm_Guesthouse-Kenmare_County_Kerry.html,"Kenmare, Ireland",hotels,5.0,5.0
friendly and cozy,"We really enjoyed staying here! we met one of the owners, helen, and she was so kind and helpful! gave us a map and listed good restaurants, places for music, how to get there by walking etc. It was easy to come and go. It was about a 15-20 min walk to town, but parking in town is free after 6pm, so we just drove which was easy and nice. Walking would have been fine too. the bathroom and room were nice! They also have a nice lounge common room with large windows, comfy chairs, and an espresso machine. Breakfast was fine, but be careful if you have a gluten allergy. They have gluten free bread, but i think both days we were there they accidentally forgot by the time the meal came out and brought the regular bread. So just be sure to double check. Overall, we loved this place and would recommend it and definitely go back!",September 2018,Tower View Bed and Breakfast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g211861-d295284-Reviews-Tower_View_Bed_and_Breakfast-Dingle_Dingle_Peninsula_County_Kerry.html,"Dingle, Ireland",hotels,5.0,5.0
Overall great,"My favorite thing about staying here is that you can book your skellig michael landing tour through the hotel and they make it easy to coordinate. We booked the hotel and the tour months in advance, and they reserve their skellig michael slots for hotel guests only. When we checked in, they said that they will know at 8am the morning of, if the tour will go out, and if so, we get our tickets at the check-in desk with them, and walk across the street to our boat (the lady clare). It was really easy and convenient. The morning of, our trip was on, so we went to breakfast at the hotel, which feels really rushed because everyone is heading out on the skellig michael tours. That whole morning felt stressful because the breakfast window is so short if you need to make a boat. But the food was good, the staff was friendly, and they had some good gluten free breakfast options, including gluten free bread. The hotel room was spacious and had a fan, which was nice! Around 1 am though, i could hear the people above us walking around and moving things; I was surprised how noisy it was between floors. But overall it was great and we were stay here again!",September 2018,The Moorings Guesthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635869-d627277-Reviews-The_Moorings_Guesthouse-Portmagee_County_Kerry.html,"Portmagee, Ireland",hotels,4.0,4.5
easy and modern hotel,"We were a little nervous about the self check-in and pin number that gets emailed, but it actually was awesome! They have a little machine by the front door and all you do is enter in the pin number they email you and the door opens. they then have a keypad next to all the room doors and you just enter the pin at your door and it opens. it was actually really nice to not have to keep track of a room key. The shower was reaally nice and enjoyable. The breakfast options were limited (not many gluten free options) but the coffee/espresso machine was awesome! The room got a little hot, even with the windows open and fan on. For some reason the way the windows open, the air doesnt come in well. But overall it was a great hotel with plenty of easy parking spots right around. We really liked staying here. It was about a 5 min drive into reykjavik and there is free parking in the city after 6pm so that was really nice and easy.",September 2018,Nordurey Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189970-d10786859-Reviews-Nordurey_Hotel-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",hotels,5.0,4.0
great staff and good food,"We both ordered the icelandic burger, which was good and a little bit different. The wait staff was great! They were very friendly and knowledgeable about gluten free options, and hadgluten free bread they can use for the bun. They also offered to add a side salad instead of the fries for me since there is cross contamination with the fryer. Definitely recommend this place.",September 2018,Islenski barinn The Icelandic Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d1870842-Reviews-Islenski_barinn_The_Icelandic_Bar-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Average but wouldnt go back,"This place was different than we were expecting. They have a menu that you order off of, or you can do the buffet. if you order off the menu, the soup of the day is included, as well as a section of the buffet (a little lettuce container and some other appetizer type of options). I ordered the seafood pan, which was expensive for what you get, ever by iceland standards [5400 ISK=~$50], which ended up being a pretty oily pile of average seafood (cod, salmon and shrimp) that didn't have quality flavor for that price. I also have a gluten allergy and did not think this restaurant was a good option. They were really kind and willing to try to accommodate this allergy, saying they would leave out the flour, but i definitely did not feel confident that all the other ingredients they were going to use were gluten free, and my stomach did hurt afterward. I couldnt have the soup of the day because it had gluten, which was a bummer since i technically paid for it, as it was included in my entree, and the buffet really felt like a shot in the dark as far as if it was gluten free. The only thing i really enjoyed the taste of from the buffet was the beets.",September 2018,Sjavarbarinn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d1487004-Reviews-Sjavarbarinn-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Nice atmosphere and good food,"The food here was good and the atmosphere was nice. The menu did not have any sort of labeling for gluten free unfortunately, and our waiter didn't seem to know much about gluten free options. I have a gluten allergy, but since we were there, I ordered something that seemed to be a semi-safe option based on the ingredients listed on the menu, and it was the arctic char. I asked for it to be gluten free and just crossed my fingers that the actual chef would know what that meant, and be able to do it. When they brought out our food, i appreciated and felt a little more comfortable, that the staff person re-announced ""arctic char, gluten free"" when they handed me my food. they do not have gluten free bread unfortunately either.",September 2018,Geysir Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d11869659-Reviews-Geysir_Bistro-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,4.0,4.5
DELISH ARTIC CHAR PAN,"This place had a really cozy atmosphere and was very neat inside! It seems like a thing they do in iceland where they have a 'fish pan' section on the menu which is literally what it sounds like, they bring out a giant pan of all the food they cooked for you. It is so good! I have a gluten allergy and there were two things listed as gluten free on the menu. I ordered the artic char which was so delicious and amazing! the portions were a little bit smaller than i think they should have been, but not by much. Our waiter was kind. They do not have gluten free bread unfortunately. It is definitely pricey, but seems like everywhere is in iceland. artic char was about 3400 ISK, which is somewhere around $35-40.",September 2018,Messinn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d10094640-Reviews-Messinn-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Most amazing place ever!,"This was the most amazing place i have ever been too! What the monks accomplished when they lived and built here is truly unbelievable and this place is breathtaking! No matter what you do, go here!!! The day we went, the waters were a little choppy. We took anti-nausea meds on the way there and back and i still was miserable the entire way in and back. I don't normally get sea sick, but i truly wanted to die on the boat. I was THIS close to throwing up. People on our boat did. It is really as bad as it seems like the boat would be, but the island itself was really that amazing that it really is worth the miserable boat ride!!!",September 2018,Skellig Michael,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186610-d618321-Reviews-Skellig_Michael-County_Kerry.html,"County Kerry, Ireland",attractions,5.0,5.0
expensive but worth it!,"The whole locker room experience is a total clusterfluff, but once you actually get to the water, it's great! When you get there and go to the locker rooms, you can pick a locker, then you change to your suit. Then you head to the showers to rinse off first (which is required). they have 3 shower heads out in the open, while the other 8-10 are stalls have doors. Each stall has shampoo/body wash and conditioner. There is always a stall open, and if you have to wait, it's only a couple minutes and no one is hurrying anyone. You also can go back to your locker as much as you want. They have qtips, & hairdryers in the locker rooms too. It is definitely possible to not get your hair wet at all though, but you probably want to wash it afterward anyway from all the silicia steam in the lagoon. You get a drink included in your admission cost, and they have a lot of great options including many different beers, wines, smoothies/juices etc. You also can stay as long as you want!",September 2018,Blue Lagoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608874-d207805-Reviews-Blue_Lagoon-Grindavik_Reykjanes_Peninsula.html,"Grindavik, Iceland",attractions,5.0,4.5
great drink options and fun atmosphere!,"They had great live trad music, plenty of space and lots of great drink options!

Delicious!,"The fish and chips were great here! Lots of options as to what kind of fish you want too, and large portions. Literally everything at this restaurant goes through their fryer, so if you need to eat gluten free, do not go here.
