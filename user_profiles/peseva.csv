Not worth it,"After just visiting similar malls in Italy and LA, we concluded that the selection of designer items is very limited, some 3 season old, and the prices are almost double than other outlet malls. I found better selection and prices in the center of Vienna. It is a good choice if you go for more mid-range labels, especially sports labels, but for A list designer is a total waste of time. Also, try to rent a car, as coming with the bus is the lottery of being able to come back",January 2020,Designer Outlet Parndorf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1572387-d1963632-Reviews-Designer_Outlet_Parndorf-Parndorf_Burgenland.html,"Parndorf, Austria",attractions,3.0,4.0
Traditional food,"The traditional Viennese schnitzel is very good as the other dishes we tried from the menu. The dessert was great. We didn't have reservation and we were lucky to find a table. The staff is fast, useful and attentive. The only downside is that the tables are so stuck to one another so you just can't help overhearing other conversations. Maybe it is different with the spring-summer terrace.",January 2020,Plachuttas Gasthaus zur Oper,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190454-d2365657-Reviews-Plachuttas_Gasthaus_zur_Oper-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Almost royal - like,"After coming to Vienna many times, discovering this spot was probably the best surprise. On our first visit, we went on the second floor, there was a long and slow line, but my friend convinced me it was worth waiting, and she was right. The place is fancy, warm, sophisticated. The choice of sweet delights and drinks is really fine. Unfortunately, the top floor has limited working hours and they were closing down late afternoon. Next time we came back, we opt for the first floor, luckily there were no waiting lines as it was during the work hours. The first floor was even better. I found my favourite drink, the Gerstner special Baronini drink. Filled up the present basket on the ground floor with dessert boxes and mini bottles of wine. Just love this place",January 2020,Gerstner K.u.K Hofzuckerbacker,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190454-d7382239-Reviews-Gerstner_K_u_K_Hofzuckerbacker-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Can't get more traditional then this,"We went on the recommendation from friends who live in Vienna, after a long day of traveling and sightseeing. We ere lucky there was no waiting line and we didn´t need a reservation. The service was nice and the food arrived fast. We truly enjoyed the traditional Austrian plates. The schnitzels were so big, as my daughter joked as a ""car wheel"". The menu is limited to a few specialties of the restaurant but all the other food options we tried were delicious. Definitely a recommendation",January 2020,Figlmuller,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190454-d711471-Reviews-Figlmuller-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Brilliant combination between museum and palace,"Albertina is without a doubt one of the greatest art museums. It has a huge collection of works, especially from French impressionism including Monet, Picasso, Chagall.
The palace staterooms are worth a visit in their own right. They used to be the largest Habsburg residential palace were once lived in by the favourite daughter of Empress Maria Theresia, Archduchess Marie-Christine. The vibrant colors of the palace kept some of the original furniture. It is a true history journey, with spectacular esthetic, wealth and history. Every single room in the museum and the palace deserves a visit. Remarkable top to bottom mirrors combined with world art are just breathtaking. Put Albertin on your must-see list, you will not regret it",January 2020,Albertina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190454-d244507-Reviews-Albertina-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",attractions,5.0,4.5
One of the most beautiful cities in the world,"Vienna is one of the most beautiful, historically rich and overwhelmingly vibrant cities in the world, certainly in Europe. There are so many things to be seen in all aspects, history, art, architecture, but do take time to walk around instead of using the public transport (although it is very well organized, safe, clean and punctual) all the time.

Great location,"The hotel location is really good, you are on the walking distance from the few important spots in the city, like the Opera house, St. Stephen's Cathedral or Belvedere museum on the other side. The room was special and with a nice view. The breakfast was truly superb, excellent choice and stunning view from the restaurant. On the downside, was the service. The reception staff and concierge were not helpful at all during our attempt to get to Parndorf shopping, all they wanted to achieve was to get their partner company to drive us back and forth for absurd amount, without even trying to find another solution. Also, it was quite annoying that the mini bar in the room was locked, which was first time experience for us in a five-star hotel. We asked the front desk to unlock it, but they didn´t. After we left the money guarantee and asked for the second time they opened it. Besides these setbacks, the hotel is nice and comfortable, the pool and the spa are a real pleasure.",January 2020,Vienna Marriott Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190454-d229407-Reviews-Vienna_Marriott_Hotel-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",hotels,4.0,4.0
The best hidden gem in the city,"Amazing place, such a wonderful tribute to art, culture, sports. It is a true leisure spot for visitors. It is open to everyone, no reservations. The architecture is magnificent, the whole concept is remarkable. We spent the New Year's Eve there, and could not find any flaw. The library is just extraordinary, the parks, the green rooftop, the sledge park. There are permanent and temporary galleries, the National Opera Theater and the National Library are all part of it.

Worth a visit,"Do not miss to witness the part of the history, in many details and packed with facts.

We didn't get the room we asked and paid for,"For me, being a person who does not live on the seaside coast, is very important to have the sea view whenever I stay somewhere near the sea/ocean. When we choose this hotel, one of the pluses we counted on was the view. When we got there on a snowy and cold night after a prolonged journey, I was hoping for the room we asked and paid for. Upon check-in, I mentioned to the receptionist that we asked for the sea view room, and he convinced me that we have one with and the other without a balcony and sea view (we had a connected room for the children). Of course, we didn't get a sea view room, we got the street view, with a tiny glimpse of a boat somewhere further, above the rooftops. No sea view. As it was the night before New Year's Eve, we decided we are not going to destroy the holiday spirit of the family by fighting with the hotel staff. However, I just want to point out that the photos you see on the booking are not from the rooms they sell as sea view. Other amenities were decent, private parking at all times, a la card breakfast was really good, as there were not many other guests, polite reception staff and clean rooms.",December 2019,Glyfada Riviera Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562630-d233050-Reviews-Glyfada_Riviera_Hotel-Glyfada_Attica.html,"Glyfada, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.5

Don't get high expectations,"Do not get your hopes and expectations too high, as the place is probably not what you might expect. For a first time visitor, it is definitely one of the main visiting spots, but besides souvenir shops that all look alike and few cafes, there is not much else. The place is packed with people all the time, so be aware of pickpocketers.

Descent,"The position of the restaurant is fantastic, it wasn't on our list of planned stops, but we were hungry and happy that we didn't need a reservation. The food though was average, as no one in the kitchen was really trying too much, it was a bit overpriced and we had to ask several times for tap water.

Must visit L.A place,"If not for the story behind it, or their image, this place deserves a visit for the truly tasty food. Most of the time, the waiting lines are very long, you might need to plan an additional 30 - 45 minutes of waiting.

Short and fun,"It wasn't on our list, but using the hop-on-hop-off bus, we got the free entrance with the bus tickets. It is a bit complicated that the tours a time-dependent so you can't get inside when it is suitable for you, but you got to wait for a certain period that they will share when you get there. However, the tour itself was interesting, history, stars, old-time Holywood glamour, lots of fun facts, unfortunately, we could not hear well what the guide was saying as the sound from the movie projection was extremely loud.

You can find good ice cream and better service somewhere else,"The ice cream is really good, typical Italian gelato, but the service was terrible. The guys working there were not patient while we were agreeing on the orders of our friend's group, making sounds and rolling eyes, while there was no one else inside but us.

The jewel,"It wasn't on our ""must visit"" list, actually, we got there without knowing what it is, while visiting nearby Staples Center and the Grammy Museum. It looked very nice and we loved the fact that was open without reservation. The service was spot on, but the food was OMG. Not over the top fancy, but sooo tasty. The size of those portions was out of this world. Especially the chocolate cake. It took three of us to share that ONE piece, and I'm quite sure the fourth person would have been useful too.

Remarkable artistic experience,"I'm not into contemporary art myself, but Broad is next level artistic, warm, true cultural center. I liked the Pop art of the 1960s and the collections and works by Roy Lichtenstein, Ed Ruscha, and Andy Warhol, but truly enjoyed the 1980s especially Keith Haring works. The highlight of the visit to me was the infinity mirrored room. Although the time inside was limited at 45 seconds, you got the feeling of being alone with millions of stars, quite exquisite. I would recommend it to every true art lover.

Breakfast with your feet in the sand and great view,"We were pleasantly surprised that we didn't need a reservation and we still got the table in the sand with an amazing sea view. The food was delicious, the service was fast and spotless and we enjoyed every minute in the November sun. The atmosphere was so laid back, very relaxed despite the fact that you could see some A-listers and people from the movie industry having Sunday breakfast here.

One of the most amazing spots in LA,"The atmosphere at the rooftop, was so great, that I'm willing to forget the self-service drinks politics. The sunset was so gorgeous in a late afternoon in fall, that for a few moments everyone went quiet, despite the fact that the bar was packed with people. The chill music was great, the band playing was ""walking"" the thin line of relaxation but a cheerful bit.

Expected much more,"As true music lovers, we were a bit disappointed with the quantity of information and the number of music stars included and available for visitors. There were so many amazing achievements and so many great musicians in history, it is shame that you could not see at least a small tribute for many of them. However, those that are included have a nice tribute and you might find some really interesting facts. It is a small museum, it will not provide entertainment for more than 60 -90 minutes.

The Observatory holds public viewing events for most lunar and solar eclipses. There are different shows that are perfectly done, I would suggest Centered in the Universe. Be aware that you need to be there at least an hour and a half to buy tickets for the show, as there are lines. The entrance to the observatory is free of charge.

The room maintenance was spotless, always with little sweet daily presents. The food in the restaurant was great, the menu was limited but the quality of the food was beyond great, the breakfast options were especially good.

Disappointing,"It was our third time to stay in this hotel and we were really looking forward to our next visit to Frankfurt. Unfortunately, we had some problems with the flight that was late due to technical problems, so we arrived at the hotel at 3 in the morning, exhausted and eager to get to our room. Imagine our surprise when the man at the reception told us that, because we were late, there are no rooms available. Shocked, I showed him our invoice with a pre-paid for all of our stay (3 nights). He panicked for a moment, but then told us that we were actually lucky as there was just one room available. Of course, the room did not fulfill any of our demands mentioned in the booking ( separate beds, street view...). We got a joint bed, a view between two walls, as we got the room for disabled persons as everything in it was made suitable for their needs, which was problematic for us, as we are tall people and could not use the bathroom amenities. Nevertheless, as we were in Frankfurt for a joyful event, we decided that we will enjoy our stay as much as we can. For the following morning, we got to the breakfast area a few minutes before closing down. as soon as we got to the restaurant, we cross the path with a mouse. Yes, a real, live rat. My daughter ( as well as few other ladies sitting) screamed, as I ran to the waitress and told her they have a rat around the food area, to which she waved her hand and told me: yeah, yeah, we know. For the rest of our stay, we only had coffee in the restaurant. So, this is not the same hotel that I remembered from few years back. At this point, I'm sorry for the huge amount we paid thinking we are heading to a five-star hotel when all we got was a below-average experience and no explanation or apology for the mistreatment. So, do avoid, although the location is very good, there are plenty of other opinions nearby.",October 2019,Flemings Selection Hotel Frankfurt-City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187337-d1018893-Reviews-Flemings_Selection_Hotel_Frankfurt_City-Frankfurt_Hesse.html,"Frankfurt, Germany",hotels,1.0,3.5

Great potential to be the best in the area,"We were pleasantly surprised by how lovely the hotel is, having to book it only a few days prior to our arrival. We stayed in the newer part of the resort, and the rooms were spacious and clean.
Good sides: Great garden area, good rooms with a functional kitchen (although our fridge was opening towards the wall), nice beach, the staff especially at the beach bar very nice. The toiletries are awesome. There is plenty of parking spots and they have extra hotel security at the gate.
Downside: The resort is big, but is lacking good entertainment activities. We were traveling with teen kids and literally there is nothing to do in the evening if you decide to stay in the hotel. The lobby needs some atmosphere to feel a bit more lively, the rooms need some character details to give them individuality. The food in the restaurant was of good quality, but the choices were poor. If you stay more then 4 days, you can go to breakfast with eyes closed. We asked to pay extra in order to get the room with a sea view, but we were told it's not possible because we didn't book directly with them, but with a travel agency. So the reception needs to be more flexible.
However, this is a nice hotel, with good possibilities for improvements in order to shine bright in the area of Halkidiki.",August 2019,Kassandra Palace Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g663146-d260390-Reviews-Kassandra_Palace_Hotel_Spa-Kriopigi_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,"Kriopigi, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Our most favorable summer hotel in Turkey,"Honestly, it was much better than the last time we stayed here. This is a hotel that is loved by every member of our family, great for all generations. We asked for a good view, and got the sixth-floor corner room on the west side, which we loved because we could watch the sea and the beautiful beach, but also enjoying the sunsets every single day. They made some changes from last year, adding new fun stations, some activities, and they even fixed the wifi, that the signal was strong on the beach as it was oin the lobby. The beach was fabulous, no fight over the sunbeds, there is always a free spot in the first rows (unless you go there at noon), enough tables, beds, towels. The staff can not be friendlier, always smiling an chatty. My husband and I were spending realy nice time at the chillout bar which is 16+, so no noise, always clean sitting sets, great cocktails. During our stay, they even change the whole design completely, from white to blue, all clean and perfectly stylish. Our girls were being preoccupied with many activities in their clubs, the junior for up to 13 years and the teen clubs for 13+. They kept them busy and enjoying the activities and new friendships, so many things for everyone. Special thanks to Mr. Andrew, the leader of the teens club, for taking such good care of our daughter the second year in a row. We loved the a la card restaurants, especially the Fish one. You get served with the perfect food, amazing location, and the best sunset. Adorable. Our room was spotless and our housekeeping lady had a great sense of humor that she showed over the towel animals she left on our bed. We loved them. All in all, the highest recommendation for Tui, we can't wait to come back.",July 2019,TUI MAGIC LIFE Masmavi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312725-d9997515-Reviews-TUI_MAGIC_LIFE_Masmavi-Belek_Serik_District_Turkish_Mediterranean_Coast.html,"Belek, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5
Impressed by details,"We were impressed by the attention paid on every single detail in this hotel. The decoration of the rooms, everything is stylish and new, modern and of good quality, beddings and the room details, the toiletries, the towels, the welcome package in the lobby, the restaurant, the way of serving the food, the pool bar, everything is perfect to the core. The management knows their job very well. On the plus side, it is an adults-only hotel, which is something new to me in Turkey, but the concept is very well worked upon. On the downside is the distance from the beach, there is about 10 minutes of a walk, which is not far unless is 40 degrees. This means no sea view, but there is a very good pool view. This is a very enjoyable hotel and I loved every minute of our stay. As guests, we were very well taken care of. Only the highest recommendation for Raga.",May 2019,The Raga Side Fine Dining,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297968-d13375544-Reviews-The_Raga_Side_Fine_Dining-Side_Manavgat_Turkish_Mediterranean_Coast.html,"Side, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5
No wow effect here,"Aside from the tunnel that is spectacular by itself and is fun to walk through, (if you are lucky not to go with dozens of other visitors) the rest of it was a bit disappointing.

The ticket price is quite high, so not sure if it's worth a half-day of your vacation.",May 2019,Skip the Line: Antalya Aquarium Ticket with Optional Transfer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g297962-d12876059-Skip_the_Line_Antalya_Aquarium_Ticket_with_Optional_Transfer-Antalya_Turkish_Medit.html,"Antalya, Turkey",activities,3.0,3.0
Good potential to become awesome,"One of the most family-friendly hotels we have ever been to. The room was lovely, and the view was very good. The pools were great, the food choices limitless, the restaurant atmosphere was very good having, no crowds, or fights over food. There are so many things to do, especially aiming towards young kids. The beach was phenomenal and the lobby bar staff, as well as other bars personal, deserve 5 star for their efforts and good service. We had a great time in the entertaining area, although it was tiny and it was very hot inside. I'll take away a star from the review because of the entertainment team. We were staying as a group of friends, and the entertainment team was quite persistent in taking us to the disco area, which was fine. Unless the moment we got there, they would concentrate on the russion guests and their choice of music. Also, the bar service at the club was slow and selective over which guests get to be served first.

Time well spent,"A fantastic combination to feel and learn a bit of history and enjoy the amazing photo opportunity. In between the sea and the harbor, the walk towards it is a pure pleasure.

Well worth a visit,"You can't be wrong with a visit to the Land of legends. The place is mesmerizing, just great for everybody, small kids, big kids, friends, couples, there are so many things to do. If you are an adrenaline junkie, you can get your head spinning on the rollercoaster, rockets and other activities for brave people. The lazy river was fantastic, the wave pool, the plane flight. There is a great choice of restaurants, places for ice creams and desserts, also there is a Starbucks nearby (but not in the complex of the activities). Even if not everybody from your company like adrenaline activities, there are plenty of other things to do. The shopping street at the entrance of the park is one of them.

Great choice for families,"It is a great example of classical Turkish hospitality, very nice rooms, clean amenities, great entertainment. The beach is a sandy and clean, very good organization, there is a plant of food choices, although sometimes the atmosphere in the restaurants can be frantic. I wish they would have more rooms or facilities with direct view to the sea, I kind of missed to opportunity to watch the sunrises and sunsets unless you are not on the beach. We were a group of friends and at nights, while being in the lobby they would ask us to be quiet because of the rooms just above it, which was not very practical.

Unfortunately, many, many steps can make the visit quite tiring to the elderly people and families with young children. However, the view from up there is just magnificent. Scrolling down the narrow streets, it is like a step into the past. But, being as one of the most popular places in Paris, it is expected to be blocked with tourists.

Not worth it,"The service was terrible. We were sited in the middle of the restaurant on a tiny table, that barely fit our drinks and glasses, not to mention the food. There was no place to put our shopping bags, nor our personal bags. Extremely inconvenient and not pleasurable at all. Waited for 10 minutes to get the second drink, and another 15 to get the ketchup. And another 10 to get the bill. The food was average, and the prices skyrocketed.

Amazing as always,"No matter how many times you go to Paris, or how many times you go to Louvre, there is always something new, or something you missed the previous times, or something you didn't have time to dedicate with certain exhibitions. Louvre can never disappoint. The last time I visited, had this absolutely fantastic opportunity to stand in front of Mona Lisa, alone. Alone. No crowds, no pushing, no photo ops. After so many times visiting this monument for human civilization, there are few things I learned:
- get your electronic ticket, you still get in line, but the waiting is way shorter then with regular
- prepare your self for some waiting( for entrance, for tickets if you don't have one, for audio guides, for coffees) It is a huge place, with thousands of people visiting it every day
- Start from the top and move to the ground level, it is easier to navigate through so many exhibition points
- Put on a comfortable shoes and clothes, it is a looong walk through art
- do not get disappointed if you don't get to enter everywhere or see everything. It is a great chance for the next time round

Great escape room,"It was a lovely winter experience. The hotel is new and modern, although the rooms still have the feeling of a bit of rustic, mountain style. The quality of the food and the restaurant was excellent. The spa center and the pool is also good entertainment, but there is a need to pay more attention on the level of maintaining the cleanness of the pool, especially after the busy hours.

However if you travel as a couple or with teenagers, it might be a bit boring. There are no evening activities, basically nothing to entertain with after the dinner hours. Regarding the rooms, there are specious and clean, with nice view of the surrounding nature. Breakfast is good, with great choices of food, but it is always so crowded in the restaurant, which completely kills any feeling of peace and calmness. As this is a big hotel, and there are many families with small children, everywhere is crowded and loud. The city center is quite far from the hotel, but there is an option to use the bus that has a route only from/to the hotel.
