We asked where the gate was and they said it would be ""up"" 15 minutes before boarding. kinda hard when we were in a strange airport. It is a zoo, so difficult to find gates. The aircraft had no real bus. class. They just give u 3 seats, no more room, very crowded. Why pay for bus.class?? Seats were just like coach class.

"Nice location, quiet resort","This is truly a beautiful area in CO. This was an RCI exchange. It is rated as a Gold Crown.
I can't say enough about the staff. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome and do everything to make sure your visit is pleasant. We've been to lots of resorts (35 yrs. of exchanging) and this is one of the best for the staff. The condo is really large. We had a one bedroom and it definitely would be large enough for more children or adults. It had 2 full bathrooms! Washer and dryer. Full kitchen.
Beautiful living area with fireplace.
Only negative: The ""clubhouse"" is not the best. The first thing you see when leaving the parking lot is the large dumpster near the front door. Yuk! We were about an hour early for check-in and they said we could wait outside on the patio because inside was very hot from the pool. The patio was very dirty and full of bird droppings. Had to clean chairs before we could sit down. We were hoping that our experience with the condo was better than the first opinion.

Our room was VERY small, but accommodating. Only complaint was the bath room was ""postage stamp"" size! Stayed in a lot of hotels in US and Europe and I think this was the smallest!

"Great Staff, small room","We stayed here 5 nights Thanksgiving week. The hotel is on the river. The river and river walk is fabulous!
We paid more for a ""river view"". It was nice, lots of trees, but we could see the river. The staff is exceptional. Very friendly and really do help you see all the SA sights. They always have time for their customers.
The room is not small it is VERY small. I'm glad we only brought one suitcase. A second wouldn't fit in the room! We were not in the room much, so it was OK. I thought for the price, it should have been larger. Why they put a hugh reclining chair in the room, I will never understand.
The breakfast is really nice and lots of it. You can always find something you like. Only bad thing is the TV is really loud and CNN news. Who wants that?? I noticed everyone sat as far away from the TV as possible.
I couldn't say anything good about the evening reception. Drinks are very small and ""watered down"". Very friendly hostess. Food was not good.
We loved our trip to SA and would definitely go back.

Took the trolley tour and it was great.",November 2009,Drury Inn & Suites San Antonio Riverwalk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60956-d123559-Reviews-Drury_Inn_Suites_San_Antonio_Riverwalk-San_Antonio_Texas.html,"San Antonio, Texas",hotels,4.0,4.5
OK hotel,"Typical casino hotel, very small room. Only perks was a coffee pot. No refrigerator, microwave. Bath room looked old and VERY small, but there were 2 sinks, one was in the bathroom entry and made it very convenient. Shower was terrible, the water pressure was almost not there, but the towels were great and lots of them.
Best part of the hotel: Roxy's bar and restaurant. We ate 5 meals there and went to the martini bar 7 nights! Best in town. Fabulous hostess there named ""Marla"" (I think) She is definitely an asset to the restaurant. All the staff were great in the hotel.",September 2009,Eldorado Resort Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45992-d114915-Reviews-Eldorado_Resort_Casino-Reno_Nevada.html,"Reno, Nevada",hotels,3.0,4.5
Fabulous Hotel,"We were so glad we chose this hotel. It was alot more expensive, but the convenience to the airport was wonderful. When we arrived in Frankfurt it was raining and to just walk across the street to the hotel was so very nice.
If you have never been in the Frankfurt Airport it is very confusing! The hotel is not easy to find from the baggage pick-up, but it is wonderful once we found it.
We walked to the airport to have dinner, the hotel restaurant didn't seem to great. The only restaurant in that part of the airport was very good and we really enjoyed watching all the airplanes.
We difinitely recommend this hotel. Staff is really friendly and seem to go out of their way to make your visit good.",July 2009,Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel & Conference Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187337-d202274-Reviews-Sheraton_Frankfurt_Airport_Hotel_Conference_Center-Frankfurt_Hesse.html,"Frankfurt, Germany",hotels,5.0,4.0
"very expensive, not that great","Stayed here 5 nights for a golf tournment. Shared with 2 other women.
The space was very adequate. Staff was very friendly, breakfast was very good. Every thing in the suite was working and beds were nice.
The BAD: 3-women need the bath and kitchen cleaned every day. The only housekeeping we received: towels picked up, beds made, trash emptied. 3-women need showers and toilets cleaned!!. When we complained they showed us a letter saying that's all we were going to have. 5 nights no cleaning!!
YUK
The evening ""reception"" was only on Tues., Wed, Thurs. I suppose these are the ""slow"" nights.
I guess they have never been to a Hilton. I think this is part of the Holiday Inn group.",June 2008,Staybridge Suites San Angelo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g56609-d230536-Reviews-Staybridge_Suites_San_Angelo-San_Angelo_Texas.html,"San Angelo, Texas",hotels,2.0,4.0
Great hotel for the price.,"My husband and I stayed here two nights before leaving on a cruise. I certainly had my doubts after reading several reviews.

We really enjoyed this hotel. It was all-inclusive and we never had to worry about leaving for meals. The food in the buffet was really not to our tastes, but the speciality restaurant was fabulous. I can't say enough about the service.
Also we had lunch by the pool and it was great also. The breakfast buffet was good also. If going, I would eat only breakfast at the buffet. Lots and lots of Mexican dishes that I couldn't identify.
The front desk was very unfriendly. I think perhaps they did not speak English and didn't understand most we were saying.
Our room was small, but very clean and adequate for 2-nites.
The view from the balcony was wonderful!
Problem: Shower water went rapidly from HOT to cold. (whenever someone flushed)

There were no time share offers. No one even approached us.

I would return. Several couples on our ship told us how much the food was at their 4 & 5 star hotels, we decided that we certainly made the correct choice.",January 2008,Park Royal Beach Acapulco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150787-d154850-Reviews-Park_Royal_Beach_Acapulco-Acapulco_Pacific_Coast.html,"Acapulco, Mexico",hotels,4.0,3.5
