Perfect for access to the airport,Clean bright and tidy. The meals are adequate. The staff very helpful. It is the nearest hotel to the airport - just across the road.

Rubbish

719330389

The Candia is located in a run-down residential area where graffiti seems to be a national past time. It is next to a busy main dual carriageway, beside the main railway line and station and beyond this another major road. There is no such thing as a quiet room – 24 hours a day.
Athens is a sprawling metropolis the majority of which is run down. People we spoke who said parking is impossible. They had spent 45 minutes looking.
The Candia is not a 4 Star Hotel. Whilst the public areas are well maintained, clean and tidy. The same cannot be said for the rooms.
Our first room was a three bedded spartan space which was more like a Hostel than a hotel. It was shoddy and in need of renovation. The shower fitting had fallen off the wall. We had asked for a quiet room on a high floor but were given one on the third floor with a view of the derelict apartment block with cracked concrete and peeling paintwork across a narrow road. It took me thirty minutes to get the aircon working even then it did little to cool the room. The walls are paper thin. We were woken at 6.00 to the sound of the lads next door laughing and joking. They were not shouting but it did sound as though they were in our room.
We moved the following morning to a twin room which was an improvement – three star at best with a view of the railway station and trains every 15 minutes.
The majority of the rooms in the hotel are triples which probably accounts for the large volume of young people and groups who are probably used to hostels.
The roof terrace is ok if you take care not to trip on the broken tiles and use a towel on the rusty chairs. The ‘swimming pool’ is actually an oval ‘plunge pool’ about 25 ft x 15 feet. Six people make it a crowd.
There is no need to have a hotel 45 minutes from the airport. There are far better areas nearer - even beside the beach a far nicer area. Stay near any of the Hop On Hop Off bus routes and you can go anywhere and see everything in the city.",September 2019,Candia Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d228867-Reviews-Candia_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,2.0,3.0
Busy Family Resort,"Definitely a family resort. Three pools all full of families enjoying themselves loudly. If you are looking for a quiet holiday this is not for you. The place for a shaded area drink is the snack bar but don't expect quiet - the bar staff treat this area as their private disco - and loud beat music all day.
The rooms are ok but the bathrooms are tiny. Bigger than a size 14 and you will have trouble getting in and out of the shower.
The food is bland and there is no variety and is never hot. If you enjoy wine bring your own. The local brew is terrible.
The staff could do with some training and a shake up - service is not good.",September 2019,Alykanas Village Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1191028-d515877-Reviews-Alykanas_Village_Hotel-Alykanas_Zakynthos_Ionian_Islands.html,"Zakynthos, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
Spoiled Birthday Celebration,"Booked online 3 months in advance we were not given the room we had requested. It took an hour of standing around to get the problem sorted. Not what you expect from a hotel of this standing.
The booking made with reception for dinner was confirmed in an email but the restaurant had no record of it when we checked in.
The staff were well trained, helpful and mannerly.
The main building is in need of a makeover showing its age. The balcony railing off our room was dilapidated and the wood rotten.

Interesting,"The main block at Bellevue situated on the beach front (all stones and pebbles) has been tastefully refurbished to a high standard. Unfortunately, this has not been carried through to the adjacent annexes which remain 3 star-.
The shower fitting fell off the wall on day one. The ceiling in the bathroom (wallpapered with wood chip and painted over to hide the cracks) had wooden trim hanging off. The shower was tiny (anybody over size 14 would not be able to move around) The room is small. The TV does not have international news channels. The best feature was the balcony although unlike the main building you have very restricted views through the trees. Housekeeping was exceptional.
The pool area is clean and has lots of sun beds some shaded by trees.
The food is 2-star buffet style. Breakfast is the same every day whilst dinner does vary but very basic. Wine is served free of charge at dinner although very similar to Retsina. There are no other choices. If you are a G&T fan they do not stock Tonic Water.

Management Issues,This hotel is struggling to cope with clients due to insufficient staff. A problem know to the management but not addressed. One manager (Debra Johnson) officially Food and Beverage Supervisor is trying to cope with the whole hotel. Whist she does an excellent job nobody can be expected to be everywhere all the time.,December 2017,Hilton Fort Lauderdale Marina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34227-d84471-Reviews-Hilton_Fort_Lauderdale_Marina-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",hotels,4.0,3.5
Tied but Trying,"Alua Sol is a square 1960’s building with a recent makeover that is now showing signs of wear and tear. Public areas are still pristine whereas rooms are less. Peeling paint and rust stains around the bath. Towels are more grey than white. Whilst Alua has a 4-star rating I would say that it is approaching 3 Star.

Staff are generally polite and efficient and housekeeping is very good.

The buffet breakfast is plentiful if somewhat lacking in variety. After 4 days of the same choice one tends to despair. The cooked food is served warm rather than hot with the cold choice a mixture of plastic meat and cheese. Don’t be in too much of a hurry to fill your coffee or tea cup as it is served from a machine after a long queue.

The pool area is tidy with comfortable loungers but is too small for the hotel occupancy.

Attention to problems raised is slow. We had a problem with the bed which sounded like a scalded cat whenever you turned over. Some oil on the wheels would have fixed it. It took 3 days before the problem was partially resolved. At least we were not woken up as often.",September 2017,AluaSoul Palma (Adults Only),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580295-d290632-Reviews-AluaSoul_Palma_Adults_Only-Can_Pastilla_Majorca_Balearic_Islands.html,"Majorca, Spain",hotels,3.0,4.0

Great accommodation noisey music,"This 2/3 star hotel/apartment complex has recently had a makeover and is well maintained by a short staffed housekeeping crew. A gay friendly resort with heterosexuals in the minority. If this offends you then it is not for you. We found all guests polite and courteous as were the staff. The hotel is a 15 minute walk from the airport bus stop and a 10 minute walk to the Eroski supermarket. There is a superette 2 minutes away.
Breakfast is included in the cost of hotel rooms but not the apartments where a charge of €9.00 ea. is made. There is a great variety of cereals fruit and cold meat and cheese. Hot food consists of bacon and fried eggs. They have installed an automatic coffee machine dispensing a variety of coffees and hot water for teas. As this process takes time there is always a queue.
The one disappointment which caused at least one guest to check out early and will stop us from returning is the volume of music at the pool. The pool which is operated separately from the hotel starts music at 9.00 am at a reasonable level which is continually raised as the day progresses. By 4.00 pm you are listening to disco /clubbing music which drowns out conversation on hotel balconies across the road. We also experienced a DJ for 2 afternoons – we went for a walk. Music continues until the pool restaurant closes at 1.00 am - when the staff cleaning up play their music. Complaining to the hotel achieves nothing as they have no control over the management of the pool area.",June 2017,Hotel Cenit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g664638-d238674-Reviews-Hotel_Cenit-Ibiza_Town_Ibiza_Balearic_Islands.html,"Ibiza, Spain",hotels,4.0,3.5

Great Resort Poor Food,"Set beside the beach alongside a three mile promenade the beautiful grounds are tastefully landscaped (appx 20 acres) with well maintained gardens and lots of paved areas for sunbeds. A Dedicated play area for children which you may want to avoid if you are there for a quiet and peaceful break. There are three bars opening at different times between 10.00 and 12.00. Three large outdoor pools (one saltwater) and a heated indoor pool usually full of children all competing for airspace and creating a loud cacophony. Dunas is a Club Hotel aimed at families. We were lucky to have only 400 guests which provided plenty of space. I would not like to think of the frenetic activity when it has 1200 guests with a large proportion of children during the school holidays
Spacious rooms and bathrooms with a large walk in shower recently refurbished and well maintained by housekeeping. A good-sized balcony for watching the sun go down.
The reception area and lounge is enormous and features lots of varied seating.
Staff are courteous and friendly always there to help.
The main disappointment was the food. Two main restaurants (one for breakfast and lunch and one for evening dining). Two other (one Moroccan and one Asian) alternating which evenings they open. All restaurants are buffet style. The choice of food never varies is bland and never hot. By the time you reach your table most of it is decidedly cool. Breakfast is probably the best meal if you ignore the plastic cheese, plastic meat and tinned fruit. Again, the dishes never vary with the same food on the same shelf every day.
The sun in March is hot but not excessively. The wind off the sea is cold. Mornings and evenings are cool to chilly so do not forget a sweater and if you plan to walk the promenade a thin anorak is essential.

Tiny Room Uncaring Staff,"The building has undergone a refurbishment and looks clean and tidy. It is a mix of residents and rental guests. However, we were given a Standard Studio despite having a confirmation for a Superior Studio. This was tiny and very basic, shades of Etap. There is not room enough for two people cannot pass. We also had a locked connecting door (not advertised) which did not stop the sound of revellers arriving home in the early hours of the morning.

You are provided with 3 small bottles of toiletries and two towels (bath and hand) which are not changed or replaced during your stay. Neither are the sheets which given the hot nights should have been changed daily. The kitchen is in fact a small kitchenette with just a microwave and two burner hotplate. It does benefit from a dishwasher and washing machine (necessary when you need to wash the towels provided).

The staff were distant and were not always aware of what service they should provide. We tried to arrange a late checkout which was advertised in the inroom information pack at €11.5 an Hour. However, none of the reception staff were aware of this arrangement and had to refer it to an absent manager, which had us waiting around for hours for some clarification and even then we were not able to get the extension we required and had to spend two hours sitting around the pool with our baggage.

The swimming pool is not located as, we were led to believe, on the roof terrace but at the back of the building on the 1st floor surrounded by and overlooked by many local basic apartments decorated with a variety of washing. It does not benefit from sunshine and the pool is only 1 metre wide. No room for a swim.

The view from our balcony was terrible. Lots of other roof terraces festooned with a myriad of aerials vents and a variety of added shacks.

Be aware that this building is surrounded by busy main streets full of bustling cars and thousands of scooters and motor bikes. The result is a continual cacophony of traffic noises till the early hours of the morning.",September 2016,Aramunt Apartments,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d930548-Reviews-Aramunt_Apartments-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,2.0,4.0

This is not a sexist comment but I am aware their activities could offend some people. The hotel construction is old so expect to here the click and clatter of guests arriving throughout the night as the doors and walls are not soundproof.
