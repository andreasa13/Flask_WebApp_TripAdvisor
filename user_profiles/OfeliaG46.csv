gastronomic memories before lockdown,"My small group of lady friends decided to go to this restaurant for their famous dumplings as well as to enjoy an uncluttered view of the Manila Bay. We came quite early and had a good table for four. Service was fast and we regaled tasting each dish that was brought in. We had bean curds quite out of the ordinary, noodles, duck which we enveloped in light crêpes, a cool crunchy cucumber salad and the pièce de résistance were the xiao long bao dumplings. You are supposed to start in the middle which was the classic dumpling, then taste the green ginseng one. Going clockwise, the foie gras afterwards, then black truffle, followed by cheese, crab roe, garlic and finally the Szechuan dumpling. It was a feast for the palate and also for the eyes. In these ""deprived"" moments of a lockdown, memories of that lunch will sustain us and we surely will reward ourselves with another visit once we are able to and have survived!",March 2020,Paradise Dynasty Philippines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298452-d11845018-Reviews-Paradise_Dynasty_Philippines-Pasay_Metro_Manila_Luzon.html,"Luzon, Philippines",restaurants,5.0,4.0
good place for a ladies' lunch,"Found in the Capitol Commons of Pasig, there are a number of places to eat but a friend chose this place as they gave us a small private room where we could talk, laugh and of course order some food even if the UCC is basically a coffeeshop. Each one in our group ordered differently from the other. I had a delicious crispy walnut, cranberry and gorgonzola salad which was hefty enough that I didn't order anything more. Others had their mushroom soup with truffle oil and I settled for an affolata in guise of dessert as it was ice cream also came with espresso. My seatmate had crêpe samurai for which she had longed for! Overall impression was very good, food and service too.

an almost infinite stretch of beach and sand,"We came to visit St Efflam and it was low tide. There was this immense flat stretch of a beach with sand that was firm and scattered cockle shells. On the right was the promontory of the Grand Rocher. It was a calm November morning, no wind, a mother and child walking in the distance, the sun shining intermittently giving us a great postcard panorama.

an excellent dining experience,"It was a November evening when we left our hotel to go on an adventurous hunt for a place to have dinner knowing very well that most establishments would be close at this ""dead"" season of the year. But there was Le Gibus, all lighted up with the welcoming ""Ouvert"" sign. We were struck by the tasteful decor and I particularly loved the antique-looking china. We were informed that they were reeditions of plates of the 30s. With few clients that evening, we had the full but discreet attention of the owners. There was a wood grill beside which we sat as it was windy, wet and cold outside. And being in Brittany we took advantage of ordering sea food. We started with a hot fish soup garnished with a rouille, grated cheese and bread freshly toasted from the grill. Then we chose to have char-grilled soles with melted butter that came with a potato baked in the embers, a surprising ratatouille that was cooked with eggs, a small mound of tasty rice and half a cooked tomato all this accompanied by an excellent muscadet. It was really an excellent way of celebrating our Thanksgiving evening that we didn't think a dessert was necessary to cap the meal.",November 2019,Le Gibus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g425019-d1339532-Reviews-Le_Gibus-Locquirec_Finistere_Brittany.html,"Locquirec, France",restaurants,5.0,4.0
opened for us in spite of being closed for the season,"In November, most if not all hotels in seaside resorts are closed. We were fortunate to have the owner open one room for us in spite of the fact that they were closed for the season. We were given a room that could be opened directly from the exterior without going through the hotel. It seemed to be a room adapted for handicaps as from the parking there are no steps but just an easy ramp to get to the room with a view of the ocean. The room was clean, nicely provided with towels, TV, heating and a breakfast was thoughtfully provided for the next morning. We may not be able to describe the facilities of the hotel. But considering the kind and exceptional reception given to tired travellers (we drove 800 kms to Brittany), we would recommend this hotel anytime!",November 2019,Hotel les Panoramas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1150566-d1145670-Reviews-Hotel_les_Panoramas-Plestin_les_Greves_Cotes_d_Armor_Brittany.html,"Plestin les Greves, France",hotels,4.0,4.0
"delicous lunch, lovely setting","Tucked away in the old picturesque part of Sainte-Alvère and not even a year old is this new restaurant that is one of the rare places open in November when most of the Dordogne is already hibernating. It is an old house tastefully renovated, furnished with rough wooden tables, unmatched chairs all exuding a lot of charm. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. One big glass wall shows the kitchen where Raphael the chef whips up his dishes while gracious Gemma attends to the guests. We opted for the menu of the day starting with a delicious soup followed by a specialty of Reunion - the rugai. The apple crumble topped by a sherbet and an espresso ended a truly lovely lunch.",November 2019,DIX Restaurant & Chambres d'Hôtes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2562749-d19077775-Reviews-DIX_Restaurant_Chambres_d_Hotes-Sainte_Alvere_Dordogne_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Sainte-Alvere, France",restaurants,5.0,5.0

Check-in was efficiçent and while I was limited to only 2 luggages, a box of some 4 kilos, my 3rd checked in luggage was waved off as I barely exceeded the 40 kilos allowance. I was prepared for flights that didn't serve alcohol so if one cannot wean himself from this for the duration of the flight, better get the alcoholic drinks at the lounges while not on Saudi Arabian soil.

"good Thai food, quiet ambiance","In front a lush tropical garden along a long row of restaurants is this fairly inimate Thai restaurant. Many establishments in the Philippines usually have ambiance music often played quite loudly but here, there were just the clinks of cutlery on the dishes and quiet talks of other clients. It was wonderful to have normal conversations with friends throughout the dinner without having to raise one's voice above the music!. The food was very good, nicely presented. We particularly loved the crispy soft shell crab appetizers, the papaya salad and the pad thai which was brought to the table wrapped in an edible netting and later mixed wiith its ingredients by the waiter. The chicken pandan was a bit dry to my taste. Dessert was a delicious sticky rice and mangoes.

"Excellent, immense museum","After having visited the Acropolis in the morning and a well deserved rest and lunch, we were brought to this museum. We entered on a ramp that was elevated to respect the Roman ruins brought to light when the museum was being built. The building is immense, I presume, gigantic enough to house the treasures from the Acropolis. Artifacts are plentiful that many are displayed through transparent floors which made me quite uneasy. We did admire the original Caryatids and noticed a space among the 5 standing to indicate the ""missing"" 6th one, now in London as it had been taken by Lord Elgin. There are reconstitutions of the statuary of the pediments, showing Athena and Poseidon and other gods. There are actual reliefs of the metopes and the frieze and seating areas all along the glass walls to enable the viewer to linger longer on the reliefs. At one place, the Acropolis high above is seen through the glass wall. It was at this point that I realised we were going through the actual width and length of the Parthenon while viewing the frieze and metopes! The museum makes the experience of the Acropolis and the Parthenon really sink in.",September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
topiary at its marvellous best,"I had not visited the Jardins de Marqueyssac in probably a decade and had the happy opportunity to see it again accompanying some tourist friends. Marqueyssac is on a hilltop and as we parked the car, there was the Beynac château in the distance across the Dordogne river. The geographical position of this garden offers visitors an almost 360° view of the valley. This garden has flowers, minimal in quantity and limited to white and blue blossoms. But there are a thousand shades of green in the boxwood (of different varieties), rosemary, santoline etc. There is what seems to be a sea of green sponges made up of hand-trimmed box topiary. Very interesting organic shapes here contrast with the strict geometry of another excellent topiary garden at Eyrignac. The garden is more relaxed, in my opinion, than Eyrignac in the wooden arches that frame a shaded path, the whimsical chairs to sit on while enjoying the view, the mineral cliffs accented again by trimmed boxwood and a view of another picturesque village - La Roque Gageac. There is a café where we sat after the walk but service was slow. We didn't have time to visit the interior of the château.

THE monument!,"The Acropolis may have other monuments but the Parthenon is the summit of this hilltop citadel. The image may be too familiar from books, travel guides, TV etc but seeing it is really an indelible experience. We have learned of its history as first dedicated to Athena, then in Christian times became a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and later on became a mosque during the Ottoman occupation. Yes, it is still being restored from damages of the past, especially from the destruction wrought in the 17th century by the Italian Morosini because the Parthenon was used then as storage of Turkish artillery. What words can be added here to describe the marvelous building whose structure began in the 5th century BC? How the architects then leaned the columns slightly inwards, gave the columns a slight bulge and we are told they didn't use straight lines but the optical illusion is one of perfection! Happily some the Parthenon's sculptures have been saved for us to admire at various museums of the world.

the marvelous and mythic citadel,"Undeniably, the Acropolis stands as a magnificent monument to Greek and eventually Western art. I felt I had to be worthy of this fabulous site starting with the uphill climb to the imposing gateway or Propyleia. In the short distance to the right is the Parthenon, to my left was the Temple of Athena and the Erectheion. Other monuments built in white marble must have been gleaming and impressive sitting on this hilltop. We marvelled at the Parthenon, still undergoing restoration, some of its metopes still intact, The images of the Ionic columns of the Temple of Athena then the Caryatids will remain imprinted in our memories.

temple on scenic hilltop,"Going all the way from Athens is worth the almost 2-hour bus ride to the site of the Temple of Poseidon. Unlike the Acropolis which is always teeming with people, the site is on a spacious hilltop overlooking a sapphire sea. We visited in September so the beachgoers were also limited in numbers. A few sailboats added some poetry to the scene. Like the ¨Parthenon, the Temple of Poseidon is of the Doric style and may be less grandiose or imposing but is nevertheless graceful and harmonious. It seems that there was a ""sister"" temple on another nearby hill dedicated to Athena but this was so admired by the Romans that they dismantled and brought it to Rome. Now the temple is protected by a barrier, safe from vandals and taggers like Lord Byron who carved his name on one of the columns. There is a small charming flock of partridges, unafraid of visitors, who continually guard the Temple.",September 2019,Temple of Poseidon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g562628-d312283-Reviews-Temple_of_Poseidon-Sounio_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Sounio, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great places to eat,"We had a rendezvous with friends for dinner at a restaurant in Plaka, a very animated and lively place to enjoy Athens outside her monuments. There were so many attractive restaurants with charming tables on the sidewalk. The restaurant chosen had tables on the rooftop with a fabulous view of the city lighted up. There so many clients that even at this outdoor setting, the din had drowned out conversation with the other end of our table. Waiters were efficient enough but the food was just all right, nothing to rave about perhaps due to the fact that most clients were tourists like us. Maybe a less advertised place would have more quality in the food.

"Unique, priceless treasures","It was a welcome treat to come into the cool spacious interior after visiting the archeological site. The Museum houses artifacts that are proofs of the importance of the site. There are bronze offerings, statues, reliefs that make the gods of ancient Greece come to life. A huge sphinx from Naxos sits atop an Ionic column and must have asked Oedipus that famous riddle. Magnificently carved reliefs in the pediment renders homage to Apollo (as god of music) identified by his flute. The frieze also relates scenes from the Trojan war. I admired the depiction of a quadriga in the different subtle movements of the horses. Unforgettable too was the small kylix where Apollo, cradling his lute, pours a libation with a crow or raven watching. A pleasant surprise came with a statue of emperor Hadrian's beloved Antinoos whose beauty is forever unfading here. And a fitting climax to the visit was the Charioteer bringing immense joy and admiration. The statue though lacking its right arm had been very well preserved. A trip to the site and to the museum is simply fantastic.

Back to the Classical Past,"After lunch at the Omphalos restaurant, we headed for the Delphi site armed with hats, bottles of water and shod with reliable and comfortable walking shoes. This monumental complex is awesome as it had also played an important role in the lives and fortunes of ancient Greece. The grandiose natural setting was ""chosen"" as the 2 eagles released by Zeus crossed paths here making it the ""navel of the world"".. As one walks up, there is the Treasury of the Athenians which held the gifts offered. The green metallic column of intertwined serpents is a reminder of Apollo's slaying the Python. Some robust columns remain of the Temple of Apollo. Looking down to the valley behind us is the circular Tholon which we didn't have time to visit. Further up is the theatre and by this time heat and fatigue had overtaken us.

Seeing the huge number of tourists, I braced myself for the worse. The starter was a meli-melo of beet salad, a crusty unidentifiable and surprise! they were delicious!!! This was followed by a colourful mixed salad again, very tasty. The main course was a lamb stew that was tender and oozing with flavours.

Since we were one of the first visitors, once in the chapel, our guide who is also a contre-tenor sang a hymn to the Blessed Virgin and this transported us to the solemnity of another age. The iconography in this tiny chapel is, as in other monasteries with the Transfiguration painted opposite the Resurrection, the 4 Evangelists in the triangle spaces below the dome, the rows saints on the iconostatis etc. But what is amazing is that these frescoes have maintained their vibrant colours through the centuries.

Ancient Greece comes alive,"I was truly moved by the visit to this museum that houses royal tombs in the ancient capital of Aigai. Artifacts, fragments of bones, golden diadems, finely sculpted ivory, fresco paintings and actual intact tombs all attest to the wealth and the rituals that accompanied the kings to their last resting place. The quality of the artifacts as in the goldsmith's work, or the depiction of a woman's transparent silk bodice in a tiny ivory scultpure raise these objects to the level of high art and not just as craft. The fresco of the abduction of Persephone was painted with the skill of an artist who knew what perspective and foreshortening were centuries before the Romans or the Italian Renaissance. But beyond the display of wealth and power, I was touched by the unequal shin guards that identified with certitude the remains of Philip II as he was described to have had this leg deformation.

Remarkable mosaics,"Located in the Archeological Park, the ruins of this Roman villa is testimony of the opulence of the past. The vestiges cover over a thousand meters but most interesting are reconstructed mosaics that are sheltered in a building with raised paltforms for better viewing from above. The mosaics are presented, in my opinion out of context, as they must have been laid in various parts of the villa. However their being seen here all together facilitates our appreciation and admiration of them. Helpful signs enlighten as depictions of Greek myths may be quite obscure or unknown to the layman.

hotel with a kitchy charm,"Centrally located near a large shopping mall, easy access to taxis, and rooms opening to balconies are the positive aspects of this hotel. The staff, waiters were friendly and helpful. But we were at first surprised by the decor. Walls painted with figures from vases, Minoan painted columns, some mosaics, all challenged one's memory of images from Greek civilisation. To add to the ""puzzlement"" were the labyrinthine corridors lined with mirrors leading to the rooms. The pool of deep blue colour surrounded by blooming bougainvillas where we could have drinks or breakfast was charming enough.

Individual ""houses"" or villas rich in mosaics are richer if one is familiar with Greek mythology to appreciate the iconography.

We shared what we had chosen from the menu so each one could taste the delicious dishes. We had a lovely fresh vegetable salad with quail eggs and avocado. Fish grilled in a ""bag"", lemony skewered chicken and tender lamb chops were accompanied by a good local white wine. The terrace was pleasant and breezy and offered a panoramic view of Paphos up to the sea, inciting us to linger longer.

Some in the group had already been in this restaurant in the past and had excellent culinary memories. They were not wrong. We had a lovely amuse-bouche of a squash velouté accompanied by a crunchy cheese and sausage toast and a sliver of pâté. The first courses we chose were appetizingly presented and simply delicious. I had a buratta on tomato carpaccio with the white cheese offering a nice foil to the tarty tomatoes. My main course was an aiguillette de canard topped by a generous slice of seared foie gras. I gave up on the dessert though my neigbour's plate looked tempting enough. The craving for something sweet at the end of the meal was satisfied with the mignardises offered by the house.

It was not a problem as there were a lot of choices for our non-carnivrous friends. It was a hot July evening and thankfully we were under parasols which the personnel folded when the sun had set making us enjoy the rather rustic and charming surroundings. The food was varied and delicious, well cooked and aesthetically presented. The ambiance was quite relaxed and easy with families in adjoining tables.

Unforgettable lunch in a beautiful village,"We had booked for a lunch that sunny August and sat under the wide parasols in the garden. We were with friends who had been there the week before and didn't hestitate to treat themselves again to another lunch. Service was pleasant, fast and the waitresses were quite fluent in both French and English. We all had different starters. I had a potato velouté that was surprising in texture, taste and temperature. My husband took medallions of New Zealand salmon while a friend had foie gras with amusing violet chips. Our main course was a veal dish (quasi de veau) paired with a tender cube of beef cheeks. All this served with a great red burgundy. I ended with a honey based dessert, learning later on that the chef's name is Nick Honeyman, thus the edible honeybee design on the plate. My husband enjoyed his red beetroot sorbet. We all went for a leisurely stroll along the banks for the Vézère river, admiring the beautifully symmetrical Romansque church of St Léon.

The plane seemed to fly with less noise. The usual offer of beds, excellent wines, good meals were still there but somehow I preferred the relatively smaller airplanes.

Came not for the sugar mill but for the Ossorio chapel,"To be honest, we were very faintly interested to see how sugar is manufactured in this huge industrial complex. An old crude artisan sugar mill would have piqued our imagination more. But we came for the chapel's murals painted in 1950 by the artist son of the owner of the Victorias Mills, Alfonso Ossorio. He was already well known in the vibrant art world in the US being associated and was the benefactor of struggling artst Jackson Pollock. The Ossorio altarpiece was painted with special pigments that could withstand tropical conditions and the colours are still vivid to this day. The altar is decorated with images of the Last Judgment. A looming figure of Christ, not the benevolent Christ but the stern judge extending His arms, is shown with the huge red hands of God the Father and the Holy Ghost is above. The iconography must have been controversial at that time. Pains were taken to ""Filipinize"" images showing Mary as a native Filipina, St Joseph the carpenter with the tools of his trade. Even the Roman soldiers in the stations of the Cross were Filipino soldiers. The Baptistry is interesting for its use of again local glass materials (from used bottles) to create mosaics in a structure recalling ancient baptismal fonts with a dug-out pool. There is a mural of the Last Supper on the back wall at the exterior of the chapel and like the mosaics, this is not Ossorio's creations. The chapel was designed by a Czech architect, again quite innovative at that time for its simplicity of lines, the architectural elements themselves serving as restrained decorations, the open spaces, the high ceiling and perforated upper walls adapted to tropical weather conditions. The chapel is a jewel that embodies art and religiosity on a truly elevated sphere. On the way out, we noticed the old wooden Victorias executives' homes which were reminiscent of colonial residences surrounded by lush gardens. Maybe next time, we'll visit the industrial complex but we were amply satiated by the ""Angry Christ"" chapel.",March 2019,Victorias Milling Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298463-d4894090-Reviews-Victorias_Milling_Company-Negros_Island_Visayas.html,"Negros Island, Philippines",attractions,5.0,4.0
ancestral home lives again,"Silay teems with large sugar estates where many hacienda homes can be found. Balay Negrese belongs to a family of French origin who had greatly prospered in Negros. This immense ancestral home, now a museum, gives us a glimpse of a privileged life in the 19th century. There are charming competent guides, Filipiniana dressed, who will take you through the large airy rooms. The wide planks of the floor still shines with the patina of the ages. An elegant horseshoe stairway conducts you to a breezy sala flanked by equally airy rooms on the sides. There is a kitchen with ""modern"" (for that time) appliances and a dirty kitchen as well that used wood and coal. Objects and furniture, we were told, had been donated by many Negrense families to make this house live again. Though their former opulence has now tarnished we can imagine the ease and luxury the residents of this estate home must have enjoyed.

"incredible wealth in the collections, historical information, fascinating temporary exhibit","No queues, no crowds in our early after lunch visit to the Ayala Museum. Reception at ticket booth was helpful and friendly. We started with the temporary exhibit of Mark Lewis Lim Higgins on the ground floor. It was a fascinating mixture of his paintings in an installation of some kind of rich warehouse, overflowing with silks, ceramics, gold and spices reminiscent of what were exported during the galleon trade. The muted atmosphere, the dim lights, the scent of incense and spices transported us to another time and place! Then we went up to the 4th floor to marvel at the gold collection: objects dug up mainly in Agusan and testimony to the extraordinary skill of local goldsmiths of the 10th - 13th centuries. The excellent ceramic collection of Roberto Villanueva held our attention for its scope, its richness and its beauty.

Then we shifted continents and had pan seared foie gras on toast. I went back to Japan by helping myself light tempura servings. My husband took the wine forfait so he could change wines as he changed dishes. For example a white Loire valley wine to go with the fish dishes, a red Spanish wine with the grilled lamb. An itinerant ice cream vendor closed my lunch for me with ube ice cream though the desserts bar had other flavours as well as fresh fruits. It was truly a gastronomic experience.

We were with friends who had a beautiful beach house in Punta Fuego and they had made reservations for a casita that overlooks the wide white crescent beach. The water gently sloped up to the limits of the safety barriers. The sand was fine and clean and thankfully hardly any plastic detritus was seen. The panoramic view from our casita was relaxing. Though there were young kids playing ball on the beach, their happy cries were not at all disturbing. Perhaps the levels and terraces helped to deflect the sound. There were dark blue swimming pools of varying depths but my husband preferred to swim in the sea. We had a typical delicious though not extraordinary Filipino lunch at the Cafe del Sol.

"tune in, turn off, leave your world","We visited Mount Purro Nature Reserve only for a day in order to look at the facilities available for a future family reunion. The Reserve is not too far from the city. There are wide cemented roads leading to the place while the landscape slowly becomes more rural, more provincial. Since we were looking for a relatively secluded and calm environment, we were not deceived. The reception ""hut"" starts the visitors off with a briefing, an orientation of the strongly ecological policies of the Reserve - the classic take only photos, leave only footprints, as well as this family-run enterprise's contribution to the economy by training and hiring local inhabitants.
We had lunch first before exploring the sites at Loli's Kitchen which is a common restaurant for all the guests. The food was basically Filipino: simple, honest, delicious, nostalgically home-cooked with ingredients coming mainly from the Reserve's organic garden. In fact everything was done to blend with a Filipino rural setting: thatched anahaw roofs, bamboo tables. The screened casitas where guests can stay overnight have beds on the floor but rest assured there are flush toilets and hot showers.There are no TVs except in the Game Room where one can play ping pong, pool, sungka. There are pavillions of different capacities which can be rented depending on the number of guests and can also avail of the Reserve's catering services. There are no loudspeakers broadcasting ""ambiance"" music. There is a swimming pool, a play ground for kids, a trampoline, a fire pit for roasting marshmallows or sausages. I was told that some evenings can be magical with fireflies. At Mount Purro Nature Reserve being at the foothills of the Sierra Madre mountains, the temperatures may be quite cool and refreshing. The native Dumagat tribemen also offer mountain hikes and demonstrations of their tribal skills.
Do not expect sleek and shiny resort facilities here. We go native. Do make an effort not to be cyber-connected. Instead tune in to the chirping of the birds and the rustle of the leaves.

It was a small exhibit (too many people though), not too many original works of the master but the exhibit placed him well in the Roman context. I particularly appreciated the Supper at Emmaus from the Hermitage (to compare with the same subject at the National Gallery in London) and the two Mary Magdalenes to easily seen as they are in private collections. The Museum has a whole floor of exquisite Italian paintings like that Paolo Uccello St George and the Dragon.

First of all the museum entrance is interesting with its concrete façade of seeingly random holes and some vegetation growing through them. From the modern entrance a narrow corridor brings one to an impressive cloistered courtyard. The corridor ceilings have graceful Gothic ribbings while the courtyard windows have rhythmic rounded arches. Upon entering the dim church are enormous works of art which I first thought to be bas reliefs. They are almost monochromatic paintings done by José Maria Sert (a discovery for me!) in homage to the Basque people: as navigators, merchants, shipbuilders, fishermen, blacksmiths, saints...Very monumental, impressive. We move on to another wing where there are funeral stelae. Again interesting explanatory text on the Basque concept of spirituality. Another wing deals with the Basque whaling industry in the past, models of ships, harpoons, etc. including an rich ethnographic collection. The top floor is devoted to paintings.

Intriguing Chillida sculptures on Gothic church site,"After having seen Chillida's Peine del Viento at the end of Ondarreta beach, we were overjoyed to discover he had more sculptures on display in the grounds of the oldest church in San Sebastian in the Old Town. Gigantic hands in tender but powerful gestures were just amazing and so striking. The Gothic church of San Vicente was equally interesting. Upon entering through the more Baroque entrance we found ourselves in a low vestibule above which was space for the choir and the organ. The Gothic ribbings served both to show the architectural structure as well as its decorative elements. The low vestibule space suddenly contrasts with the very high ribbed ceiling of the nave leading the eyes to the 5-levelled golden 16th century altar. An equally powerful Pieta may be seen on the right side of the nave.
