Amazing Experience,"When we decided to visit Maramures, we were looking for a place just like this one. A traditional wooden house. I really recommend choosing an accommodation like this one when visiting Maramures, rather than a modern hotel. It's part of the experience.
Our host was amazing and the best part was the food. Really recommend choosing to eat at ""La Gorgan"".
The rooms were clean, warm and traditionally decorated.
We will definitely return.",October 2020,Pensiunea La Gorgan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1030734-d9813004-Reviews-Pensiunea_La_Gorgan-Vadu_Izei_Maramures_County_Northwest_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Vadu Izei, Romania",hotels,5.0,4.5

Good food but bad service,"We went today for the first time at Tasaul. The place was recommended to us by a friend. We arrived at 14:00 ordered a starter and A main course. We were starving. The starter arrived in 40 minutes. It was good, but very small. After that we waited and waited for the main course. The food arrived at 16:00. They apologized by saying it is Sunday and the place in crowded but in the time that we sat and waited for the food, lots of people arrived, were served and were leaving, having same dishes as we did. We were a small table (only 2 people) and didnâ€™t order a lot.

Amazing Experience,"We went there in January. The weather was perfect. Not to hot, not to cold, but sunny.
There were not so many people, not so crowded.
You have to walk a little to get to the top but it's pleasant.
The view from there it's absolutely stunning.

I love that they are restoring it.",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Nice location but that's just about it.,"The idea is nice. The location in great. Right in the city center.
The service was just ok (we ordered grill chicken and they bought us fried chicken), the food, again, ok. Not amazing but good related to the prices.
Although, the chairs where incredibly dirty. At first i didn't want to sit there but i was really hungry and looking for a place to eat right away.
Everything is very poorly maintained",March 2019,Medieval Cafe Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g311309-d12452049-Reviews-Medieval_Cafe_Restaurant-Sighisoara_Mures_County_Central_Romania_Transylvania.html,"Sighisoara, Romania",restaurants,2.0,4.0

Amazing food but unprepared staff,"The atmosphere was great, the food was delicious, but the stuff was terrible. I called in advance because i wanted a place on the terrace and wanted to make a reservation. They told me that it's no need for a reservation on the terrace and that i should make a reservation if i want a table inside. When we got there, the restaurant was empty and the terrace was full, so i did caught a place upstairs, on the terrace.
Also on that day, their grill wasn't working so they couldn't make any dish from the menu that is prepared on grill, and that means like 50% of the them.
And i also spotted the bartender stirring the ingredients from my Mojito with his own finger",April 2018,Linea Closer to the Moon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294458-d12696896-Reviews-Linea_Closer_to_the_Moon-Bucharest.html,"Bucharest, Romania",restaurants,3.0,4.0

Very cozy but far from the city center,"The rooms were comfortable but unequipped. For example you do not have a fridge or a hair dryer. Our view was a bit terrible and the hotel is very far from the city center, like 45 minutes by tram. It is good that is located near the tram station. There are no restaurants near by, just a mc Donalds, a cafe ( where they have very nice food especially for breakfast) and a gas station.
