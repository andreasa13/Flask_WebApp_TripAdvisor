Nice sheltered location in the Plaka,"Chose this restaurant because of the menu which included fish. Nice location sheltered under trees and canopies in a square in the Plaka area, probably very busy in normal times but very quiet at the moment. Food was good standard Greek fare, waiters pleasant and good service.",September 2020,Acropol Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6833930-Reviews-Acropol_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Iconic site at the centre of the ancient world,The Acropolis is the centre of the ancient world and is still an amazing site with its impressive walls and containing the iconic Parthenon and other historical sites. Your approach up a series of ramps and steps to the main entrance with its partially restored Propylaea gives a sense of its importance. The Parthenon is the main attraction and is being systematically restored which means there are building works and scaffolding on parts of the structure. The Temple of Athena Nike and the Erechtheum are the other main extant buildings worthy of a visit. Fantastic views right across the city in all directions from the walls. Several sites around the slopes of the hill such as the two theatres are also worth a look. With the current restrictions there is a marked route around the Acropolis with marshals to guide you but with lower visitor numbers and no crowding this gives good separation and excellent views of all the monuments so this was a great time to visit.,September 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
World-famous iconic building still under reconstruction,"A unique and must-see location at one of the world's most iconic sites. Great to see this amazing building up-close (although you cannot touch or go in the building). It is still a building site after 2,500 years but the restoration work is impeccable and the columns in the north façade are now all in place. Views of the south façade are restricted by informative hoardings. A route has been established around the building to keep social distancing with wardens to enforce it, but at the moment there are very few visitors so no crowds and excellent views to be had of all the buildings on the Acropolis.",September 2020,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent Location for a city break,"Hapimag Resort Athens is located in the Plaka area which is a great central location for easy access to the main sites and tourist attractions. It is in a quiet street within easy reach of local restaurants, tavernas and shops. It is also well located for the main transport links although a taxi to the door is probably the easiest option if you have a lot of luggage.

The resort is small and consists of a few apartments with a reception area and limited facilities although it does have an excellent roof terrace with seating and direct views of the Acropolis which is great for breakfast or an evening drink.

Apartments are neat and well-furnished and are kept clean and in excellent condition. Small kitchenette area with hob and oven and cooking utensils sufficient for breakfast and basic self-catering. There is a coffee machine and a kettle and a microwave available if required.

No parking, but altogether very handy for a city break or a stopover.",September 2020,Hapimag Resort Athene,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d657532-Reviews-Hapimag_Resort_Athene-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Lovely bistro in quiet setting with quality local food,"This unassuming but well presented bistro has only a few tables but manages an excellent cuisine and service. Located on a pleasant square with trees although there is occasional passing traffic. Very polite, attentive and immaculate waiter manages well in English. Food is delicious and we had to come back for a second visit which was just as good as the first. Try the starters as well.",August 2019,Bistro Del Parque,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187439-d13950854-Reviews-Bistro_Del_Parque-Marbella_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html,"Marbella, Spain",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Quality food in excellent setting,Lovely location on quiet terrace overlooking the sea and above the promenade. Good quality local food on limited menu with occasional specials.

Superb position and excellent quality resort,"A beautiful resort consisting of serviced apartments and communal facilities for members and guests. Outdoor pool, restaurant, bodega, wellness, café, shop, indoor and outdoor seating areas, meeting room. Various sized rooms with large balconies. An excellent location right on the seafront but within walking distance of the old town. Lots of restaurants and shops within an easy walk. A very relaxing atmosphere at this resort and helpful staff made this two-week stay a complete pleasure.",August 2019,Hapimag Resort Marbella,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187439-d3357875-Reviews-Hapimag_Resort_Marbella-Marbella_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html,"Marbella, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.5
Good facilities in immature setting,"We booked a last minute long weekend away so we could cool off in the pool in the hot weather. Unfortunately the weather turned wet and windy on the Friday of our arrival and cleared up on the Monday of our departure.
Arrival and check-in was very smooth and pleasant. We were impressed with the woodland lodge (modern, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, dishwasher and microwave, 2 TVs) but disappointed with the standard of cleaning and had to call up to ask for this to rectified, which is was promptly but only partially to our satisfaction. However the setting of the lodges is along tarmac'ed roads and they don't feel like they are in the woods although they are amongst pine trees. This may improve over time as the evident tree planting develops and matures.

The 'sub-tropical swimming paradise' was disappointing. It is smaller than we expected (compared to other resorts) especially the main wave pool. There are no adult chill-out zones such as hot tubs, Jacuzzis or sun lamps (like there are at De Eemhof) and the 'sub-tropical' décor is bland.

There are good areas for younger children but not much for older ones; the chutes and slides are all a bit extreme for them,.but It was warm. the 'lazy river' was fun and the kids enjoyed the rapids (where you go outside the dome) immensely.Food service at the three restaurants we used was excellent - Hucks for American / Texmex food was better than expected; Strada was good but expensive Italian, and the portions in The Pancake House were large (you don't need a starter) and all had reasonable childrens' menus. The only thing I would say is that they all very noisy - lots of hard surfaces, loud music, lots of clatter and chatter, so don't go for a relaxing or romantic meal.

We hired bikes which were in excellent working order and very enjoyable to ride around - although the site is NOT flat and it's hard work in places - but £15 to hire 3 helmets for a day seems a bit much. We also tried the Segway Experience - congratulations to Seqway Steph for making this a fun and enjoyable experience learning to drive them especially round the obstacle course in the woods.

The site is quite extensive and hilly and you need to be prepared to walk or cycle a lot to get around. Altogether a worthwhile weekend away but the Woburn site would probably not be my first choice for a return visit.",July 2018,Center Parcs Woburn Forest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190737-d6117690-Reviews-Center_Parcs_Woburn_Forest-Bedford_Bedfordshire_England.html,"Bedford, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
