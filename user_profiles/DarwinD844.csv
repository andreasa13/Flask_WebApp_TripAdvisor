Vacationing like a king,"We vacationed different times in the past and we love all inclusive resorts and this was one of the best experiences we ever had.
What was good? Every thing, the rooms cleaned every day, the food ok ( We couldn't ask more for what we paid, The Rodizio restaurant was the best). We stayed in a room with view to the beach and the pools . I could see every morning maintenance guys cleaning the pool. To all the staff and entertainers, Great job!.

We definitely will be back in the future.

Travel considerations;
We came from Fort Lauderdale with Spirit Airlines , good price if you buy ahead of time, the only issue but not a problem the flight arrives in Santiago de Los caballeros which is 1 hour from airport. We paid 80 dollars for a cab. We used the same one to come back. As per the resort we booked through Expedia ,real good price for 6 nights. Book ahead also you can find good prices,we heard about Group on from some guests.

We feel we really had vacation!",October 2012,Cofresi Palm Beach & Spa Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147290-d218484-Reviews-Cofresi_Palm_Beach_Spa_Resort-Puerto_Plata_Puerto_Plata_Province_Dominican_Republic.html,Dominican Republic,hotels,5.0,4.0
