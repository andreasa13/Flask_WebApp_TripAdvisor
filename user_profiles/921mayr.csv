Convenient way Of seeing the city!,"Our driver arrived ahead of time on the day of the tour and took us to our first destination the Acropolis. We arrived before the other tours so we’re easily able to get tickets from the site and explore. He waited for us to finished and we went to Zeus temple next. I would recommend purchasing the 30 euro multiple entry ticket as a fast means of entering the other sites and wearing comfortable shoes as the climb in the Acropolis is extremely slippery.
Lunch was delicious, it was a recommendation from our driver. He was also incredibly knowledgeable of all the sites we were visiting.
I would recommend this tour for those who are pressed with time and would like to cover all of the sites in Athens within a day.
For those staying in the plaka area already, the Acropolis and Acropolis museum is all within walking distance. Also no need to purchase fast track tickets as it is not crowded",February 2020,Athens Full Day Private Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d13330909-Athens_Full_Day_Private_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,4.0,5.0
"Plaka, also known as “the city of Gods”","Plaka, one of the oldest neighborhoods in Greece located directly underneath the Acropolis and is literally walking distance from this must see touristic attraction. The Acropolis museum is also nearby and is also within walking distance. The view of the Acropolis at night is even better than during the day since it lights up.
This beautiful neighborhood is filled with tourists and is lively all day being filled with taverns and shops Selling everything from olives, olive wood products, souvenirs and authentic Greek food. Nearly all corners and ally ways have something new to see.
Be careful though, there are Gypsies and beggars nearly on every corner so I would recommend placing valuables in a safe back in the hotel and guarding belonging close to you.
Some taxis also don’t drop directly within plaka since the roads are incredibly tight and it is nearly always busy there. Just a note, for those using the taxis, if they refuse to drop you to the location you ask it is illegal and you could tell the police since all taxis drivers are obliged by law to drop you to your required destination (just a note since we were refused by a taxi driver and a local friend told us)",February 2020,Plaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d277449-Reviews-Plaka-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
serene Country side and venician inspired architecture,"We were greeted by our lovely tour guide and now dear friend Tom. He came half an hour early and was incredibly patient with our young kids, who were incredibly excited and somewhat loud. We made our way to our first stop which was the Cornith canal which happened to be on the way to Mycenae. I would not recommend the canal for people who are afraid of heights as you have to walk on a metal bridge with no support underneath. With that said the blue waters underneath were incredibly beautiful and it’s amazing to see how deep the canal was actually dug out. They do offer bunjee jumping for those who don’t have the faint of hearts, if you’re interested.
Mycenae is situated on a hill within the country side. As beautiful as the surrounding were the best part was honestly the gate and entry way. It was thought that cyclops had helped Perseus built it. On the entry way there are two lions, hence the name “lions gate”. I would recommend climbing all the way to the top to take a picture of the surroundings. And making your way out to head to Nafplios.
Nafplios, is a fortress located high on the top of a mountain. There are two ways to get to the top, by walking 100 or so steps or by car. I recommend taking the car for those who are not in the best of shape. Out of all the sites, this was by far my favorite. You get to see the beautiful view of the ocean and venetian inspired buildings underneath. It is also well kept and not in ruins so you get to see the whole structure as it was back then. This was one of the many highlights of our trip.
The last stop, epidarus, was an Ancient Greek theatre that believe it or not is still in use today. Stand in the middle and take a video as if you’re performing for a large audience. On site there’s also a small Museum and a place to buy refreshments for those who get thirsty.
There are toilets in nearly all the attractions that are clean so no need to worry.
Also the private tours offer water when you book them and nearly all the guides are well educated about the history of the places you’re visiting.
If you have a chance, ask for Tom. He made our visit extra special! Such a genuine person who truly loves what he does..along the way, he took us on small detours . We stopped at an antique store that offer pottery classes for those who are interested and gave us delicious oranges for free and also let us see their private museum that wasn’t opened to the public yet. We also got to eat some authentic Greek food next to a beautiful lake.
Ask for Tom and you won’t regret it, trust me!",February 2020,"Mycenae, Epidaurus, Nafplio full day private tour from Athens",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d16753589-Mycenae_Epidaurus_Nafplio_full_day_private_tour_from_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,4.0,5.0
Picturesque view of the city. A must see!,"the Acropolis and acropolis museum are walking distance from plaka, sitting high up on a mountain in the middle of the city, this beautiful monument is a must see if you’re ever in Athens, even for a day. When traveling in February and March there is no need to book online skip the line tickets as it’s not so busy especially if you went early morning. The attraction opens up at 8:30 in the morning. And if you need a guide you can hire a lovely lady on spot at the attraction site. (Although she did ask for the hefty sum of 100 euros). We ended up getting the 30 euro tickets that included entry to multiple touristic attractions within the city, with the exception of the Athens museum and the Olympic stadium. I would highly recommend purchasing it if you’re doing the one day Athens tour.
At the top, the view of Athens is breath taking and you can even catch a glimpse of the temple of Zeus below.
I would highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes that have good grip on the ground as the steps are incredibly slippery since they are made out of marble. If with kids, pay extra attention as no fence around the edge.
There are security guards everywhere though.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Beautiful country, wonderful people and overall great tour (highly recommend)","We started our journey being greeted at our door by Mr Tom (our tour guide and wonderful driver). He came half an hour ahead of time, which we appreciated. He was friendly and extremely patient with our kids. Our first stop was Corinth canals, which offered bunje jumping for whoever is interest. Along the way Mr Tom allowed us to stop and grab some oranges from a local vendor. We took several detours along the way that were completely worth it. Our overall favorite site was Nafplios the view was incredible, the highlight of our tour.

Definite room for improvement,"On the positive side, the location of the hotel is amazing being close to the metro, bars, restaurants and shops. The staff were all welcoming and accommodating and were always going out of their way for our comfort.
The rooms style, however, is a bit outdated it could be modernizedand the television could include more channels for both kids and adults.
The baby sitting service was great but unfortunately not available during the morning and early afternoon., maybe that could be looked at. The nanny my kids had was wonderful and my kids liked her. The breakfast was a nuisance ...having to wait and the over crowded room with the same selection of food and cereals...could be changed or maybe expanded.",July 2018,Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294265-d306178-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Singapore_Orchard_City_Centre-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",hotels,3.0,4.5
