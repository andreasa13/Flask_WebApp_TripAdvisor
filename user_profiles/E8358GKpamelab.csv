Very good,"I always use Easyjet when I can. I find their prices very reasonable, the staff most polite an helpful. The main problem I have is the the information systems in the smaller airports I cannot make out what they are saying as they speak so quickly in what ever language so I end up following the crowd!! I know I am getting on in years but I have spoken to other passengers younger than myself and they have the same problem.That I am happy to say is my only complaint.I always recommend Easyjet to other travellers .",October 2019,easyJet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729066-Reviews-EasyJet,World,flights,5.0,3.5
Acropolis,"I recently spent 6 days in lovely Athens, the main reason I went was to visit the Acropolis and I was not disappointed We arrived at night and when I went on the veranda and right in front of me on a hill was the illuminated Acropolis it took my breath away, I was determined to visit the sight although I am frightened of heights!It was marvellous the viewing was well organized with everybody able to examine the Temples without a crush.I thoroughly recommend a visit.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Wonderful Athens,"My friend and I rented an apartment through Home and Away booking agency The apartment was attached to the Acropolis Ami Boutique Hotel. The apartment was well furnished and clean the staff very helpful, and as advertised it looked over the Acropolis. We found the city of Athens was all we had hoped for. Pleasure open top buses were frequent going to all of the interesting sites and you could hop and of the buses as the ticket lasts for 24 hours The restaurants were reasonable priced and plenty of them.One thing I should mention is Athens has many steep hills so good sensible shoes essential !!! Our holiday experience was great and would recommend our city visit.",October 2019,Acropolis Ami Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d1197866-Reviews-Acropolis_Ami_Boutique_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Journey on a Steam train,"I took my granddaughters on a trip from Tenterden to Bodian on the steam locomotive I had not been on one for at least 50yrs and it was well worth the wait. Whilst on the train we were given information of the surrounding beautiful countryside, it was very interesting historically. We arrived at Bodian Castle with enough time to walk around the ruins and have a drink. We then caught the train back. My Granddaughter thoroughly enjoyed the experience and a good time was had bt all.",October 2018,Kent & East Sussex Railway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g503919-d261283-Reviews-Kent_East_Sussex_Railway-Tenterden_Kent_England.html,"Tenterden, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
