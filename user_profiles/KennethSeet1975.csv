Awful flight to Grand Rapids,Flew United from Newark to Grand Rapids and I was ushered back in time to their emb 145 aircraft. It was a step back in time and it was not one bit quaint.

Resort Fees,Stayed at this property right in the heart of Times Square. Location is convenient and rooms are good size. One bugbear for this hotel is they charge a resort fee irregardless if you use or need the list of perks they offer. I was rudely shocked when I was told about these fees! This fee was not told to me either at time of booking or at time of check in.
