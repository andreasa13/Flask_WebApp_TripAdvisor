Sound of the waves helps the appetite,We had several meals [and drinks] at Mariners and found the service to be good and the meals tasty and good value. Pretty standard beach front menu. I would recommend their Prawn Curry. The real attraction of Mainers is the relaxed ambiance one only finds on the beach.,November 2020,Mariners Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1755057-d1755058-Reviews-Mariners_Restaurant-Marina_Beach_KwaZulu_Natal.html,"Marina Beach, South Africa",restaurants,4.0,4.0
not up to expectations,"We had noticed the lodge on several occasions and decided to stop over on our way back from the coast. First impression was good but the so called luxury two bedroom cottage did not live up to expectation. Rooms are cramped but a large bathroom. Unfortunately the shower was below standard. Not good value for the money.
The Bar has some unique wood features and the barman was helpful. Unfortunately the bar stools are extremely uncomfortable. Nice vibe overall.
We had dinner, my wife having the Chicken Pie while I had the Eisbein. Both were really very good.
It was raining at the time and the walk back to the Rondavel was unpleasant. Very poor lighting and we came close to falling on the uneven surface.
Unfortunately the noise from the N3 is very intrusive.",November 2020,Lala Nathi Country Guesthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g661422-d660861-Reviews-Lala_Nathi_Country_Guesthouse-Harrismith_Free_State.html,"Harrismith, South Africa",hotels,3.0,4.5
Not your usual Eisbein.,"We were a group of four for dinner. Setting overlooking the lagoon created a peaceful relaxed ambiance. All meals were perfectly prepared but I must make special mention of their Eisbein. Now, forget anything you know about traditional German style Eisbein because this was something special.
It was as if the Chef was given a challenge to prepare the Pork Shank in a unique way tossing aside the recipe book.
Its hard to describe but it was prepared in much the way one would slow roast a lamb shank; soft, delicious with unique herbs and spices yet retaining the crisp crackling.
Superb interpretation of a popular dish.",November 2020,Lagoon Resaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1441360-d22774235-Reviews-Lagoon_Resaurant-Southbroom_Margate_KwaZulu_Natal.html,"Southbroom, South Africa",restaurants,4.0,3.0

These are 'wild' animals; not a Zoo.,"Sadly the tar roads have deteriorated even further with some rather deep potholes that could immobilise a vehicle. Overall still a wonderful wild life experience. Driver/tourist education really does need serious attention especially when it comes to blocking both sides of the road and not leaving escape routes; we are dealing with dangerous animals. At one stage a Rhino and her calf felt threatened by the cars surrounding her and she reacted by ramming our car.
It's hard to describe how powerful these creatures are and if she had not been dehorned we would have been in serious trouble.",October 2020,Pilanesberg National Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312652-d2561640-Reviews-Pilanesberg_National_Park-Sun_City_Moses_Kotane_Local_Municipality_North_West_Pro.html,"Sun City, South Africa",attractions,4.0,4.5
such a pity that Covid has put a damper on things..,"We arrive a little early and because of Covid regulations had to have drinks at the pool area while waiting to be seated.

Supposed to be 'the' eatery at Sun City Hotel,"We were a party of four during the week. We had booked but found the place was only partially full. Initial service was inexplicably on the slow side and we had to wait for drinks to arrive. Two ordered the half chicken peri-peri with a side of vegetables. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy and the vegetables done to perfection.
The order of oxtail was a bad mistake. Served without any form of gravy , dry and not adequately cooked.
The lamb curry, while really tasty, had too many poorly cut pieces of meat with sharp edges. I eventually caught the attention of the waiter and explained that the rice was cold. I was told ""oh, I'll tell the chef"".
We tried ordering more drinks and finally gave up and asked for the bill. It took nearly thirty minutes and arrived as we were about to walk out.

What Pilgrim's Rest used to be....,"Haenertsburg is a tiny village close to Magoebaskloof lined with several eateries and curio shops. There are a number of old wood and iron mine houses that can be rented. Unlike Pilgrims Rest you are not harassed by 'car guards' so strolling around the village is pleasant. The Iron Crown Pub was our choice as they serve a good craft beer called Zwakala. They serve some quite exotic Burgers and the smell of the curries being eaten at a nearby table had me salivating.

Magnificent setting,"The Hotel is one of those strange establishments we find hidden in out of the way places in South Africa. Old world charm, great pub, stunning views. We spent three days relaxing and visiting the area and could not have chosen a better place. Staff are old school, polite, attentive and genuinely proud of their Hotel.
It does have some faults. Bedrooms, while comfortable and clean, do need upgrading. Towels are past their sell by date.
Menu is good but a bit pretentious. The manager, Jayden, went out of his way to ensure that our stay was enjoyable and promptly attended to the few minor hitches we encountered.

Old style country hotel,The Hotel is old and it shows; but that's part of its attraction. The Pub has the right welcoming feel as has the dining room. We have eaten there many times over the years and were disappointed on this occasion but hopefully this this was an aberration. The regular travelers who use the hotel as their pit-stop have created a unique atmosphere and the donkey that visits the Pub in the evening is a great focal point.

Probably the best in Port Edward,"We ate there on two occasions and were impressed by the general 'feel' of the place and the good service. They have a Pub area, a dining area and an outside area with a wood fired Pizza oven. Food was good and inexpensive by City standards. Lamb curry was enjoyable but one of the peri-peri liver starters was a let down as it had a curry base. We had only one gripe and that was because the Pub area [which I favoured] allowed smoking. I queried this but it appears that smoking is condoned by management.",February 2020,Spuds Pub & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g950941-d14149459-Reviews-Spuds_Pub_Grill-Port_Edward_KwaZulu_Natal.html,"Port Edward, South Africa",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Grubby offset by excellent service,"Pub that is clearly popular with the locals and an outside deck with a view. The young man who served us was really very good; attentive and helpful. I'm sorry I can't remember his name. Food is traditional ""pub"" style with generous portions. It's just a pity that their house-keeping is not up to standard.

Wish there was a rating for 'Good',"We enjoyed our visit and definitely would rate it as being 'good' but not deserving of ""very good'. The upper deck requires placing drinks orders at the Bar so service can't really be rated. Good crowd and a pleasant family vibe. Meals are served on the deck but after a few drinks we opted to eat downstairs. The toilet facilities on the deck need sprucing up.

Deck with views of the beach,Nice setting and while the place was not full it had a pleasant vibe. The food being served at around our table looked good and seemed to be well received by the patrons. That's the good side. We finally attracted the attention of one of the many waiters and asked for menus and drinks and were told that 'our' waiter would be with us shortly. And so it went. Service was abysmal and what should have been a pleasant lunch time turned into a disaster.

Deserving of its 5* rating.,"we had a private suite with its own swimming pool. Absolutely stunning, immaculate, accommodation and idyllic views of the Mediterranean from your patio. Nothing better than a few drinks while soaking in the view.
The Resort is large so you will be faced with some walks not suited to the unfit. The place is very popular with Germans so expect to hear more German than Greek! The food, while served in a buffet format, is exceptionally good and varied.
We used the 'all inclusive' package and were more than satisfied with the overall deal. There is a private beach and a large pool area for the sun worshipers.
The manager, Giongos Grivas is efficient, polite and very hands on and while all the staff are really good I must single out Ewa on reception, Stamatis at the pool bar and Savvas at the bottom bar.

ONE OF THOSE TRICKY ONES..,"The hotel isl situated inside a market so access is slightly awkward but certainly not a problem as some travelers have said. Clean, reasonably sized rooms, comfortable beds. Why do so many hotels persist in having small baths when a good sized shower is so much better? Good breakfast and while they do not serve other meals there are numerous eateries within the market area. The roof bar has spectacular views of the Acropolis but expect to pay higher prices for your drinks.
We travel for experiences so opted for a room overlooking the market. Incredible sights of public hard drug usage but did not impact on our safety. Wonderful fresh meat/fish market a quick walk away with great fresh sea food bistros at reasonable prices.

if you have a soul...,You have to visit the Owl House. Nieu-Bethesda is one of the many places ignored by South Africans who are in too much of a hurry to get to their destination. It's out of the way but truly worth the effort. You need to take time to read the letters and documents relating to her tragic life. The statues will touch every emotion and one clearly feels that their creation is the result of a deep spiritual union between her and Malgas and the others who shared her vision.,September 2018,The Owl House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1636600-d4243484-Reviews-The_Owl_House-Nieu_Bethesda_Eastern_Cape.html,"Nieu-Bethesda, South Africa",attractions,5.0,4.5
Don't listen to the snobs; try it!,"Situated at the mouth of the Kowie river with a large large inside dining area and Deck overlooking the river and sea. Really good service on every occassion. Guido's offers good value and large portions of good food with no pretense.
Relaxing atmosphere and charming waitresses.",September 2018,Guido's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g953995-d5944223-Reviews-Guido_s-Port_Alfred_Eastern_Cape.html,"Port Alfred, South Africa",restaurants,4.0,3.0
A must try..,parking is a little limited so I'd suggest you get there early. Very welcoming staff and really personal attentive service. Food was very good as only happens when you have a hands on Chef.

Historic old building,"we passed during the day and asked if we needed to book for an early dinner. We were told yes but in fact the place was rather empty when we arrived. Interesting history so worth looking at the information on display. Drinks service was tardy.
Food was served and was rather average with the 'steak and beer' pie in particular being very salty. Perhaps we'll be luckier on another night.",September 2018,The Wharf Street Brew Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g953995-d2469326-Reviews-The_Wharf_Street_Brew_Pub-Port_Alfred_Eastern_Cape.html,"Port Alfred, South Africa",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Established in 1832,"The Pub has that wonderful 'aura' that only comes with time. If you are in to chrome and glass, well, it's not for you. Very friendly staff, exceptionally good prices and great home style food is what it takes to stay in business for over a 180 years. Highly recommended. Try their Ben Koppen draught beer.",September 2018,The Historic Pig & Whistle Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g675707-d2048967-Reviews-The_Historic_Pig_Whistle_Hotel-Bathurst_Eastern_Cape.html,"Bathurst, South Africa",hotels,5.0,4.5
The perfect Hogsback experience..,"We all have a mental picture of the area and the Kings's Lodge fits the image. Old fashioned charm and appeal. No fancy frills just warmth and good service. Vuyo in the kitchen and Zola in the pub are assets to the establishment. Fire place, cold beers and pleasant company while it snowed outside!",September 2018,The King's Lodge Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1235419-d1553290-Reviews-The_King_s_Lodge_Hotel-Hogsback_Eastern_Cape.html,"Hogsback, South Africa",hotels,4.0,4.0
Outstanding.,"Graaf -Reinet is the type of Town we have all driven through without stopping. Next time do yourself a favour and stay over at the Drostdy. There are not too many overseas hotels that can match their standards. No expense has been spared and it shows. Every effort has been made to create and retain the old Karoo character and even just walking around the hotel precinct is a sensory delight.
Take a walk around the area if you enjoy architecture. The Valley of Desolation is a short drive away and worth visiting. No wonder we love our country!",September 2018,Drostdy Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g317079-d10454070-Reviews-Drostdy_Hotel-Graaff_Reinet_Eastern_Cape.html,"Graaff-Reinet, South Africa",restaurants,5.0,4.5
off the beaten track..,and not well sign posted. Very rustic; I really liked the double bed suspended like a hammock in the back garden. The beers are good so what more could you want?

A Jekyll and Hyde experience,"We selected this hotel in the belief that it's tie in with the Hotel school would ensure good service. Hotel itself is in a beautiful setting on the banks of the Kowie river. Reception area, general decor and cleanliness are certainly up to its 4* rating. The staff [Trainees] are polite, well groomed and helpful.
I can only make an asumption but my gut feeling is that the instructors have current problems and are just going through the motions. How else can you explain the following?
Asked for a beer at the Pub and was told they had no glasses 'because the students break them'!
A glass was located but was hot to the touch. Was offered a wine glass.
My wife ordered a pot of tea and was told they served Rooibos ' because they did not keep Five Roses'
Was served meals on chipped crockery.
A student suggested my wife try their cake and when she accepted was told 'it's out of stock'
It took three days before someone in the kitchen was able to fry eggs to my satisfaction.
The list goes on and on numerous occassions we asked for the intervention of a Manager.
This never happened.
I must repeat that, generally, the students were most pleasant and helpful and were let down by management.",September 2018,MyPond Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g953995-d1458207-Reviews-MyPond_Hotel-Port_Alfred_Eastern_Cape.html,"Port Alfred, South Africa",hotels,3.0,4.5
NEVER FAILS....,"consistently good. Well prepared food and really pleasant and helpful staff. Try their lamb Curry; they have captured the unique ""Durban"" taste.

still below par,"Attractive decor with an interesting Deli incorporated into the entrance area. Good choice of imported and craft beers. That's the good news..
Eisbein [remember this is a German eatery] was cooked to a frazzle. The crackling, described as 'crisp', was black and inedible. Meat was dry. The sauerkraut was tasty but the vegetables could best be described as boarding school fare.
The German style Meatballs were tasty but also served with the overcooked vegetables. I asked that the Chef be made aware of my comments and received the Bill within seconds!",July 2018,Roter Hahn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g734479-d2417734-Reviews-Roter_Hahn-Clarens_Free_State.html,"Clarens, South Africa",restaurants,2.0,3.5
SAME PROBLEMS AS THE OTHERS..,I think all airlines are much of a muchness but there is one aspect that can be sorted out and that is the problem with hand luggage.

overwhelming colours..,"the wholesale market is huge and the masses of flowers on display overwhelm the senses. Walking through the crowded alleyways is an experience in itself. Don't get lost!

ORGANISED CHAOS,The open air laundry is normally viewed from the bridge but I'd recommend that you visit with a professional guide. It is mind blowing to see thousands [and thousands] of pieces of laundry being processed and emerging at the other end back with their owners. Our guide showed us the 'spin drying' areas [manual] and explained the codes used to mark the items. Many of the hotels and hospitals still use the laundry. The workers-men- work and live within the laundry confines and there is even a school.
