Great restaurant,"During our 2 weeks in Croatia we came to this place 2 times.Location is great,not to far from Riva but far enough from big crowds and noise. Considering Covid-19 situation,very easy to get a table outside and with the distance(remember Split could be very busy).Food was great,first time we had grill meats plata for 2 and risotto with shrimps, delicious .Service a bit slow but still it was worth a wait.Price was good considering quality and variety (all Split restaurants around Riva/center are overpriced)",September 2020,Trattoria Tinel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295370-d3420083-Reviews-Trattoria_Tinel-Split_Split_Dalmatia_County_Dalmatia.html,"Split, Croatia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great service,"Our ferry service from Hvar to Split was excellent. It was the last one to Split that evening.Krilo Ferry had more time choices then Jadrolinija even though ,we took Jadrolinija from Split to Hvar.Very simple and easy booking on line.For both of these ferry companies you need to be careful when in Split to really check where does the boat depart as it could be confusing (even if you speak Croatian :).Its good to know the name of the catamaran and come a bit earlier .",September 2020,Krilo Ferry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2034431-d8744085-Reviews-Krilo_Ferry-Krilo_Jesenice_Split_Dalmatia_County_Dalmatia.html,"Krilo Jesenice, Croatia",attractions,4.0,3.5
Great takeaway,"Even though it has few tables and chairs outside,it's more takeaway place.We really wanted to eat cevapcici,so it was the best place to try original version -with lepinja,type of flat bread and ajvar).In restaurants usually you will get it with fries. Anyhow, price was right,service great,and food delicious.",August 2020,Big Bang fast food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g303808-d12483752-Reviews-Big_Bang_fast_food-Hvar_Hvar_Island_Split_Dalmatia_County_Dalmatia.html,"Hvar Island, Croatia",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Acropolis private evening tour,"We met our guide Eva Vrontinaki( licensed Acropolis guide ) at the Acropoli metro station and had good, 2 hours of excellent tour of this amazing, historical site.(we already got our tickets on line ,so it was very easy to get in and of course,its mid October and early evening ,4pm)Tour was easy to follow and fun to learn with her interesting approach of stories with historical facts mixed with mythological bits and fun facts. Affordable ,considering it was only 3 in our group(kid 11y.old),easy to communicate and really fun . Definitely recommend to get a guide for Acropolis as not much explanation at the site.
