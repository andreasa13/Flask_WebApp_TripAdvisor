Beautiful in November,"Staying in the King George, we ended our nights here several times. It’s one of the nicest places in the city, but you can feel comfortable wearing casual clothes. Although the entrees and apps tended to be pricey, the view is unmatched as well as the atmosphere. It was most beautiful our first night when they had the Acropolis lit up in blue. The staff were amazingly friendly and really added to our experience by telling us all about local life and giving advice on what to see. Make sure to visit the lobby bar at Grande Bretagne as well- it has won many awards for best bar and is stunning- from the 17th century hand woven tapestry behind the bar, to their wonderful tea service.",November 2019,GB Roof Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1048185-Reviews-GB_Roof_Garden-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Hiking Up to the Acropolis,This is the number one site-seeing event with Athens built around it. We waited until the end of our trip to make the slow climb up the hill to see the Acropolis and Parthenon. The sites were well documented and we had some nice insight into the area from our bike tour at the beginning of our trip. The arena was very impressive. The best part was going in November when the weather was beautiful (60s) and the admission is half price (10 EU) with little in the way of lines. The Acroplid seemed to have its own set of feral cats and dogs to greet you.,November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Beautiful way to see Athens,"We had a wonderful time touring Athens on good bicycles with Sapfo Tabouti. She showed us the monuments, historical sites and churches while giving us a local’s point of view of her great city. We ended the tour with a ride through the park, a visit with the guards and a peek at the Olympic stadium. After the tour Sapfo gave us water and made sure everyone had plans for lunch and for future sightseeing. It was a great morning!",November 2019,Athens by Bike,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d1783079-Reviews-Athens_by_Bike-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Still Craving Mrs. Wilkes Country Food,Our only opportunity on our trip to eat at Ms. Wilkes was the Friday after Thanksgiving since they were close on Thanksgiving and on weekends. We made sure we got in line at 9am for the 11am opening and although it was very cold that morning - it was completely worth it. We had the first table with 11 of us and we enjoyed the amazing food and experience from the quick prayer to the mounds of southern cooking. Every bowl was sooo good and I couldn't stop eating the Fried Chicken. This place gets 5 yums. It reminds me of Miss Bobo's in Lynchburg Tennessee - fantastic!,November 2018,Mrs. Wilkes Dining Room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60814-d436974-Reviews-Mrs_Wilkes_Dining_Room-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Afraid to go to Sleep!,My family went on the walking Ghost tour with TC on Friday night from 9:30 - 11:30 after a Riverboat Cruise. I definitely would not recommend the Riverboat - but we had the greatest time on TC's ghost tour even though it poured rain the entire tour. He interacted really well with my whole family and he had us all listening intently to his stories. We give him an A+!!!!,November 2018,Genteel and Bard's Savannah Dark History and Ghost Walking Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g60814-d11990522-Genteel_and_Bard_s_Savannah_Dark_History_and_Ghost_Walking_Tour-Savannah_Georgia.html,"Savannah, Georgia",activities,5.0,5.0
A Beautiful Summer Night,"We thoroughly enjoyed dining out on the garden deck. The service was good, the rack of lamb was excellent and the atmosphere was like being on French Riviera with a cool breeze and beautiful foliage around us. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",September 2018,La Grillade Gourmande,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187136-d2167640-Reviews-La_Grillade_Gourmande-Epernay_Marne_Grand_Est.html,"Epernay, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Unmatched Views across Laxey Beaches,"We stayed a whole week at Seascape over the end of June/beginning of July. We knew we wanted to vacation on Isle of Man, but weren't sure where to stay. After researching for a month to try to find the best place available on the Island, we chose Seascape and we were not disappointed. We stayed in two bedrooms on the third floor that had sweeping views of the beaches below on both sides. The bathrooms were large with showers and soaking tubs and the rooms were bright white and lovely. The first full day was my birthday so we relaxed and had a spa day with Swedish massages, relaxing in the jacuzzi that looked out over the water and were fed a feast for lunch. Michelle even accommodated my sons who are picky eaters by bringing in special food just for them. It was a great day. After that we did tours of the island and Michelle helped us with reservation each night . A really cool aspect of the house is that it has a train station ""Fairy Cottage"" very close to it, so once you get your train ticket (for the day or multiple days), it's easy to jump on or off at that stop. Douglas is only a 8-10 minute drive and we would go for runs there most mornings - which was perfect along the sea wall with the distance marked. Afterward, Seascape would have breakfast set up for us with croissants, cereals, granola and yogurt and a wonderful English breakfast if you wanted to indulge. I highly recommend making your trip special by staying at SeaScape!",June 2018,Seascape,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1644859-d12360514-Reviews-Seascape-Laxey_Isle_of_Man.html,"Isle of Man, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
3 Michelin Star Restaurant,"This is excellence in dining. I was there with one of my client who runs an extremely progressive restaurant chain in the US and he was blown away. I had the chef's choice courses and there was barely room for dessert, but impossible not to eat it - it looked like a lemon, but was a lemon meringue pie- it was insanely good! Every course, every sauce, every meat - cooked to perfection. When I found out they had a relationship with Krug Champagnes it all made sense. Only the best. I'll be back with my next customer in September!",June 2018,L'Assiette Champenoise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g207343-d811219-Reviews-L_Assiette_Champenoise-Tinqueux_Reims_Marne_Grand_Est.html,"Tinqueux, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
The Most Friendly in the Skies,"I fly weekly and depending on where I live, I align with one airline program. Since I have moved back to FL and have primarily flown Delta I have been a Diamond Medallion member for the last 5 years and can honestly say that none of the airlines can touch the level of professionalism and friendliness that Delta provides their guests, no matter where you are sitting in the plane. The attendants actually shake my hand and thank me for my business at the end of most flights and are always accommodating beyond their traditional role. I can't say enough about Delta. As an added note, flights from East Coast to West Coast are extremely inexpensive ($350+) and East Coast flights between Florida and NY average $200+.",June 2017,Delta Air Lines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729060-Reviews-Delta-Air-Lines,World,flights,5.0,4.0
