Great experience if you're visiting in the late afternoon,"The sightseeing is unexplainable,magical and massive. The only issue is that the tour is one direction because of covid,so it is a problem to go back if you feel unwell due to extremely high temperature and a lack of shade,but if visiting Athens,this is definitely on your must see list! (If possible in the late afternoon/evening)",August 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great hotel and services,"Despite all the mess about covid19, this hotel and it's employees made us feel relaxed and done everything possible for us to enjoy a well deserved summer break! Extremely professional, friendly and helpful people! For instance,my son was not well, Christiana reassured me with both personal advice and offer to support in a way of calling a dr if needed at any time,then late checkout due to time of flight they have let us stay in room until late afternoon with no extra cost. Rooms are nice,comfortable mattresses and pillows,everything is clean,sheets and towels changed every day. There is a big choice of tv channels in room at no extra cost,also a small fridge which is perfect for a water and fruit. Everything is new and renovated and neat. We were enjoying our cocktails by the pool and it was amaizing time! Not to mention the lovely Aegean Spa staff-all of them are so lovely and professional,offering friendly advices and 10* massages and beauty products! All in all one brilliant summer holiday, would recommend it to everyone",August 2020,Dolce by Wyndham Athens Attica Riviera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1189587-d250607-Reviews-Dolce_by_Wyndham_Athens_Attica_Riviera-Vravrona_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Vravrona, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Mrs Buljovcic,"It is very nice but employees are like prisoners, in the pool bar they have to wear black shirts treat your employees as you would like to be treated!!! They shouldwear bikinis and have their 5 mins/hour to get in the pool. Be more human!",August 2019,Hotel Esplai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g580327-d292115-Reviews-Hotel_Esplai-Calella_Catalonia.html,"Calella, Spain",hotels,3.0,2.5
