Credit cards or foreign debit cards not accepted.,"It is really a pity that after such a good meal that last experience I got from the night is a negative one. When paying I was told that they didn’t accept any credit card or any foreign debit cards. I had to leave the restaurant and look for a cash machine to get some money to pay my bill. In today’s world, this is something completely strange and not acceptable to me. The food was really great and an efficient service, but it ended in a disappointing way.",February 2020,Casa del Sabor Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187331-d1815880-Reviews-Casa_del_Sabor_Restaurant-Hamburg.html,"Hamburg, Germany",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Try the Tangerine-Ginger flavor,"Decided to try a strange flavor and when I saw the Tangerine-Ginger available, two things I love, that could only be my decision. It was a perfect blend of both flavours, just delicious. They have several other different flavours which allows for some interesting options.

"Great service, food and place","Had dinner on a Tuesday night and the place has very few people. The service was very efficient, we didn’t have to wait too long for the food, and the waiter was extremely nice. The food itself was delicious, typical Greek one. For two adults we stayed with starters and for 3 kids we ordered two steaks which was more than enough for them. The place is really well decorated giving a very nice atmosphere. In all a very nice meal and time and not an expensive place.

Come down through the stairs,Amazing building. We started with a quick visit inside the church which is very beautiful with four different organs. Then we took the lift to the tower where you have a great 360 degrees view of the city. But the must to do is coming down from the top by the stairs. There are several stages with different information and details of the tower/church which you will miss if coming up and down through the lift. There is a fee of 6 € to go to the top of tower.

A great example of what war does,This is an historic place which is a great example of what war does to all of us. The church was destroyed in the Second World War by allies airplane bombings and the site was kept like it is to remind all war victims. You don’t need more than 15-20 minutes to walk around the site and read all the information around but is is a must see for its historic meaning. There is a lift to the top of the tower but I didn’t go up.

Interesting piece of engineering,Very interesting walk across the tunnel. Not much to see on the other side but you can have a nice different view of Hamburg from the other side of the river. Make sure to try the big elevator. It won’t take you more than 30 min but I think it is well worth and for free.,February 2020,Alter Elbtunnel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187331-d592930-Reviews-Alter_Elbtunnel-Hamburg.html,"Hamburg, Germany",attractions,5.0,4.5
Alternative pizza concept,"What a great surprise when we entered. This is really an alternative place. You choose which ingredients you want on your pizza on top of the single base of tomato, mozzarella and olive oil. The pizza was delicious and the music excellent, so a place I would go back every day. Congratulations.

Ancient road in Athens and part of ancient wall,This was a very nice experience. Very few people in the site and a relax wandering around. Make sure you read all the instructions signs which clear describe what was build there. Highlights for me are the ancient road which was one of the main entrances to Athens and a small part of the ancient wall. We skipped the museum as we were in a hurry but still had a very good perspective of the site.

"Strange experience, with ok food but totally overpriced","We were just wandering around in the port and chose this restaurant based on TA. It was around 13.15 when we got in and it was totally empty and the waiters seemed very surprised to see us. We had to ask twice if the restaurant was open as they didn’t react to our arrival. When we were looking at the menu and asking some queries there was some communication issues. Eventually we got there but the menu is not totally clear. For a Greek salad, a handful of steamed mussels, two fishes weighting 1,2 kg, one small dose of French fries, bread, and two beers, the bill came at a total of 165 euros. To pay such a value I would be expecting a much higher service and better food, a the food was just ok. I caught one of the male waiters staring at us at lest twice, not sure why, but this was weird.
By the way, there isn’t a single meat dish in the menu, only fish. I would not return back.",February 2020,Papaioannnou Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g9609272-d3709287-Reviews-Papaioannnou_Restaurant-Mikrolimano_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Mikrolimano, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"Just sit, enjoy the atmosphere and go back in time","One of my preferred places in the Acropolis site due to its atmosphere.

Best view is from the top inside the Acropolis,"A quite imposing a ciente theatre. Best view is from the top already inside the Acropolis site, just before getting in the Acropolis.

The highlight of Athens,"An amazing experience which shall be experienced by all. We decided to use the East entrance which is the less crowded and take the ancient Peripatos Way which goes around the Acropolis. This was a great way to see the grandiosity of the place, so many different details that you will never be aware if you just go directly to the top. It is also like going really back in time and win your chance to enter the citadel above. Of course reaching the top and having the opportunity to learn so much about how this extraordinary place was in the past, it is definitely the highlight of any trip to Athens.

A great view and a great walk,This is definitely a place to go. The walk uphill was very nice even for the kids. It is kind of doing some easy hiking and the view from the top is really amazing. Not only to the Acropolis but also towards the sea. We were on top for around 20 minutes as it is really nice to sit and enjoy the view. On the way down don’t forget to check the Socrates Prison which is quite close.,February 2020,Philopappos Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d523835-Reviews-Philopappos_Hill-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nice food but avoid the smoothies,"Stopped here to have lunch before going up the hill to the Acropolis. We sat outside as the weather was very nice. The food is fine, nothing special but good enough. We tried the chicken and pork gyros pita, and the spaghetti bolognese. We ordered some smoothies which were very disappointing. I am ok with having a smoothie with frozen fruit but having it with half of water does not count as a smoothie for me. And paying 7 euros for each is definitely something I regret. Anyway, the service was efficient, and the location is great just close to the north entrance.",February 2020,Spezie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d6507874-Reviews-Spezie-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,3.5
"Great for kids and adults, but not cheap","Well, this is a place that for sure you will want to take a look if you are with kids. But it is also really nice for adults. The highlight is the decoration but the desserts are also at the same level. Be aware that the portions are quite big, therefore sharing is definitely something to think about. It is not cheap if you compare with other things in Greece. You can easily spend the same here for desserts than for a full lunch/dinner. But definitely recommend as an experience.",February 2020,Little Kook,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d9710322-Reviews-Little_Kook-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Take a look inside if you are aroung,It is a little bit hide but it definitely deserves a quick look inside. It is a very small church but quite charming. There was a wedding going on when we were going to the top of the hill but it was already possible to look inside when we were coming down. The building is quite interesting with some parts made of wood. It doesn’t take more than a few minutes to visit.,February 2020,Ierós Naós Agíou Dimitríou Loumpardiári,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d8028594-Reviews-Ieros_Naos_Agiou_Dimitriou_Loumpardiari-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
All food delicious and great service,"I have to start saying that this has been so far our best meal in our three days in Athens. The place is really nice, the service was outstanding, mainly the lovely Irina who treated very well, and the most important thing, the food was delicious. The kids asked for a chicken souvlaki which is more than enough for 2 people. We also tried the Greek salad and the grilled vegetables with Haloumi and were both very good. Finally the moussaka was really tasty. I have to consider the price cheap for the service and food we got. The bread and tap water are free, and we even had three desserts for free. 45 euros for 5 people is really a great value. Well done and I definitely recommend it.",February 2020,Bandiera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10445516-Reviews-Bandiera-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Don’t miss the public latrines!!!,"It is part of the Ticket Package and definitely a place to spend some 20/30 minutes. Main places to take a look are the arch in the entrance, the tower of winds in the back of the site, and the public latrines on the right of the tower. This was the main market area in the Roman times and you need to use your imagination to think about this place which was for sure a crowded place. It is definitely about going back in time and an easy place for young kids to like and investigate as it is small and quick to visit.

"Believe it or not, just go with the flow","On our way down from the top of the hill we checked the Prison of Socrates. There is not real evidence that Socrates was imprisoned here but it is always great to somehow believe and be part of history. Just imagining that one of the great man of our history could have been here makes it worth to go.

Historic place with a good Acropolis view,"Coming down from the top of the hill we passed and spend some minutes at the Pnyx.

Tasty Fried food but not fresh seafood,"First of all it is important manage some expectations. This is not a fresh seafood place, unless the definition is quite different than mine. The majority of the dishes available are fried, and served in a type of tapas small plates. We tried different dishes, the fried small shrimps and fried squids were delicious. The fried anchovies were good also, but the fried mussels were disappointing. The fried cod and chips was ok with big portion of fish.

Delicious ice cream,"Decided to try by chance and what a lucky ones we were. The ice cream was delicious, I tried the dark chocolate and the lemon mint flavors and both were so very tasty. There was a very small queue but the service is really fast and efficient. Only a handful of high chairs to sit so you really need to step out and eat outside.

Worth if you have the Package Ticket,"It is a site that you can take a look in some 15/20 min. The columns are quite impressive, mainly the one knocked down, which clearly shows how they were built. The summer ticket is 8 euros and the off peak season half of the price, but in my opinion is only worth if you have the package ticket.

A true Greek experience,"A kind of unique place, very small with almost no space to eat inside. There are some plastic chairs and table outside where we sat to eat our Souvlakis which were really delicious. The fries were very tasteful, a lot of salt and oregano, although on the cold side already. The experience of ordering inside, talking with the people that are cooking the meat, looking at the grill, was something special. Very few tourists and mainly locals taking away their food.

Probably the best fish soup I ever ate,"Based on other reviews I decided to try this restaurant and it was a good experience. A great reception in the entrance and I was surprisingly taken to the basement, a very nice space.

An excellent early dinner,"Decided to go for an early dinner around 17.30 and no surprising I was only one of two customers. Service was quite fast and the food was really delicious. Ordered a lamb curry dish with some garlic naan, and both were very tasty. As a starter I got a couple papadums, which were positively very different than any I have eaten before, and the samosas which were big and really good.

An overall nice experience,"An interesting setting in a old manor with a nice decoration. There was only another table with people in the restaurant therefore it was quiet. We ordered some starters and Polvo à Lagareiro as a main dish. The starters were good but the Polvo (octopus) was average, a little bit overcooked and blend. The service was good and attentive, having suggested a very good wine.

Delicious food and excellent wine,"Went back after a couple of years and had another great experience. All the food was really delicious and the suggested wine was exquisite.

Definitely not a 5 stars hotel,"I have to start by saying that it is really difficult to accept this hotel as a 5 star one. It has been a huge disappointment having been in similar hotels in Porto. The pool should not be called a pool as we are talking about a 4x4 meters water tank. Having only four chairs to sit/lay down in the pool/sauna area tells it all about the space that is available. The bedrooms are another space that are not up to a 5 stars hotel. Small areas, no special features, very bad finishings, poor isolation on the windows, it seems like there was definitely a savings focus when building it. In fact, on the two nights we were there, in the passageway from the reception to the back building where the rooms are, it was dripping in the several places, with buckets on the corridor collecting the water.
The bar is at the same level. The octopus salad was more a lettuce salad with very few octopus. I know it was the daily snack dish, and it was only 5 euros, but again I was expecting more and a different approach. When we ordered a tea and we were presented with a tea bag which you can buy in any supermarket, there is not much you can do to defend it.

An amazing experience in the last night,"After following ABO on social media for some time, we decided to try to watch the Aurora Borealis and decided to come here. After 3 frustrating nights, as it was very cloudy and snowing, we had an amazing experience in our last night there. Our friend Aurora decided to give us an amazing show which we will remember for the rest of our lifes. Even being cold outside, we spend around 3 hours looking up in all directions. Bring clothing to be outside in freezing temperatures.
The breakfast is a cold one but with several different options, which was more than enought for adults and kids. The opportunity to have breakfast until 12.00 gives the opportunity to wake up later and have a much more relaxed stay.
Be aware that the site is still being developed, so there were some works going around, including some machinery noise.
There are daily shuttles to the nearest town for some shopping as you will need to cook in the apartments, as there is not other choice nearby.

"Excellent Food, Setting and Price","This was a very good experience. We were a party of 7 people, and arrived around 12.00 and were the only customers in the restaurant. Not a very appealing situation but we decided to stay and that was the right decision. All the food we choose was very good, from the fish soup to the Triple Artic dish where we can try whale, reindeer and seal. The only downside is a lack of any specific child dishes, but we were able to find something to everybody. The place is an old fishing warehouse and it is a type of museum, and it was great to have the opportunity to spend some time taking a look at old objects used in the past.

Delicious food but not the perfect experience,"Decided to try this restaurant as it was closer to my hotel and based on TA reviews. Arrived around 20.00 on a Sunday and the restaurant was quite full.
While the person who took me to the table spoke to me in English, and there were menus in English, 3 waiters come to me and the moment I asked them if we could speak English they just disappeared. Eventually, and after some 10 minutes, there was a gentleman, who for sure was not a waiter, which came to me and took my order. Although I have ordered a salad as a starter, a bread based dish, and a Lamb stew as a main, the main dish and the salad came together and only some 20 minutes after I finished those two the bread based dish arrived. It was a quite strange situation as I have asked the waiter for the order of the dishes.
Although I was alone and therefore not talking with anyone, the music was slightly louder than I believe it should. But the most important thing is definitely the food, and all 3 dishes were delicious. Very good indeed. If I am alone I most likely will go back, not sure if I will be with someone else as I don’t think trying to chat on top of the music will be a pleasant experience.",April 2019,Saperavi Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298484-d2418263-Reviews-Saperavi_Cafe-Moscow_Central_Russia.html,"Moscow, Russia",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Excellent steak and service,"Arrived with a couple of friends and as we didn’t have a reservation we were seated in a back room. That was a little bit disappointing as there is no atmosphere there. Although the positive side was that it was less noisy than in the main room. The food was excellent. The Machete steak was delicious and perfectly cooked.

An humble place with good food,"Came here just because it was one of the closest restaurants to my hotel. It is a very humble place, good service and good enough food.

Good location but allrest average,"The only positive think is the location, all the rest is average. The price is consistent with the hotel, therefore it is not expensive. When I was doing my booking I realised that the price during the week was half than on the weekend.
There was only 1 lift working during the entire stay, and no sign or information about the other one not being operational. It is not difficult to find out after a couple of days... Honesty and transparency are values that you should aim for.
The breakfast is as expected quite average. One day there was a waffles machine available, but as the machine was doing only one waffle at a time, and at a rate of 2,5 minutes per waffle, with a queue of 5 or 6 people everytime, people need to wait 15/20 minutes for an opportunity. Make another machine available please, it wouldn't cost much...
The cleaning service of the rooms is definitely low standard. One day the cleaner came to our room, didn't clean the room, took the used towels, and didn't leave new ones. That was a first time.
The swimming pool is ok, and a good spot for the kids in the end of the day.

"A lot of animals and birds, great for children","A lot of animals and birds, the children loved it. The birds show was amazing with a couple of really strange animals which i have never saw before.
It was a hot day, but there are enough shadows around to escape the sun. That was a saturday and there were some activities in the internal ""main square"",with water, ice creams, different food and some gifts being available for free, which was very nice.
On a downside, although a small area, it is sometimes not easy to navigate around due to the lack of signs and the not so much useful map you are given in the entrance.
On a quite negative note, it is for difficult to understand why you need to pay the car parking. Be prepared to pay 10 USD for the car paking.

Excellent experience,"Having great expectations about The Yeatman I have to say that there were met but there were some details which shall not happen in such a quality hotel. When we arrived at the bedroom the AC was not working and the door to the varanda was not closing. Having called the reception both problems were sorted out immediately. The bedroom was great, very spacious and a nice king bed. The breakfast was one of the highlights of our stay with a lot of variety and delicious stuff. Ask for a table near the windows for amazing views. The spa and the indoor pool were very nice although the air temperature was slightly cold and was not comfortable to stay after leaving the pool. The gym has several machines and quite nice options. The location is good, we were able to walk to Porto downtown easily. Service was very efficient, and we were even able to check in earlier than usual as the room was available.
The hotel is like a museum, make sure you take a walk around all floors as they all have a theme with things to see. The same for the interior stairs between the floors with a great chronology of events.

The atmosphere is very nice and the service superb. Loreta took really good care of us and provided an excellent service.

Impossible to turn off noisy AC but a great breakfast,"Stayed here for one night and a mixed sensation about the place. The room was fine with enough space for a single person. The main problem courted when I wanted to turn off the AC as it was making some noise for me to sleep. After looking around for a way to turn it off without success, I called the reception to be told that it was not possible as the AC had a single system for the all building and could be turned off per room. I appreciate that it is not necessarily a problem for everybody, but it was for me who like to sleep with silence. On a positive note, the breakfast was really good, with different options from smoothies, natural orange juice, to the traditional British options. I had probably the best mushrooms I ever ate in an hotel. In summary, I am not sure if I will come back.

Average tapas with good service,"Visited on Monday night as part of a party of four and we were the only customers during the couple of hours we were there. Definitely November is a quiet time of the year. The service was efficient and polite. We ordered different tapas, meatballs, patatas bravas, the manchego cheese, chorizo, pardon peppers. For someone that has eaten tapas in several different places, and also in Spain, there is a clear benchmark and unfortunately these were not more than average. The pardon peppers were still less than that. The chorizo was too small, while on a positive note the meatballs were quite good.
The price was reasonable, I personally paid around 350 nok with a beer but without any dessert.

That completely killed the dinner as we were eating some spicy food.
The waiter told us that there was a lot of work in the bar, but the restaurant was not even full, therefore if you are not prepared to have a level of service enough to serve drinks in due time, you better go and do something else.
