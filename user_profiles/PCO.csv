Actually Quite Good,"We stopped for a short notice meal and were pleasantly surprised. The service was good, price was very reasonable and the food was quite good. Choice of 4 joints, all the veg and two types of roasties. Veg could have been a bit hotter and an extra server on the carvery would have made it a bit quicker",December 2020,Toby Carvery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g503869-d3474031-Reviews-Toby_Carvery-Hemel_Hempstead_Hertfordshire_England.html,"Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.0
Fascinating Slice through History,"Probably the focus of most tourist visits to Athens, this did not disappoint. there is a lot of work going on to restore and protect the whole site but given that parts of it are 3000 years old . Be warned its not disabled friendly and is a bit of a hike uphill on pretty uneven surfaces",October 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Excellent Food,This place is probably worth a visit on its own. Great food and terrific view of the Acropolis. It would have rated 5 starts but the service was indifferent.,October 2020,Acropolis Museum Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2076068-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Well Worth a Visit,This is a really interesting place for the history buffs and the top floor exhibition of original stones laid out correctly to scale is fascinating.

Really Excellent Restaurant,Close the Acropolis Museum and Metro its worth hunting thus place out. The 3 of us chose a range of mains fro. An interesting menu which included vegetarian and fish options. We all agreed our choices were excellent; the best meal we had in Athens and all the others were good too. Take a trip away from the main tourist area around the Agora and try this place - you won't be disappointed.,October 2020,Mani Mani,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d695929-Reviews-Mani_Mani-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Location,The hotel is very well located only a 5-10 min walk of the Acropolis and only slightly longer to the main sites. If you are lucky you may get a room with an oblique view of it from the link balcony. Room was well appointed with a nice bathroom and the 3rd bed we requested was a proper one not a sofa bed. Pool area looked nice but water was freezing. We ate in the top floor restaurant on our first night and had a excellent meal. The area was mainly residential but there was plenty of bars and restaurants in the area.,October 2020,Divani Palace Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d230391-Reviews-Divani_Palace_Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Excellent Sunday Lunch,"Just enjoyed a really good Sunday lunch in a very Covid aware environment that still managed to retain its atmosphere. Set menu priced at £22/26 for 2/3 courses and the food was excellent. Unhurried, friendly and attentive staff managed to be both efficient and unobtrusive at the same time.

It's a long walk,"The train was not operating and, though a pleasant walk, was more of an ordeal in wind and rain.

Loved it.,"Booked ahead and got a table inside, on a warm evening an outside table would have been lovely as its a great setting.

Really excellent fish and chips,"Tried for an inside table but restaurant was running shorter hours as part of its CoVid recovery and it was too cold to sit outside,
so settled for takeaway fish and chips. Hardly really ""settled for"" as, apart from the eating in the car, it was the best fish and chips ever.

Nice Hotel on the Edge of Town,"Hotel is located about 15 mins walk from the lifts by the ski school meeting place and a little closer to the gondola. A shuttle is available and they have an ""arrangement"" with Rent and Go for ski/books storage which is well worthwhile pretty much wherever you are staying.
The hotel has a bit of character and charm but was very quiet when we stayed. A very good breakfast buffet with a cooked option available on demand. Not sure whether they do evening meals but there are plenty of places in town. There is plenty of free parking outside the hotel. The rooms are comfortable and very warm if probably a little dated and our room had a tiny shower cubicle. Everything was spotlessly clean.
Getting here is a relatively easy 75min drive from Turin, mostly on motorway with only the last 10 miles on mountain roads which were kept clear throughout our stay. Get winter tyres and/or chains for peace of mind though.",January 2020,Hotel Belvedere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g194919-d530436-Reviews-Hotel_Belvedere-Sestriere_Province_of_Turin_Piedmont.html,"Sestriere, Italy",hotels,4.0,3.5
Excellent New Year's Eve Meal,"Booked late and was pleased to find no excessive New Year's Eve surcharge or pricing, normal menu with specials and a £10 deposit to book a table. Place was lively with a mix of eating a drinks only customers. Serving staff were great. Shout out to Josie who managed to look calm and smiley all evening whilst seeming to be in perpetual motion. Food was very good, I had the rump off the specials menu which was good to a perfect ""medium well"" and the others had burgers of differing sizes which were equally good. have been before and would definitely go back.",December 2019,The Beech House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186306-d7060644-Reviews-The_Beech_House-St_Albans_Hertfordshire_England.html,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Very Good Food,"Restaurant is the top floor of a very ancient timbered building, with seating for about 50. We chose for the al la carte menu where starters are £7-14, mains £16-32 and a variety of sides in the £3-5 range. There are 2 or 3 course set menu options available for lunchtimes and weekdays. I had a very tasty french onion soup for starter (could have been a main) and a main if liver and bacon which was cooked to perfection. Others in the party had the daal or duck for their mains bother very good, but they did look on enviously as tempura plaice arrived at the adjacent table - menu envy. Drinks are about the price you would expect from the standard of restaurant but they did serve glass by the wine which is good if not all of your party are drinking. Overall an excellent meal served in a very pleasant setting with good unobtrusive service. Its quite pricey if you have 3 courses on a Saturday night with some sides and drinks, but a great location for a special occasion meal.",November 2019,Loft Stalbans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186306-d13234128-Reviews-Loft_Stalbans-St_Albans_Hertfordshire_England.html,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
3rd Visit and we would come back,"This was our 3rd visit to Grand Palladium though before although we booked Kentenah we were allocated Colonial. No real difference, but I did feel the room was slightly more ""tired"" than previous years. We have returned twice because of all the good things other reviewers have mentioned: food - quality and variety; facilities - extensive; beach - lovely (but you need to pick your entry point to avoid some rocks); staff - friendly and efficient; animation team - full of fun and energy; evening entertainers - really, really good. There was no issue with seaweed which has previously been reported on this coastline. We would certainly return and have happily recommended the place to friends and family.

The resort is huge but there are loads of trips bookable either through the hotel or your travel company. We can recommend Excaret and Xplor, both brilliant days out, we did the ATV/Cenote and Zip-lining trip which was a blast, and caught ""Collectivos"" for 40 pesos to Playa del Carmen and to the ruins at Tulum which is worth a visit, you can hire a guide when you get there.

Overall we have enjoyed 3 excellent holidays at this hotel and are already thinking about a 4th. My daughter is even going to try and get a gap year job there as she speaks Spanish.",October 2019,Grand Palladium Kantenah Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g499445-d295150-Reviews-Grand_Palladium_Kantenah_Resort_Spa-Akumal_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Akumal, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great location and good food,"Enjoyed a Sunday Lunch at this lovely riverside spot. The set 2 or 3 course menu was very good value and the al a carte though more expensive didn't seem unreasonable. personally, I enjoyed the roast lamb and Sunday lunch trimmings which was prepared very well. Tried my daughter's ham hock terrine starter, full of flavour if a little salty. Sweets were tasty too. For a party of 8 with drinks our bill was ""50 including a service charge. There is a tiny car park but plenty of street parking nearby though it was a Sunday I imagine it was be a little more hectic during the week. The restaurant also has an outdoor refreshment kiosk and you can hire punts as well to get the full Oxford experience.",May 2019,Cherwell Boathouse Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186361-d718483-Reviews-Cherwell_Boathouse_Restaurant-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html,"Oxford, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Very good steak place,"If you like an occasional steak, then go somewhere where its their speciality, and this place is just that. This is a very old pub by a small river. Looks good inside and has some outside seating (way too cold when we went). Its not particularly expensive with £25.95 fixed price 3 course Sunday menu. The portions are reasonably generous and our party of 4 shared 2 meals. Steaks were excellent and even well done retained their flavour and were tender and juicy. Both starters - mushrooms and scallops- were highly rated and tge puddings were good too. Add in the very friendly servuce from Jill and you have the recipe for a great meal out.",May 2019,Miller & Carter Wheathampstead,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3207818-d3222513-Reviews-Miller_Carter_Wheathampstead-Wheathampstead_St_Albans_Hertfordshire_England.html,"Wheathampstead, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Well worth buying a skip the line package to save queuing.,"The high point - literally - of our trip. We paid extra to skip the lines which was worth it.

Good Value and reasonably close to .the Eiffel Toer,"Enjoyed 4 nights here over Easter as part of a Eurostar Package weekend. Hotel is about 1km from the base of the Tower and if your room is high enough and facing the right way you may even get a view. Its also close to a couple of Metro lines about 7 mins walk. First room allocated had not been serviced even though we were checking in at 5pm. We were then upgraded to a better room, so thanks. The place was very busy but the room was quiet and comfortable. Only complaint was they did not advertise the single bottle of Evian left in an otherwise empty fridge wasn't complimentary so a bit surprised by a €20 charge after we had checked out otherwise it would be 5 stars.

Its a €25 taxi ride from Gare du Nord which in retrospect would have been worthwhile having been pickpocked and had £80 stolen and the faff of cancelling cards, obviously nothing the hotel could do about that.",April 2019,Novotel Paris Centre Tour Eiffel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d233528-Reviews-Novotel_Paris_Centre_Tour_Eiffel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,4.0,3.5

Great place to eat traditional food,"We enjoyed a very snowy Saturday night meal at this place.

Excellent hotel only 100 metres from lifts,"We shared a double room which was equipped with full facilities for a self catering holiday, though we just boiled water for drinks and ate out. It was spotlessly clean and run by a very friendly family team in traditional Austrian dress. Breakfast was typical Austrian fare, rolls, meats, cheeses, fruits and cereals and plenty to set you up for the day. There is parking adjacent to the Hotel but its worth getting a space in the underground car park if you can to reduce the amount of digging out when it snows heavily. Kuhtai is about 40 mins from Innsbruck Airport but if the weather is bad chains are needed. Hotel Kristal at the far end of Kuhtai with a walk of 15 mins to the main centre.

Very impressed so coming back again this year,"Stayed for 2 weeks on a TUI All Inc trip across the UK October half term. This place is terrific. Very big with excellent staff, loads of top quality restaurants, good buffets if you are impatient, several pools and a fantastic beach. Used the gym daily and daughter had a spa treatment as a birthday present, she loved it but I thought it was on the pricey side. The whole place is well run, looks good, is well maintained and just very, very good. Its an hour from Cancun and about 20mins by the the local mini-bus to Playa del Carmen and tge Tulem ruins. Would we go, we are this year but self-booking via Netflights rather than TUI as they had no availability.

Good value skiing hotel with great staff,"Just returned fron a 5 night stay booked via Neilson. This hotel is well located about 300 meters from the slopes. The hotel had a ski room but we rented lockers at Rent and Go.
Rooms are a reasonable size with an ensuite with a whirlpool bath and shower over, warm and clean. Food was fine, though the evening meals could have been served a bit hotter. Also suggest you move the plate warmer adjacent to the hot food buffet not the salad bar. There was an excellent selection of wines and the bar prices didn't seem excessive. The hotel had a small spa with steam room, sauna and jacuzzi as well as a couple of basic fitness machines. The guests were a mix of English and Italian in varying size and age family groups.

Good budget alternative,"Just returned from a 4 day trip. Hotel was operated on a budget but rooms though (very) compact were clean and warm. Food was good though portions probably a little on the small side. Chalet staff were great. All very young but they worked hard for their customers. To much time was allowed for the 2hr transfer as the roads were snow and traffic free. This place never pretended to be a 5 star option, the price should make that quite clear, but if you are on a tight budget this compromise option may mean you could ski every year.

We had a great view from the top-floor penthouse terrace out to sea and down the Malecon which is not as lively as the tourist info would suggest. Breakfast was fine though you have to aware that the menu is limited by what they have available.

Interesting and well located,The lift was out so I was given an upgraded junior suite on the 1st floor at the back. Lovely well-equipped room with a proper seating out area and a good bathroom.

Best theme park ever (for a 12 yr old),"Just returned and visited several times over our 2 week stay. Disappointed the The Hulk ride, which is one of Orlando's best, is off line until 2016. The food was plentiful but not cheap. The rides are great fun, particular the Harry Potter area and the water rides (you will get wet and in the case of Bilge Barge Rats, thoroughly drenched).

Good Standard well located Orlando Accommodation,"Just returned from 2 weeks at the Sheraton. The property is huge with 20+ blocks scattered over a very large site. We stayed in a one-bed in Key West area. There was nothing wrong with the apartment but it was too small really for 3 people as there was barely enough room for the sofa bed when opened. Also, no balcony which was no biggy but a surprise. It was generally well equipped and the washer dryer meant all our clothes came back clean. It is a couple of minutes drive from the main outlet mall at the south end of I-drive. The i-Ride shuttle stops outside and you could use them to get to Universal, Sea World and Wet and Wild without hiring a car, the hotel has a shuttle to Disney and if you miss the return its about $25-30 for a taxi back.

Great Day Out - get there early,"There is a huge variety of things to see and do here and arriving at 10:30 on an organised trip when the park opened at 8:30 meant we ran out of time.

However, there was too much queuing and the whole thing seemed overcrowded, rushed and a prime example of Merlin squeezing every ounce from their customers in pursuit of profit.

Best Ever All-Inclusive,"This was our 10th all-inc holiday and the 6th in the Carribean and without doubt it was a class above anything we have enjoyed before. Firstly to answer some negative comments that I have seen:

The hotel can do nothing about - the flight time and quality from the UK; transfer time from Cancun (its 40min direct); the road from the highway (v pot-holed); weather (3 days of tropical downpour); departure tax (£45 each); prices in local shops (same as UK); rough sea (great fun).

So to the things that the hotel does very well:
The staff, whatever their roles, are excellent, and a special shout out to Carlos whose first day coincided with our arrival. He is a brilliant character and waiter and we expect to see him as Restaurant and then Food and Beverage manager in future visits.

The property is spotlessly clean and has immaculate well-groomed grounds. The beach has been built up and protected so that it is in excellent condition and safe for children (look next door to see how rocky it used to be). All the food outlets serve excellent food with plenty of choice. Sea Olive served me the best New York strip steak I have ever had - 3 days in a row. Availabity at the booked restaurants was generally OK. The kids club is terrific with excellent staff and equipment and a good programme of activities. The 3 pools are great, clean and with warm water, and no room is more than a few steps from its entrance to one of them. All have swim up bars and there were always plenty of loungers available somewhere. The Spa was first class and there are all sorts of deals available.

The daily entertainment programme at the infinity pool was reasonably low-key and not pressured, though why they feel the need to play club music all the time is beyond me; fine when it supports an activity but then switch it off please. If people want to listen music its unlikely to be what the animation team want and most have iPods or similar. Evening entertainment was luittle too late for those with young children but the circus and acrodance shows which I saw were very good.

The hotel hosts numerous weddings, mostly at weekends so there is an infux of travellers mostly from the US and Canada. Remember guys, Spring Break is a High School/College thing and if you are getting married at an expensive resort you are probably old enough to behave with a bit more decorum, there are children about! If someone's wedding booking has gone wrong that is desparate for them and the hotel does not have a suitably romantic fallback for seriusly weather-affected weddings.

The resort is about a 7 min walk from breakfast restauarnt to beach and you can always hitch a wide on a buggy. We were in Villa 12 and it was fine. Villas 5-9 were a littel closer to the beach but hey you're on holiday the walk will do you good.

Would we go back? most certainly and we would be happy to recommend it to friends who could come back and haunt us if it went wrong.

A Tip - the resort touts a holiday bond scheme (Prestige Traveller) and you will be induced to attend. If remotely interested, go as early in your holiday as possible that way if you do buy a package you can probably try for a free upgrade for your stay. Even if you do not buy you do get some worthwhile rewards for giving up a couple fo hours of your time (ask for Sara, she was excellent)",October 2013,The Fives Beach Hotel & Residences,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150812-d1141280-Reviews-The_Fives_Beach_Hotel_Residences-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great Day Out,"This is a very slick operation, if a tad pricy but it was well worth it. If you are in or near Playa del Carmen book online and get a taxi, not only will it save you some money but you can get there for first opening and arrange a pick up after it closes so you get to stay as long as possible and do the shopping and photo bit after its shut.",October 2013,Xplor Park by Xcaret,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g150812-d4882791-Reviews-Xplor_Park_by_Xcaret-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Great, fun location but very hot","Our party of 9 had 3 rooms on thje reception level. The rooms and quite bright and cheery with a double bed and bunk beds in the family rooms. Its quite expensive, particularly as it no longer includes free access to the actual splash park, but you do get early access to the Theme Park which allows you to queue jump at lease one of the top rides.
The staff and overall standards were good, parking is only a couple of mins from the monorail to the Park. A couple of points to note: it is not air conditioned so in the current heatwave was uncomfortably hot at night; there is evening entertainment which can be very noisly if you are in a room close to the bar area.",July 2013,Splash Landings Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g504148-d282437-Reviews-Splash_Landings_Hotel-Alton_Staffordshire_England.html,"Alton, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,3.5

Good value holiday hotel,"Just returned from a very enjoyable week here. I would be pushed to accept its 5 star status though the staff were terrific across the hotel. The rooms are a little dated, quite sparsely furnished but very clean with nice bathrooms. The beds are OK but the pillows are of a poor quality. The main buffet was good but we found it difficult to get a booking at the al a carte restaurants as it is on a first come basis and you have to get there very early (on the way back from putting towels on the sun loungers!) if you want a child friendly eating time. The animiation team were all very enthusiastic and friendly but their love for loud music blaring over the area of the kids pools was annoying and the comment that were should sit elsewhere was unhelpful when we had to be near the shallow part of the pool as we had a yound child. It was a welcome relief when they were off on Thursday and the resport was quiet. the pools are not heated. The kids club seemed OK but did not have much to offer kids over the age of about 8 or 9. The beach is a mix of sand a stones so flip flops/crocs are essential. It is a 90-120 min flog from the airport and it you have a late flight in a Euro 60 taxi maybe a worthwhile investment. The resort is a mix of nations but the Russians and Germans are in the majority.

Overall a very enjoyable week and if you get a good price then great. If comparing 5 star resorts and the Ritz Carlton is the same price, pick the Ritz as I think this would be a 4-star tourist at best.",May 2013,Mitsis Rodos Maris Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1175546-d670578-Reviews-Mitsis_Rodos_Maris_Resort_Spa-Kiotari_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Floridays - excellent place, great location","Just back from 2 weeks at Floridays. I booked direct with an owner which was little cheaper than with Floridays but there was no other difference. The units are large with 2 (or 3) double bedrooms and a comfortable large living area with kitchen, dining and lounge areas and furniture, Floridays is at the Disnet end of I-Drive (stop 40 on the I-Ride). It has a good swimming pool with a red hot hot-tub and is about a 5 minute walk from a small shopping area with a large Pubix supermarket. The hotel runs bookable shuttles to both Disney and Universal and Wet and Wild and if you miss the return a taxi is a very manageble $25-3, with the I-Ride stopping at the entrance you can easily manage an Orlando holiday without the expense of a car.
