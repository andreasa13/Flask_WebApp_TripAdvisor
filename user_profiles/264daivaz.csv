Fantastic views,"We enjoyed exploring Cinque Terre national park and spent the whole day walking the winding pathways, climbing stone stairs, loosing ourselves in narrow streets of each of the five colorful towns.
The wearher was not very typical for this time of the year - only +15 and some rain. Therefore in some parts of the track it was pretty slippery and a bit dangerous. On the other hand and very unfortunately, almost half of the pedestrian path is closed due to landslides. However, conection by train between the towns is indeed very convenient. We stayed in La Spezia - it was convenient due to available parking (in the five Cinque Terre towns parking is really an issue) and we took a train to Riomaggiore to begin our trip.
No need for special equipment nor you have to be very fit. I would say the pathway is medium in terms of difficulty.

The access is very different, as the monasteries were built on purpose to be not accessible. Of course these days they are adapted and to some of them access is quite easy.

Great desert experience,"We spent one day in Wadi Rum desert with Wadi Rum Nomads, arranging all that one could expect in a desert - tour around the desert in open 4wd, bedouin style lunch and dinner, walking through the sand dunes and breathtaking gorges, and beautiful sunset on the rocks of the desert. The guide who was driving the 4wd was speaking English and was very much helpful. But the desert experience wouldn't be complete without sleeping in a tent, under the stars. Despite it was pretty cold (the sleeping tent was not heated but we were provided with truly warm blankets), it was just amazing, feeling like in 1000-star hotel.

"Nice, new and clean but lack of facilities and overpriced","We stayed at Campus Viridis with kids for 3 nights. The location is great for exploring Aukstaitija region, known for its nature and plentiful of lakes.
The property is newly built, nice and clean, yet the offered services and facilities are very basic.
The room facilities were basic, we only had refrigerator and electric kettle in the kitchenette. Catering facilities are very limited in the area, thus electric stove would be an advantage, but it was not there.
Also for the room price one would expect a hair dryer. We also lacked brush to clean the floor, as the room service is not offered. Therefore, I think that the property is really overpriced compared to other similar properties in the Lithuanian countryside and the service offered for that price.
There is a restaurant run by the same company. The food is good and tasty, yet the prices are comparably high, and we had to wait 50 minutes for hamburgers, although the restaurant wasn't busy at that time.",July 2018,Campus Viridis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g7280556-d12723930-Reviews-Campus_Viridis-Paluse_Aukstaitija_National_Park_Utena_County.html,"Paluse, Lithuania",hotels,4.0,4.0

Nice and cosy apartment,"Our family liked the apartment, especially the location, very convenient and easy access to most of Birstonas attractions. The apartment was nice and cosy, newly refurbished, clean and well equipped. Recommended for calm family stay.",July 2017,Vila Liepa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1185641-d12106287-Reviews-Vila_Liepa-Birstonas_Kaunas_County.html,"Birstonas, Lithuania",hotels,5.0,5.0
Nice place for holidays with kids but too busy & noisy,"We liked the hotel, the sea view is 180 almost around! The rooms are large and covenient. There are plenty of attractios for kids, small water park.
Food is not bad but huge queues everywhere: one has to wait in a queue for almost everything, i.e. meat, coffee in the morning, even pancakes, etc. I am not speaking about ice cream which besides the terrible queue is served only 2 hours a day. We end up eating salads and yoghurt, as for this kind of food no queues :) Fruit is also terrible.
In addition, the hotel is rather noisy. We lived on the first floor and at night it is impossible to sleep because of the night club noise in the basement.",May 2017,Justiniano Club Park Conti,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297961-d507992-Reviews-Justiniano_Club_Park_Conti-Alanya_Turkish_Mediterranean_Coast.html,"Alanya, Turkey",hotels,3.0,3.5

Charming place!,Alberobello is a place that really has its own spirit and is worth visiting if you're exploring the Southern Italy.

Nice town for a short visit,"Lecce is located almost at the so called 'heal' of the Italian 'shoe'. The town is called the 'Firenze of the South' yet is much smaller and in a way quite shabby. Many baroque style buildings, impressive Duomo, ancient sites of Roman amfiteatre and theatre are basically the main landmarks.",March 2017,"Centro Storico, Lecce",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g194791-d4724282-Reviews-Centro_Storico_Lecce-Lecce_Province_of_Lecce_Puglia.html,"Lecce, Italy",attractions,3.0,4.5
