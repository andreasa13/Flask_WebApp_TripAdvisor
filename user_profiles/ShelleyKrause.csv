An Enjoyable Ride,"Some of my family came for a visit and said the only thing they really wanted to do was to go on the 2 hour horseback ride through Garden of the Gods. In the 25 years of living in Colorado Springs, I had never done it. I lived on a farm and rode horses throughout the years so I never had any interest in a trail ride. Though this is a typical trail ride where everyone is single file and the pace is a walk, the scenery and people definitely makeup for it. I saw areas of the GOG that I had not hiked through before and there were fantastic views along the way. Academy Riding Stables is well-run, everyone is friendly, professional, and they put the safety of their riders first. The horses were well taken care of and happy. Maggie, our wrangler, could be clearly heard as she talked about the history of the park and shared stories. There were 5 of us on the ride. We booked the morning ride, which I suggest because the sun here is very intense (wear sunscreen, drink water) and afternoon storms sometimes roll in during the summer months. A couple of us forgot to bring hats, and the gal signing us in kindly found spares. They also offered small bottles of water that were gratefully accepted. I wore a fabric backpack to carry water and sunscreen as there are no saddlebags. After the ride, we all agreed the 2 hour ride was worth it and we would gladly go again. We would also be very interested in an early morning ride, if offered. Many of the other reviews cover the fact a novice rider would feel comfortable and experienced riders (with the right expectations) would enjoy seeing GOG on horseback. This was a very enjoyable way to see the natural beauty of the area!",May 2020,Academy Riding Stables,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33364-d560621-Reviews-Academy_Riding_Stables-Colorado_Springs_El_Paso_County_Colorado.html,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Stay,"There's nothing like being greeted with a smile. The entire staff was friendly and professional. The room was very clean, spacious and had everything one could need.

A Gem in Wichita Falls,"Even after a long day of driving the attention to detail was evident as we walked toward the lobby. Gas lanterns were ablaze as we walked into a spacious and welcoming reception area. The staff greeted us warmly, were professional and efficient and we were on our way to our room in minutes. Our king room was large, very clean with nice amenities. I appreciated the quality of the bedding as I drifted off to sleep. The breakfast area had plenty of seating. The free breakfast was standard, good, but the gal working there made the experience great with the welcoming greeting and smile.

Fun Workout,"I surprised my friend for her 40th birthday with a Dragonfly Paddle Yoga session. It was a terrific experience and a great workout. Neither one of us has done much yoga and we had never been on a stand up paddle board. Christine clearly explained everything we needed to know about both and was very encouraging. She made us feel comfortable and confident while making sure we used correct form and balance. We didn't fall in! Our attention and focus was engaged the entire time. Again, it was a really wonderful experience and we plan to incorporate Dragonfly Paddle Yoga into our regular workout.",November 2019,Dragonfly Paddle Yoga,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33364-d12613880-Reviews-Dragonfly_Paddle_Yoga-Colorado_Springs_El_Paso_County_Colorado.html,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",attractions,5.0,5.0
"Beauty, Comfort & a Free Workout","As you walk up and down cobblestone walkways with your luggage after traveling all day just imagine the view that awaits you. It is well worth the effort! (The hotel will send staff to help with luggage.) The view of the Caldera is spectacular from every area of Tzekos Villas. The staff is very hard-working, helpful, friendly and professional. Breakfast is simple, but good. Our balcony had a hot tub where we enjoyed watching the incredible sunsets. Our room was simple, spacious, had everything we needed and a view that I will always remember. Yes, there are stairs...a lot of stairs, but it truly was fine. Again, it was well worth the effort in order to call this property home while in Fira.",October 2019,Tzekos Villas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d294162-Reviews-Tzekos_Villas-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
An Enjoyable Stay,"The location of this property is ideal. It's quiet with restaurants nearby and only a 10 minute walk away from the old town and the port. My husband and I traveled with a group and we walked everywhere.  It is an interesting and lovely city to explore. We found restaurants near and away from the center by the fountain that were all wonderful.  The hotel has an excellent staff, comfortable, clean rooms, and a beautiful pool area.

Fantastic Hotel & Friendly Staff,"This is a fantastic hotel! The location is perfect with the beach, bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk. Still, it's quiet. The architecture and grounds are beautiful. Our room was very clean, tastefully decorated and very comfortable. Housekeeping does an excellent job. We were thrilled to find the hotel laundry service was reasonably priced and the clothes left in the morning were neatly folded and placed in our room by afternoon! The entire staff was wonderful with a friendliness and professionalism that was impressive and exceeded expectations. We were a group of 30 people, all friends and loud at times.

Incredible History & Beauty,"At breakfast a couple of older gentlemen asked my husband if it there was an elevator to the top. When he said no they said they'd pass. Later we saw them strolling to the Plaka. Take the walk to the top and see artful beauty in these ancient and historic temples! The walk is not long, just be prepared - go early, wear shoes with traction (the marble can be slippery), bring water, wear a hat or bring an umbrella if the heat is extreme and read about the incredible history of the Acropolis and Athens...even if only an overview of what was happening in Athens during the time of Pericles realizing his dream of building the temples.

"History, Beauty & Fun","My husband, our friend and I booked a two day private tour of Delphi and Meteora. Eleftheria, who answered all of my questions and requests, was patient (there were many questions) and very helpful throughout the booking process, as well as the entire trip. The tour was fantastic. Our excellent driver, Yannis, promptly picked us up in Athens at our hotel. He was professional and knowledgeable and shared history and stories of the area during the drive. The scenery and terrain were both beautiful and interesting. We walked down to the temple of Athena and up to Delphi and the stadium. When we were finished Yannis took us to a nearby restaurant for lunch then onto the village of Kastraki at the edge of Meteora. After checking into our hotel Yannis drove us through Meteora to see the sunset. Though clouds hindered the sunset it was absolutely beautiful. Dinner in the town of Kastraki was delicious.The next day was spent with a private tour guide, Giorgio, found by Olive Sea Travel. He was terrific and made the experience more complete. After seeing and learning about a few of the monasteries we stopped at Thermopylae, the location of the Spartans last battle. We also stopped at a seaside restaurant for a late lunch on the way back to Athens.

Superior Hotel,"My husband and i stayed with a group of thirty  at the Athens Gate for three nights. We enjoyed our stay very much. Dimitris greeted us at the door giving us a warm first impression, Costos and Kiki checked us in with a smile. The rooms were very clean and quite comfortable. We had a great view of the neighborhood behind the hotel. It was quiet.  The breakfast buffet was filled with a great variety of delicious food and each morning We were we'll taken care of by Panos , George and everyone. The entire staff from reception to housekeeping to restaurant and bar do a superior job. All were welcoming, friendly, professional and helpful. The location is fantastic. I ran through the Plaka and to the top of Lycabettus Hill. There Parliament and is nearby and terrific restaurants and bars steps away.

Beyond Expectations,"We had an absolutely wonderful time with Timos and Thomas (please forgive any misspelling) on the Danae. There were 16 of us and we were very comfortable and had plenty of room for all to stretch out and enjoy the day. And enjoy we did! Timos and Thomas were professional and welcoming, excellent hosts. They prepared coffee, offered wine, beer, snacks and made a delicious meal for us. We visited areas with clear blue water where some of us swam and snorkeled while others relaxed and took in the beauty. One of our group celebrated her birthday onboard. Perfect. Toward the end if our day we stopped with a view of Apollo's Temple and watched a spectacular sunset. Thomas mentioned that he's in a band and since we had time he surprised us by playing. We sang, we laughed and ended the day with smiles on our faces and very happy memories. We hope to return to Naxos and plan a longer trip on the Danae with this fantastic crew.

Perfect Hotel in Surreal Surroundings,"Communication was great throughout the research, questions and confirmations. Then we arrived. Pulling up to Archontiko Mesochori put a smile my face, as I chose the location for our small group. We were all in awe of the surrounding beauty but also very happy with the hotel. We were greeted warmly and given a map and area information as we checked in. Both rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. The views from the rooms and especially the garden are amazing. We sat outside and enjoyed a glass of wine and the view before exploring Meteora just before sunset. It took only minutes to stand on the rocks over looking all of the monasteries. Perfect location. In the morning we met our guide at the Holy Monastery of Great Meteoron, again only minutes from our hotel. After our day at Meteora we returned to Athens and I was sad not to return to Archontiko Mesochori.

The entire area looks surreal and quietly beautiful, the history and architecture are truly fascinating. We had one day there and spent it with an excellent tour guide.

First of all, the ambiance was inviting, comfortable and lovely. We had a table beneath the tree. Wine, starters, entrees and dessert were absolutely wonderful and delicious. Even better was the service. They were professional, friendly and humorous.

(My route took me through rolling green fields covered with sheep. I loved it!) It was a wonderful surprise to find the Sneem Hotel modern and yet still inviting. The staff was professional and friendly. The attention to detail was appreciated. The rooms were spacious, very clean and comfortable.

The Best Night in Cork,"My husband and I only had a few days in Cork to explore and get to know the city. As fate would have it, I saw a poster for the show within hours of arriving. We checked the reviews and immediately booked online for the following night. The pub is the perfect venue, historic and charming. The food was tasty and plentiful. And the show was absolutely fantastic! The writing, acting and singing were witty and brilliant. These talented actors shared heartbreaking history with accuracy, respect along with laughter, whenever appropriate. When we weren't laughing we were moved by the telling of a story and throughout the evening we were learning. (Mostly there was laughter.) We sat with four charming ladies from Cork who enjoyed the show immensely. It really was the best night in Cork.

A Very Happy Surprise,"While traveling by car from Detroit to Chicago I searched TripAdvisor for a restaurant that would make everyone happy. This is no easy feat, especially as one friend is an owner of a successful restaurant. I found several options in Chesterton but kept returning to Third Coast Spice Café. I'm so glad I did. Every one of us enjoyed the delicious food, the quality ingredients and the thoughtful preparation of each meal. Our server, Joe, was knowledgeable, professional and very patient with us as we asked our many questions. The entire staff was hard-working and personable. The Cafe has the feel of a diner but more welcoming with obvious thought put into the comfort of the customers (a children's table with toys and a nearby rocking chair). It's as if the owner took an average diner, imagined the potential and made it happen.

The first evening we both ordered the fried chicken, collard greens and red slaw. Delicious! For my second meal I chose the salmon with spicy coconut noodles and bok-choy.

Potentially Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at the Hotel Central Continental in Interlaken with a large group of friends. Everyone of us found the rooms to be comfortable and clean with spectacular views of the river and the Alps. The beds were comfortable, the shower pressure was good and the size of our rooms large. Overall the experience within our rooms was positive. It's true that you must lock your door with the key once in for the night (and not leave it in the keyhole, as this makes it simple to unlock from the outside). However, we did have someone unlock our door at 7:00 a.m. and begin to open it. When I called out they closed it and quickly left. Though it was too early, I assumed it was housekeeping. After hearing about stories of theft from others in our group I began to reconsider.

This hotel is beautifully situated on a stretch of land in the middle of the Aare River. There is a terrace with a view of the Alps at the entrance and on the other side there are a collection of small bars attached to the hotel. The bars each have a different feel and seem okay. I didn't spend time there. Unfortunately, one person in our group had her wallet stolen while at one of these bars. You must be aware of your belongings at all times!

The public areas are spacious and comfortable, perhaps a little dusty but okay. The breakfast was fine. It was a very large spread but I only tried the meat, cheese & fruit. The coffee was strong and good. Our group was told we could only have breakfast after 9:00 a.m. which seemed odd considering some of our group were early risers and others not. The breakfast room was not busy so it wasn't a problem to go during any of the hours it was open.

The staff seemed pleasant but not terribly helpful. They had no information regarding visiting Jungfraujoch or other area attractions. When our group was told to wait for check-in because the rooms were not yet ready we waited an hour before one of us asked about the status of our rooms. The same woman who told us to wait and who had been standing there the entire time said they had been ready for sometime. Again, they were pleasant enough but didn't seem to want communicate with guests more than necessary.

I do not plan to return to Hotel Central Continental when next in Interlaken. However, if one is prepared and expectations are set accordingly, I believe one could enjoy their stay and most certainly the location.",September 2017,Hotel Central Continental,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1110491-d260827-Reviews-Hotel_Central_Continental-Unterseen_Interlaken_Bernese_Oberland_Canton_of_Bern.html,"Unterseen, Switzerland",hotels,3.0,3.0
Currently Disappointed,"We have visited Schloss Gerzen over the years when visiting friends who live nearby. During our visit in January 2017 we very much enjoyed our meal, the ambiance and a lovely tour of the Schloss. We returned with friends in September hoping to share the same wonderful experience, however, we were very disappointed. The service was was okay. Unfortunately, the menu changed and perhaps the kitchen staff also changed. No longer serving traditional Bavarian food, the kitchen struggled to serve a decent Italian meal. The pizza, ordered by three of the six in our group, was burnt and tasteless. I had the caprese salad which was flavorless and lacked freshness. There was one highlight, a few of us had the seasonal Kürbis Creme Suppe. It was delicious!

The staff was very pleasant and breakfast consisted of a good variety - eggs (scrambled & veggie omelets), sausage (pork links & turkey patties), cereals, pastries, yogurt, coffee, juice and more.

One Great Night of Sleep,"We arrived late in the evening and had to be 'buzzed' in which is common with extended stay hotels. This only took moments. After a long day of driving it was nice to be greeted with a smile. The public areas were clean and tidy. Our oom was next to the elevator but it was quiet. Everything was very clean and well equipped for an extended stay (full size refrigerator, stove top, dishwasher, microwave). The bed and linens were comfortable which made for a great night of sleep. This morning we found breakfast to have a good variety of well prepared items. As we left we were greeted by the front desk with another smile and a sincere inquiry regarding our stay. We told the gentleman we enjoyed it and wouldn't change a thing.",December 2017,Staybridge Suites Elkhart North,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g37085-d1465035-Reviews-Staybridge_Suites_Elkhart_North-Elkhart_Indiana.html,"Elkhart, Indiana",hotels,5.0,4.0
Fantastic Memorable Experience!,"When friends ask about my trip to Europe my immediate response is to tell them about my paragliding experience. It was absolutely amazing! The entire staff was professional and friendly. Luki, my pilot, explained everything I needed to know and then after we took off he pointed out the sites. Luki made me feel comfortable from take off to the high five on the ground. People ask if it was scary. Not all all! If I would have had more time in Interlaken I would've done it again in a heartbeat. I happily recommend paragliding with this great company.",September 2017,Twin Paragliding,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1803604-d2664442-Reviews-Twin_Paragliding-Matten_bei_Interlaken_Interlaken_Bernese_Oberland_Canton_of_Ber.html,"Matten bei Interlaken, Switzerland",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Great Hotel, Great Price & Happy Stay","Colorado Springs hotels are normally on the high side regardless of season. It's a fantastic destination with an insane amount of things to do and see so it's understandable. When we found the BW Plus near the AFA, saw the great rates and read the reviews we decided to try it. I'm so glad we did. The entire staff (front desk, housekeeping and breakfast staff...all) is truly impressive with their professionalism and friendliness. I'm very impressed with management as it is clear that customer service is a top priority. The rooms are very clean, the beds are comfortable and the shower is all one would want and more after a very long drive. I'm sitting in the breakfast area as I write this review and the staff taking care of the breakfast area has taken a moment to check with everyone to make sure they've had enough to eat and if there's anything else they'd like before they clean up. They made sure to let everyone know they are welcome to stay. It's 945a, fifteen minutes after breakfast ends. (Many times at other hotels the vacuum starts precisely at the end of breakfast to tell everyone it's time to finish and leave.) And still, this staff is walking through to make sure everyone is happy and if they'd like more coffee. I can't say enough positive words about the entire staff and this property. I have absolutely no negative comments. We enjoyed our stay here and will recommend this hotel to everyone!",December 2017,Best Western Plus Peak Vista Inn & Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33364-d224983-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_Peak_Vista_Inn_Suites-Colorado_Springs_El_Paso_County_Colorado.html,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",hotels,5.0,4.5
A FUN & Memorable Day,"From the moment Captain Paul responded to my inquiry to the end of the day when he shook my hand, he was a pleasure to work with and very professional. He and Pete made sure we were comfortable and immediately we felt at home. The boat was tidy, spacious and offered both shade and sun. We saw dolphins throughout the day as we made our way to Sanibel Island to enjoy the beach, shelling and snorkeling. After returning to the boat some of us relaxed and enjoyed the sunshine while others fished with great success! A nine foot sawfish was caught and released. It was amazing to see one up close! With or without the sawfish the entire day was amazing. Thanks to Captain Paul and Pete we had a very fun and memorable day.",October 2017,Captain Paul's Yacht Charters,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34118-d2074277-Reviews-Captain_Paul_s_Yacht_Charters-Cape_Coral_Florida.html,"Cape Coral, Florida",attractions,5.0,5.0
The Old Drury Still Great,"If you've ever stayed at a Drury Inn over the last twenty years you'll immediately recognize this property. Which can be comforting since Drury offers an excellent product. The lobby, public areas and rooms have been updated and are pleasant. The rooms are clean and spacious and the bed is very comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was great with a good variety of breakfast items. Above all, the customer service and their professionalism and friendliness made the experience happy from beginning to end.",May 2017,Pear Tree Inn Sikeston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g44912-d96314-Reviews-Pear_Tree_Inn_Sikeston-Sikeston_Missouri.html,"Sikeston, Missouri",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent BW,"Growing up my parents had a Best Western Hotels book so we always knew where the next BW was on our roadtrip. Through the years some BWs were not regularly updated and the property lost it's great reputation. However, it seems over the last ten years there's been a ton of remodeling, branding, marketing and the name is once again a name you can count on for quality. The BW Butterfield Inn is one such property. It looks and feels like a new property. Very clean, spacious rooms with comfortable beds provide everything you need for a good night's sleep. Breakfast was good and definitely met expectations. And the front desk staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel is an excellent choice whether staying for one night or for a week.",May 2017,Best Western Plus Butterfield Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g38771-d1163869-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_Butterfield_Inn-Hays_Kansas.html,"Hays, Kansas",hotels,5.0,4.5

Impressive Menu,"Rick's on Main is situated in a charming, historical building in a charming, historical village. The menu offers a wide variety of interesting (in a good way) food. The list of specials was long and everything sounded great. Our server, Babs, (who was excellent) answered all of our questions and explained the chef would be happy to accommodate special diets. We all decided on salads, all different, all delicious. The food and service were well above my expectations and the experience was very enjoyable. I look forward to my next meal at Rick's.",April 2017,Rick's On Main,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47619-d910363-Reviews-Rick_s_On_Main-East_Aurora_New_York.html,"East Aurora, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Favorite Store,"When walking into Vidler's from Main Street one would expect to run into Andy and Opey Taylor and the others from The Andy Griffith Show. East Aurora has always been reminiscent of Mayberry and Vidler's is one of the main reasons. Vidler's not only has old fashioned candy, retro games and toys, it has nearly every gift, craft and kitchen gadget imaginable. While there a huge variety there is still charm. It a must if you're visiting WNY. Just keep in mind during holidays and some summer weekends it can be very busy. People who grew up in the area love to share this special place with their family and friends. Try to visit first thing in the morning, as soon as they open.
