The food and wine was amazing!,The food and wine was amazing! One of our favourite restaurants in the city. Great atmosphere and the staff are all lovely!! Would strongly recommend that you eat here and bring all your friends and family!,July 2020,Pinocchios Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186342-d733304-Reviews-Pinocchios_Restaurant-Norwich_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Norwich, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Awful. Would not recommend,"The outside is lovely but the inside is dated and dirty. From the minute we arrived the receptionist was rude and unhelpful.

The table service system does not work and we waited 25 minutes to even be offered a menu and drink. We then had to wait another 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order. Everyone else kept going up to the bar to ask for service and was told to wait for table service. We then got given the incorrect order and had to wait another 25 minutes. Food was mediocre.

The room was dirty and had two single beds pushed together. This was not what we booked. We requested a refund and left the hotel. We were not once asked why and the staff made no effort to try to resolve our dissatisfaction. Poor service throughout.",July 2020,Dunston Hall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1599537-d191755-Reviews-Dunston_Hall-Stoke_Holy_Cross_Norwich_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html,"Stoke Holy Cross, United Kingdom",hotels,1.0,3.5
Dinner date!,"Lovely restaurant! Great atmosphere and the staff were nice! Quick service! Highly recommend the antipasti board to start with, steak for main and a bottle of Chianti to wash it down !",December 2018,Portofinos Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186394-d2109059-Reviews-Portofinos_Restaurant-Newcastle_upon_Tyne_Tyne_and_Wear_England.html,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
"Perfect location, would deffo stay again","Stayed here for 4 nights. Perfect location, close to all the main attractions in Athens and all the shops. Nearby supermarkets and lots of bars and restaurants. The rooftop bar has an amazing view. We enjoyed a bottle of local wine and a cheese board whilst watching the sunset and the acropolis light up. Breakfast is very good and the mini bar prices are fair. Only negatives are that we asked for a double bed and got two singles on wheels, and you could not leave the air con on all day. It only comes on when your card is in the slot and if you leave one of your cards in so that the room is cool for your return the maid takes it out!! (Very hot)",July 2018,Athens Cypria Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d235722-Reviews-Athens_Cypria_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0

Trip with boyfriend,"Someone recommended this place to us and we are so glad! Really lovely inside and the cheese and ham platters were delicious. Top notch wine and the Italian waiter was very helpful and attentive. If you love cheese and wine, this is place to go. We booked the day before. Prices are standard as in there are some cheaper bottles and very expensive ones. (2012 red is the best)",June 2018,Le Wine Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187079-d1838773-Reviews-Le_Wine_Bar-Bordeaux_Gironde_Nouvelle_Aquitaine.html,"Bordeaux, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
