Avoid at all costs.,"I was inadvertently transferred to Cape Air when a United flight caused me to miss my original flight with Seaborne Air (another loser airline). The Cape Air flight was on a Cessna 8 seater where the noise level was unbearable. They didn't have my luggage to put on my flight but assured me it would be on the flight leaving 20 minutes later. Surprise....no luggage arrived. In St. Croix they put in a search but with very little help. Trips to the airport and calls yielded nothing. My luggage was brought to my hotel FOUR days after my arrival, late in the evening. The bag had clearly been ransacked and items stolen. Their level of concern regarding my missing luggage was zero. Avoid this airline at all costs.",May 2019,Cape Air,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729044-Reviews-Cape-Air,World,flights,1.0,3.5
"After seeing the Acropolis, not to be missed","You could probably spend a whole day here looking at all the antiquities. Our tour guide knew which highlights to show us, so we went through it in a couple of hours. But not be missed after your visit to the Acropolis.",August 2018,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Time travelling,Words really can't describe walking through this ancient city. We were lucky enough to have I-Pads which were provided by our tour guide that showed locations in 3-D as to how they would have looked thousands of years ago.

Jaw dropping,"Ok, I've seen ruins, but this was an experience that so far topped anything I'd seen before. An ancient city that is only partially uncovered that is beyond anything you've seen. Walking the ancient stones and hearing the tour guide tell the story behind everything made it an experience of a lifetime.",August 2018,Ancient City of Ephesus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293976-d548950-Reviews-Ancient_City_of_Ephesus-Selcuk_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Selcuk, Turkey",attractions,5.0,5.0
Awesome,"We visited the cave where St. John received the Book of Revelation in the Bible. Whether you're a believer or not, one can't help but be moved by the location and the story told by the tour guide. Then you go up to the monastery and see the ancient frescoes and the attached museum. And as you walk down the hill after the visit there are cafes and shops to meander in. Truly a wonderful afternoon.",August 2018,Monastery of St. John,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189447-d207187-Reviews-Monastery_of_St_John-Patmos_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Pátmos, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Truly stunning!,"This hotel was planned for us by a tour group and it was truly top of the line. The rooms were impeccably clean and kept that way by a wonderful, friendly staff. The roof of the hotel had stunning views of the Acropolis, as well as a top notch restaurant and a pool. The food was excellent and the morning breakfast with so much to choose from was out of this world.

"If you're looking for a simple, nice place right on the water....","I've been coming to this hotel since 1985 (when it was first called The Kind Frederik), and I keep returning to this spot in St. Croix. Friends keep asking me why I don't try other places. And it's simply because I don't get a chance to take a vacation like this more than once a year, and instead of risking being disappointed somewhere that I've never been (which has happened), I return to the place where I reach absolute states of bliss. And it's exactly what I'm looking for.

I like to be right on the water, so that I can get up at 7 am and start my day swimming. If you're the kind of person who enjoys being near the water on your vacation, this is the place to be. The hotel is very simple, the rooms vary in size, some with terraces, some not, some with kitchens, some not. It is very well-kept, the grounds are full of different kinds of foliage and the ambience is total laid back.

Frederiksted is a sleepy little town and so far has avoided the development that so many other places have. To me, that's a major plus. Again, this might not be for everyone, but for me it's what I want. The people are friendly for the most part. And again, you have a beautiful beach to walk on, and if you're into swimming and snorkeling, you'll be pleased.

I've found that a rental car is a pretty handy thing to have, to go exploring other parts of the island, to go out to dinner and to go to the store. I've gone with friends, family and even by myself and always felt comfortable.

I highly recommend Sand Castle on the Beach.",May 2014,Sand Castle on the Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147403-d147692-Reviews-Sand_Castle_on_the_Beach-Frederiksted_St_Croix_U_S_Virgin_Islands.html,St. Croix,hotels,5.0,4.5
For an excellent flavorful meal....,"This restaurant is right next door to Sand Castle on the Beach and has never disappointed. The food is out of this world, and if you're into well prepared, fresh sea food, look no further.

Five stars from me!",May 2014,Beach Side Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147403-d1046587-Reviews-Beach_Side_Cafe-Frederiksted_St_Croix_U_S_Virgin_Islands.html,St. Croix,restaurants,5.0,4.5
