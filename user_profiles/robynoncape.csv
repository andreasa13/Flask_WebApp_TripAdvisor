Challenging and Fun!,"We loved this experience! We were a group of 3 adults and 2 15 years old boys. It was challenging, clean, with professional guides, but we were not successful. Unknowingly we chose the most challenging adventure. I would love to try it again the next time I am in Columbia.",January 2020,Escapology Columbia (Vista),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g54184-d13279738-Reviews-Escapology_Columbia_Vista-Columbia_South_Carolina.html,"Columbia, South Carolina",attractions,5.0,5.0
Breathtaking history and views in one location,"We were lucky enough to go to the Acropolis twice during our visit. The first day was sunny and beautiful and seeing each piece still there the Parthenon, the Propylaia
the Erechtheion, and The Temple of Athena Nike just to name the most famous. And then imagining all the pieces missing, the sixth Caryatid waiting to come home and join the others in the Acropolis Museum, and The Old Temple which you can see outlines of, but can only imagine what it once looked like. As we were exploring a storm came in and washed us literally off the Acropolis, but it just added to our adventure.

Our last day in Greece, we went back in the morning, it was gray and dreary, but we took pictures that turned out to be amazingly beautiful. I am not a photographer but the light appears to have been perfect for the pictures. It actually snowed while we were at the top! Be prepared to walk, hike, scramble, and in some places climb a little, and it can be like walking on ice when it rains, but it is truly an awe inspiring site/sight.",December 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Fun, surprising, delicious, interesting food","We found this restaurant through our TripAdvisor searching and had a wonderful late lunch here. We are a party of 5 and everyone loved their dinner. It is a fun place but be prepared to view the food cooked that day and pick your dish, there is no menu. Food was very inexpensive for the quality we got. We tried to go back but there are so many good choices we just never made it, we will have to go back to Greece to go again.",December 2019,To Kati Allo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2108580-Reviews-To_Kati_Allo-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Cozy, comfortable, delicious, and fun","We came here by accident, exactly the way you should not, by someone drawing us in. We are so glad we allowed ourselves to be seated. This became our home away from home. We would meet there, and end up staying for hours. The food was outstanding, every dish, except the cheeseburger, it was good but my husband was too funny being mad at himself, (the cheeseburger was good, but not like the other dishes.) asking why did I order a cheeseburger? He kept trying to eat everyone else's food. We loved everything else we had. The wine was nice and the small add-ons were fun and interesting each time. The staff were fun and attentive, their sense of humor really added to our enjoyment of our meal. And like every great place they remembered us and actually sat us at the same table every time, it made us feel special and that we belonged, while just being tourists. The wifi is great and free. But again, the food was outstanding.",December 2019,Elaea Mezedadiko,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10587843-Reviews-Elaea_Mezedadiko-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
This site was intense for its sense of history and scale,"We were lucky enough to go on two days during our trip. The first day it was sunny and gorgeous and then the rain crashed down on us. We saw everything and in two very dramatic moods. Please be careful of any water though, it is very slippery due stones that have been worn over millennia. The second day it actually snowed! It was beautiful and our pictures on this day are actually better than on the sunny day. Be prepared to walk, and walk a lot, and all of it up hill, but the views and the grandeur are well worth the effort.",December 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Amazing museum design and artifacts,"It was moving to see the history of the Acropolis as you move through the building. The archaeological site it is built on is view-able through the floors so you have this feeling of looking through time as you climb through the building. The lack of appreciation for the Parthenon in situ and the mistakes made to ""preserve"" it and ""save"" it are heartbreaking. It is amazing what the Greek people have been able to recreate and manage the future better for the Acropolis buildings.",December 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Such a fun and delicious experience!,"We were a group of 5 age 15 to 61 and everyone enjoyed this experience. The tour of the market place is not for the faint of heart but the educational tidbits and the real world experience was fantastic. After our trip through the market we went back to the kitchen and made our food. So fun working with all the other participants and our own family to make the dolmades, moussaka, eggplant in sauce, tzatziki and orange pie. Although we had two were were not fans of spinach or eggplant, they both ate and enjoyed the food. Vasia's sense of humor and obvious flare for performing added a great sense of joy to the experience. Our only regret was not doing it earlier in the trip so we could have done more cooking while we were there using ingredients from the market.",December 2019,Athens 4-Hour Cooking Class with Central Market Visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d12943111-Athens_4_Hour_Cooking_Class_with_Central_Market_Visit-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
"The wine was amazing, and our sculptures actually looked like sculptures!","This was an incredible experience from start to finish. We tried three different wines and enjoyed all three! The food was delicious and fun to try everything served. In addition, our sculpture experience exceeded my expectations by actually looking like sculptures. Manos and his father (also an artist) were fun and informative. We learned quite a bit from them about the wine making process and sculpting, and Greek history and culture both ancient and modern. We were a group of 5 and aged 15 to 61, all of us loved this experience.",December 2019,"VIP cultural and theme tour, including winetasting and sculpting lessons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g262046-d17472800-VIP_cultural_and_theme_tour_including_winetasting_and_sculpting_lessons-Kallithea_.html,"Kallithea, Greece",activities,5.0,5.0
