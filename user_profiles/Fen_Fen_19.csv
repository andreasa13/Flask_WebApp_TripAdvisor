Dinner,"Came here twice for dinner. We liked it for it’s moderately priced food, friendly Owner, well executed home style cooking and it’s very close to Acropolis metro station. The stew beef (beef kokonista?) was very nice. We are Asian so we really liked the fact that they serve rice here.",October 2019,To Kati Allo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2108580-Reviews-To_Kati_Allo-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Huge bakery,This is a good place for tourists to drop by to get breakfasts/ snacks on the go. Huge selection and freshly baked goods on display. You can opt to dine upstairs too. We bought some sort of cookies (by weight) which we eat on the go and it was very much to our liking as it was not very sweet nor was it oily.,October 2019,Veneti Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d9459153-Reviews-Veneti_Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Open 24 hours,We like it because it is open 24 hours. Came twice to buy bread. Selection is definitely lesser late at night but the fact that it is open 24 hours is good. Good service too.,October 2019,Attica Artopoieia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12962864-Reviews-Attica_Artopoieia-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Must eat top cream,We were in Athens for 4 days and stopped here twice to eat the yoghurt with honey and top cream with honey. Both are delicious but my favorite is the top cream. I can eat this every day!,October 2019,Stani,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2454425-Reviews-Stani-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Beautiful monastery,Beautiful monastery. The steps that run up to the monastery is scenic and shady. Clean toilet halfway up the steps too. You can see that this monastery is well taken care of by the nuns. Potted flowers everywhere. I like their little souvenir shop inside. Bought 1 tin can of wild olive oil. Have yet to open. The only thing that I think that will improve my visit if the monastery were to open up more spaces for visitors.,October 2019,Roussanou Monastery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315843-d243299-Reviews-Roussanou_Monastery-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Morning hiking tour,"We have no regret joining this our. Our guide, Chris, was very professional yet friendly. He is also an expert in hiking. The hike was a tad fast paced for me (probably because i am short and don't exercise enough) but i have no problem catching up. Given a choice, i will join again in future if i visit Meteora again as regular tourists will have difficulty finding the trails to go up to the rocks. The hike was beautiful and the angle for photos will be different from those you can take from the roads.",October 2019,Meteora Hike with Transport from Kalambaka,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g315843-d11454230-Meteora_Hike_with_Transport_from_Kalambaka-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",activities,4.0,5.0
Rented for 24 hours,"Sophia was great! She was very flexible with tourists needs. We rented a 125cc motorbike from her for 24 hours and had no problem. Helmets were provided free. It is fine to walk in Kalambaka but Meteora is another thing altogether. If you are just a regular tourist, it is recommended to get your own transportation to visit the Rocks. Advantage being that you can be one of the first to reach the Rocks in the morning and the last to leave it in the evening.",October 2019,Meteora Bike Rentals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315843-d7056012-Reviews-Meteora_Bike_Rentals-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",attractions,4.0,5.0
Good for people with limited time,"We joined the sunset tour and the tour with drive past all monasteries. We went into 2 monasteries and view the sunset from the observation point meant for sunset. THe sunset was glorious with all the rocks in the background. So for those with limited time in Meteora, sunset tour (in my opinion) is a good choice.",October 2019,Majestic Sunset on Meteora Rocks Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g315843-d11476290-Majestic_Sunset_on_Meteora_Rocks_Tour-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",activities,4.0,5.0
Great sandals,"I had a pair of gladiator sandal made and i am sure I will love it. Oligiana (the owner) was super friendly and I would recommend her shop because she loves what she is doing and she puts love and dedication to the sandals that she is making. There are tons on much cheaper sandals sold everywhere but a custom made pair will definitely fit better than mass produced ones because our left and right foot is different and a mass produced pair won't be able to self adjust to it automatically.

In case you guys are wondering why i have yet to wear it, I am still recovering from a sprained ankle.",October 2019,Olgianna Melissinos Sandals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12672130-Reviews-Olgianna_Melissinos_Sandals-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Dinner,The food is pretty average. The Greek salad was prepared ahead in bulk so we didn't quite like it. We had,October 2019,O Thanasis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d929471-Reviews-O_Thanasis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Beautiful museum,A really beautiful museum worth going once in a lifetime. We spent about 3 hours and I think it was worth it.,October 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
A majestic place but sooo crowded,Went end of October and it was still very crowded. Surprisingly hot as well. There is not mush shelter so apply enough sunscreen. Rocks on the ground were pretty slippery too. Sprained ankle is no joke.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Dinner,We ate there once during our 4 days trip to Athens and we would recommend others to try it out because we love the grilled meats and the Tsiknaboom salad. The owner really loves what he is doing which results in fantastic food. Menu is short so this means he really knows what he is doing and is doing it great. Price is affordable. We were the only tourists there that evening.,October 2019,TsiknaBoom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14283270-Reviews-TsiknaBoom-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Good and cheap,"The souvlaki is one of the cheapest we have eaten during our 10 days trip to Athens, Meteora and Hydra. It tasted just as nice as the rest of the souvlaki we have eaten too.",October 2019,Chicken Time Fast Food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315843-d8327433-Reviews-Chicken_Time_Fast_Food-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Excellent slow cooked meat,We ordered the lamb and beef cooked in wine. Both were excellent. Staffs were great too especially one of the young man whom were very patient with us as we were not familiar with European food.,October 2019,Meteora Restaurant Gkertsou Family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315843-d1553826-Reviews-Meteora_Restaurant_Gkertsou_Family-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Dinner,"Ordered the grilled chicken stuffed with cheese. Chicken breast lover will love it. If you are a chicken lover like us, it will just be average. Meaty and full though. We ordered the briam (slow cooked root veggies with tomato base?) was excellent.",October 2019,Taverna Panellinion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g315843-d1566335-Reviews-Taverna_Panellinion-Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kalambaka, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Love Taverna Gardenia,We loved the food. It looked simple but it was very nice. We ordered the Greek salad and the grilled chicken. Everything was very fresh and price was affordable. The owner was nice enough to offer us a home made pepper dip to go with the chicken and fries. It was fantastic! There was a complimentary slice of cake (Ravina?) for each of us too. Thank you.,October 2019,Taverna Gardenia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1070999-d2066604-Reviews-Taverna_Gardenia-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
