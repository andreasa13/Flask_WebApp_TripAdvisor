An Informal Ruth's Chris?,"On our anniversary trip to Asheville, we purposely packed our business casual clothes for our celebratory dinner at Ruth's Chris. Having dined in our local restaurant in the past, we were aware of the dress code and dared not go without dressing up a bit. We could have left those clothes at home as it was more of a come as you are restaurant; everything from suits (a few, not many) to shorts, jeans, mid-riff shirts, sneakers, etc. Doesn't impact the service we received (which was very good and nice to have our special occasion recognized) or the quality of the food. But again, the ambiance is a bit missing (including the valet staff, but hey I guess Asheville has a different vibe).

The petite fillets were done as ordered, sizzling in butter and a nice taste. The mash potato side was also tasty (enough to share). The only flop on the meal was the shoestring potatoes which were over cooked and overly crispy. But I ate them anyway.

Good bread and we appreciated the complimentary dessert (ice cream and a chocolate lava type cake; would have liked the apple crisp tart, but hey after spending $145 for the dinner not including tip, I won't complain on saving a few dollars).",April 2021,Ruth's Chris Steak House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60742-d2456500-Reviews-Ruth_s_Chris_Steak_House-Asheville_North_Carolina.html,"Asheville, North Carolina",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Grand Dame in Asheville,"Spent a nice midweek stay at this Grand Dame nestled above Asheville. This was our first visit and we were immediately taken with the view as you enter the property. It is imposing for sure. It is also a very busy property with people and cars coming and going. The front has a large porch area with rocking chairs so you can sit and enjoy the hustle and bustle.

The grand front lobby has plenty of sitting and plenty of people. You are immediate drawn to the back doors and the views from the back decks of the valley golf course and the waterfall in front of the Spa. It is a sight to behold. Note: the property is open to all so you'll see and hear a lot of tours being conducted for visitors.

Check in is at 4pm and I got the feel that early check in is not welcomed at all. You can call at the front desk, they will check you in however your room most likely won't be ready until 4. They will text you when you can come and pick up your key. That gives you some time to walk around and acquaint yourself with the shops and eateries, the sports complex, etc.

Our room was a standard room in the main lodge (room 555). True to our luck it was the room immediately by the elevator. On the plus side, the rooms re well insulated from the noise and other than the occasional loud guest and welcome/bye bye as people entered and departed the elevator (manned by an attendant, only two riders at a time), we heard very little noise.

The room is of good size, with a king bed, window overlooking the front of the lodge, four nice, soft pillows, plenty of storage (closet, built in draws, separate closet with ironing board, a good size bathroom, large TV with a very quiet mini-fridge in cabinet below, two armed chairs (a bit on the slender size for sitting) and desk. Two robes can be found in the closet (with a safe and key).

Bathroom had some signs of mold behind the sink faucets and the glass door to the tub/shower combo. The rubber molding for the shower glass opening was also coming off. Caution for those with some mobility issues, you may have trouble climbing into and out of the tub (it's deep and no real handles to steady yourself getting in and out). The shower had nice, constant pressure and an adjustable shower head. We were not able to redirect the water from shower to tub, so not sure if that was an issue with us or the facet. Had four nice and thick towels, a hair dryer and shampoo/soap/conditioner accessories.

We did not eat at the lodge (couldn't get reservations last minute). They offered us a free coffee from the marketplace but didn't use those coupons either.

Parking is at a premium if you self park (added charge per day). We ended up having to park near the sports complex and walk (hike) to up hill to the lodge each day. They do offer valet parking which takes most of the nearby spaces. Didn't appear they offered on property shuttle to the parking areas.

Overall was nice to spend our special anniversary occasion (not recognized in any way by the hotel) at the Lodge. I did use their onsite flower shop to order an arrangement which was delivered as promised.",April 2021,The Omni Grove Park Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60742-d93940-Reviews-The_Omni_Grove_Park_Inn-Asheville_North_Carolina.html,"Asheville, North Carolina",hotels,4.0,4.5

Those donuts are big,"Stopped by after reading some reviews in anticipation of some great donuts on our recent trip to Asheville. First impression was, wow those are some big donuts. We ordered two Vortex doughnuts (cinnamon sprinkled with a drizzle of chocolate) and one chocolate covered; a small (12oz) drip coffee and one hot chocolate (whole milk).

The pros: those are some big doughnuts and they looked good.

The cons: those big doughnuts has no taste whatsoever. The coffee was terrible (wife actually tossed hers out) and like the donuts the hot chocolate had very little taste to it.

Yeast based, these are light and chewy. I love chocolate but there was no taste to this these. Exceptionally disappointing.

Excellent Lunch,"Pleasantly surprised when we stopped in for lunch. First the basket of fried pork rinds were fantastic and addictive. The service was attentive and pleasant. For lunch we ordered a seafood platter with shrimp and scallops panned fried. Excellent, moist and well seasoned. Fries were wonderful (coated and crunchy). The cocktail sauce was superb. Wife had the shrimp croissant sandwich which was also fantastic (maybe a bit too much onion but otherwise top notch).",March 2021,19 Degrees North Seafood and Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34882-d15122317-Reviews-19_Degrees_North_Seafood_and_Grill-Dahlonega_Georgia.html,"Dahlonega, Georgia",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Disappointing,"Attended here with a large party and unfortunately the food disappointed. The service did not and was top notch. Our server did an amazing job.

So the food. We started with their pretzel. It was ok, could have used a bit more salt and wasn't a big fan of the butter slathered on top (my fault, I should have asked for it not to be put on). For my main, I ordered the wurst sampler substituting another weisswurst for the garlic bratwurst. So it was two weisswurst, a knackwurst and double sauerkraut. I'm seldom disappointed with wurst and love weisswurst. This was by far some of the worse wurst I've had. The weisswurst were grilled, not boiled and were overcooked. The knackwurst was good. The sauerkraut was by far the worse I've ever had in a restaurant. It had little taste and what taste it had was almost inedible. Having lived in Germany and visited many times, I'm love my wurst and sauerkraut. This was not one of those good experiences. Wife had the chicken 'schnitzel' which was a good portion though more like a fried chicken cutlet than a schnitzel. Her red cabbage on the other hand was very good. For dessert, tried the strudel.

A little on the dated side in a very touristy town,"Definitely not the cheapest hotel in town in a very touristy town. Stayed two nights in the tower suite (room 333) as it looked to be a little bit out of the norm than normal rooms. Kind of a mix bag for the money so here are the pros/cons

Pros: at the top of the tower, there's no noise coming from the rooms below (good separation) and no one on your sides. Though the hotel does allow pets in some of their rooms and we had a large dog somewhere near us that barked occasionally.

The room is large enough with steps separating the living/kitchen area and the bed/bath.

Plenty of lights and plenty of windows.

Location is good, though be prepared the hotel is close to the several fest halls with one being just next door so you will hear the music from there until they shut down. There's also a lot of road noise with a lot of motorcyclist revving up and down the main strip.

Cons:

Dated, very dated. The room could use a lot of freshening up (new paint would be a good start as the walls are marked up a lot).

The two arm chairs are not comfortable (hard)

The mattress and pillows are very, very hard. Mattress is thin. (Hard is kind of a theme here).

Shower: while the water temp was good, the pressure was anemic.

Overall, for two nights it was fine. Unfortunately during this pandemic time, we could not partake in their breakfast (they did provide a 'bag' breakfast with your choice of prepackaged pastry, a small carton of juice and a breakfast bar - the bare necessities). And daily housekeeping was not provided unless by request.",March 2021,Helendorf River Inn and Conference Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g35004-d120657-Reviews-Helendorf_River_Inn_and_Conference_Center-Helen_Georgia.html,"Helen, Georgia",hotels,3.0,4.5
Best Donuts Anywhere and the Breakfast is good,"I love donuts and specifically chocolate covered donuts. Hofer's has the very best donuts I've ever had. My only regret is I didn't buy more. Now my wife would say that the apple fritters are better and got to admit they were very good (she was kind enough to share part of hers). And while I'm on it, the cinnamon twist donut was fresh and delicious. So got to say, you can't miss on this place to fulfill your donut and pastry needs. We also ate breakfast here (go early, the line gets long just after opening). I enjoyed their Belgium waffle with a side of ham. Wife had their French toast. Both were outstanding.",March 2021,Hofer's of Helen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35004-d528199-Reviews-Hofer_s_of_Helen-Helen_Georgia.html,"Helen, Georgia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Worth Trying,"After eating at another popular restaurant in Helen, we decided to try out Old Heidelberg one night and were glad we did. Arriving just before 7pm, we were promptly seated inside and the wait staff was very attentive (to the point they turned the fan off above us as it was a bit too much for our liking). The food here is a hit. We ordered the Wurst sampler (three sausages) with a double order of sauerkraut; a large pretzel; and a bowl of their Goulash soup. The three wurst were grilled perfectly, not overcooked. The sauerkraut was on the better side with bits of ham and on the mild side, but not too mild. We asked the they not put the herb butter on our pretzel which I believe made it more akin to what you get in Germany and was nicely done. Goulash was a hit with my wife with large chunks of meat and the broth was very tasty. Even had spazi. This will be our go to restaurant for dinner when we're next in the area.",March 2021,Old Heidelberg German Restaurant & Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35004-d4438062-Reviews-Old_Heidelberg_German_Restaurant_Pub-Helen_Georgia.html,"Helen, Georgia",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Great setting, Good food","Took advantage of their early bird specials and glad we did to beat the crowds. Overlooking the bay, the scenery is what you would expect and want in a Florida restaurant. For dinner, we ordered the Sea Bass Fish and Chips for me and the coconut shrimp for my wife. The fish and chips were ok. Portion was large. Fish was a bit too 'fishy' for me (would prefer cod). Coconut shrimp was excellent (also a large portion). Did order the shrimp cocktail and it was loaded with medium size shrimp. Bread was served upon request.

"That ""Florida"" Feel","A perfect day for outdoor sitting topped off with good food and killer dessert. Our first visit and the lunch fare was very good. Two of us had their classic burgers with fries. The burgers were hand patted, cooked to order and the pickles tasted like homemade. Great taste and large. Fries were great. Our party also ordered the BLFGT their signature sandwich. It was good, not great. The fried green tomato could have been left in the fryer for a bit more. Also had the southwest chicken wrap which was good, though messy (dripping sauces and ended up just unwrapping and eating. It's on the spicy side so beware. For dessert we had two of their specialty sundaes (one caramel, one brownie) and a separate bowl of ice cream.

"Good, Nothing Special","Was ready for a great ice cream treat, but alas, it appears to be just another ice cream shoppe (albeit no a lot of competition on the island) that serves ready made (not homemade). Adult size scoop is large and kid size while a bit smaller, would suffice for most people. Mint chocolate chip had a slight chalky aftertaste (probably due to the brand they use).",October 2020,Aunt Ebby's Ice Cream,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34602-d1080512-Reviews-Aunt_Ebby_s_Ice_Cream-St_George_Island_Florida.html,"St. George Island, Florida",restaurants,3.0,4.5

A Hidden Gem in a sea of seafood restaurants,"When you've had your fill of seafood, try this hidden gem serving excellent Italian fare. The menu is limited but there's something for everyone. The portions are large and the staff is friendly. Right now the hours are also limited so good to call ahead especially during times of high influx of tourists (like us).

Our order consisted of Chicken Alfredo (for wife) and their Spaghetti with Meatball (large meatball). The entrees came with a house salad (leafy greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, cranberries (nice and plump) and walnuts. You can ask them to hold any of the adds if you don't like them. Bread (baguette ) is served as well.

The Alfredo was excellent with its wide egg noodles cooked al dente. The spaghetti with it's home-made red sauce was also delicious.

Skipped dessert as we were stuffed.

Had half a chicken (leg, wing, thigh and breast) all fried to perfection with a slightly seasoned covering. Yum. Ate them all. Fries and rice are my sides but didn't eat many of the fries as I was stuffed from the chicken Didn't touch the rice. Had their fried pickles as an appetizer.

Average but perhaps it's what we ordered,"Didn't go for the BBQ (which may be what sets this apart). Dropped in for lunch and service was good and friendly. Had their fried shrimp basket with fries.

High Expectations. So So Donuts,"Oh how I wish the donuts lived up to all the hype I heard. Are they good? Yes. Are they great? Well not really, but they are good. These are cake donuts where one size fits all with difference being the toppings. No novelty donuts like bear claws or twists and certainly not the Krispy Kreme style.

Worthy of Lunch,"Asked a local for a recommendation for lunch and this was not it (in fact was told it was overpriced and they add a surcharge due to the pandemic). But after looking at several other places, we at here anyway. It was better than expected and given prices in this touristy area, didn't find it overpriced. Plus didn't see a surcharge our bill.

The order: Wife had the fish sandwich lunch special (grilled, you can get fried or blackened) with potato salad and fries. The fish (grouper I believe) was a nice size, fried well on a bun and was very tasty. Topped only by the potato salad which she rated as excellent (and she knows here potato salad). Fries were better than other places we've eaten in lately so all told this was a winner at $12.99

My order was the fried shrimp basket with fries. After sending it back once, they brought me fish, not shrimp, all was well. Basked was a dozen large (and I'm talking big, fat and juicy) lightly breaded and lightly fried shrimp. Fantastic. Again with fries but to be honest, couldn't eat all the fries or even half. Price $14.99

Dessert: piece of key lime for me (just so so and rather skinny slice) and a piece of coconut pie for my wife, which she rated very good.

Two soft drinks.

All orders were taken at the counter. No table service (they call your number, you pick it up in disposable containers).

Great Food with the convenience of delivery,"As we are under a stay in place order and couldn't go out for an anniversary dinner, we took this occasion to order from Stevarinos and take advantage of their delivery service. Glad we did. While not the overly romantic dinner we envisioned, the food was every bit as good as the reviews we read. Order consisted of the Monterey Chicken with potatoes and pasta salad (excellent) and a medium Dublin Pizza (also excellent). Were surprised that a mini-loaf of bread was included. The pizza was enough for two meals and the meats were piled high (almost too high). Crust was wonderful.

New Upscaled Dining in Economy a fail,"First experience with the upgraded economy class dining on some of their international routes and honestly there are some nice touches (menu and disposable place mats) but in the end it's all about the food and it remains as inedible as before.

We were in row 31 and by the time they got to us, they were out of the shrimp appetizer (as the attendant said, they run out of those by the sixth row - well perhaps they should learn something and plan for more). The entrees were terrible and even the roll was hard. Best think was the ice cream. So good try Delta, but still a long way to go. Will continue to bring my snacks in fear of starving.

Seats were pretty good. Entertainment was good. Bathrooms were filthy (not Delta's fault but passengers are just pigs when they get in the air - would be nice if Delta cleaned them occasionally though).

Our First Experience,Overall had a very good experience flying Aegean for the first time. Check in was relatively easy though a bit confusing as the instructions at the check-in kiosk indicated I first had to pay for bags then come back and check in. The ticket agent took care of taking both my money for the checked bag and the overall check in. The boarding area was a bit crowded and hard to hear the announcements but we followed the crowd. A bit surprised that they boarded (for economy class) the window and middle seats before the aisle seats. Hadn't seen that in any other airline we've flown. No big deal other than the little added stress of no overhead room for your carry-on. Service was good and no issues there.

All about the view,"Situated above the town of Delphi, the views from this hotel are to die for. The hotel itself is nice and caters to tours (such as ours). The road to the hotel is windy and just hope you don't run into a bus. Our room on the third floor was nice and clean. Had good heat both in the room and in the bathroom (a rarity on our trip). The shower unfortunately is a bit awkward with the hand held shower but that's typical of these older hotels that adapt a hand held shower to what was just a bathtub. The bed was good (not too hard) but the pillows were rock hard. The breakfast buffet was limited and was so disappointed with the orange juice (from concentrate and weak, after having fresh in most hotels and all restaurants it was a let down). The hotel offered a welcome drink (non-alcoholic cherry drink) which was refreshing and sweet. We had a set menu dinner in the hotel which was good, not great.",February 2020,Hotel Apollonia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189408-d556937-Reviews-Hotel_Apollonia-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.0
It's Not all About the Views,"The views are undoubtedly fantastic, but there's so much more to this hotel than that. The rooms are wonderful and not your usual hotel room. Ours was located on the same floor as reception and were quite surprised when we entered and saw the layout included a sunken seating area along with a wonderful balcony overlooking the pool. The decor is modern. Bathroom was large and has an interesting window between it and the bedroom (not to worry has a shade that can be drawn). The bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows. The sitting area had a nice two person couch, table and solo seat. On the down side, the design is not conducive to heating the place due to it's split level. Very quiet location but not convenient to town. The buffet breakfast was standard though we had a good meal in the hotel restaurant. Wonderful shower (one of the best we had on our tour) though not a fan of the half glass enclosure. Super clean.

Best in the Area,"Our tour group stayed nearby and this was one of the few restaurant options available in the area from what we could see. So we ate here twice and both times were pleased with the food and the price. For our first dinner, our mains included the grill plate for one (very good and plenty of food, couple pieces of grilled chicken, half a sausage, hamburger (minced meat, not a fan), pork chop and bacon) plus fries of course, and the chicken schnitzel with cheese. The cheese on the schnitzel overwhelmed the dish and ended up having to scrape it off. The bread was fresh and hot. With a soft drink (water was gratis), the total was a very reasonable 23 euros. For out second trip, we went with plain chicken schnitzel and grilled chicken, both with fries and break and a very good lemonade. Price was just about 20 euros. Would definitely eat here again.",February 2020,Alexandra Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1152271-Reviews-Alexandra_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
A nice place to try,"Stumbled onto this place as we looked for a place to eat on our first night in Athens. The 'catcher' was personable so while there were not many eating at the time (we eat early by Greek standards) we got a table inside. Overall the food was good though not great. For mains I had the grilled shrimp (five prawns, a bit on the chewy side and as the waiter told me when asked if they were fresh, "" they were frozen fresh, just like fresh"". Thought that was a funny way to put it). Wife had the chicken souvlaki which was very good. With a side of garlic bread, the bill with a small tip was 35 euros.

"When in Athens, Eat Ice Cream","And this is the place to enjoy some really good ice cream. Stopped in twice for their Belgium chocolate ice cream (rich, dark chocolate) and a bubble cone (bubble waffle that was sweet though a bit messy to eat).

If only the Grandeous of the Lobby extended to Rooms,"First impressions upon entering the hotel were wonderful. The Lobby is grand and promises a five star property. Check in was efficient and staff were welcoming. Unfortunately that grandeur didn't extend to the room. Our room (512) was booked as an Executive Special. While it did overlook the pool, the direct view out of the window was of back of a structure which I believe houses the rooftop restaurant. Virtually no view of anything of interest. The room included 1 king size bed, a small refrigerator, a good size bathroom though no heat (or air) and was cold, the hand-held shower was awkwardly placed and you got very familiar with the cord (obviously a retrofit and would have been better if they had just replumbed the shower stall). The bathroom was very clean, no sign of mold. The old phone in the bedroom was dirty. Room lacked plugs and no USB ports. Lighting is poor though typical of most hotel rooms we encountered in Greece. On the plus side, the breakfast was really good though would be nice if it opened before 7am. The views from the breakfast area were great. Location to attractions was very good. Being on the backside of the hotel, it did make for a more quiet stay. Check out was smooth and they held our luggage while we spent additional time exploring the area before departing. Also made sure our taxi driver knew exactly where we were heading.",February 2020,Royal Olympic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d206779-Reviews-Royal_Olympic-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
"The Food is Great, The Staff Greater","This became our go to place when we were on tour in Athens a couple of weeks ago. We 'ran into' Irene on our first night and she was all smiles. We ended up however at another place (our mistake) but the next day as we strolled the area, we saw Irene and immediately knew we had to eat at Elaea at least once. We ended up having three meals there over the next two days and each one was great. Each time we were greeted with smiles and a friendly chat with the host, seated promptly and was attended to by the entire staff as old friends.

THE place to stay in Chania,"As charming as Chania is, La Maison Ottomane is the jewel atop the crown. Alex was the perfect host and the room was comfortable and well appointed. We enjoyed sitting out on the balcony with a nice view of the sea, peeling and enjoying the fantastic oranges (mentioned to Alex how much I liked the oranges and next thing I know we have a bowl full to enjoy). The waterfall shower was fantastic. I'm not a huge breakfast type, but the french toast was wonderful (and have I mentioned the fresh orange juice?) Location wise, it's a easy walk to the sea front in the old town and being less than 2 tenths of a mile from the harbor meant a much quieter night and better sleep.

Better than the reviews.,"Passed by this place a half dozen times during our stay and the ‘catcher’ was always pleasant and not pushy so we stopped in for our last Chania meal and chatted with him as he remembered us from our passings. We eat early so were the only ones on the place. Found it to be very friendly. Started with a complimentary bowl of soup. I don’t eat soup other than chicken noodle but this beef based one was very tasty. I had the spaghetti Napolitan which was good, not great. Wife had mousaki which she enjoyed. A basket of toasted bread and a large orange juice (great) and with the small service fee added the total was 24.8 euros. Place is definitely better than the ratings I later saw on TA. The complimentary dish of what I think was custard was yummy.",February 2020,Gallini,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d1986777-Reviews-Gallini-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Hard to find but worth it,"We stumbled upon this small taverna in the back alley of the old town and at first passed it up. Decided next day to come back and eat and glad we did.

Place is small. 14 seats indoors and a few tables outside. Menu is not as extensive as other places and the name of the game is fresh fish. We both had the grilled dorado which comes with a little green side (looked like rocket salad). They kind of pushed into a small Greek salad to split. Wife is glad they did as it had the best cheese on top. Lots of tomatoes and cucumbers. Plenty for two. Also an order of bread. The fish was great! No tap water offered so bottle water. With a glass of fresh orange juice the total bill was 44.5 euros. Most expensive meal we had in Crete and Greece. While there a guy dropped off a few more fish I presume for the folks coming later. The familiar complementary orange cake and drink were offered.",February 2020,Argo Cafe Tavern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d10783810-Reviews-Argo_Cafe_Tavern-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Better Places. Keep Looking,"Had dinner and at best would say it was below average. Appearance wise it is in dire need of a refreshing. A coat of paint on the inside would do a world of charm. It does not look like the picture on TA (maybe years ago when it first opened). But on to the food.

We started off with some water and a non carbonated soft drink which the waiter knocked over spilling a good third of it on my wife. Accidents happen but did he bother to replace the drink? Nope. The small shrimp fried appetizer was good and plenty for a table. Bread was ok though no dips just a small bottle of olive oil (though there was a large one on the table). French fries were good. For mains we ordered the chicken fillet. Worse we have had while traveling Greece. No flavor at all. It was large though. I ordered shrimp spaghetti in spicy tomato sauce. No spice other than garlic. Had plenty of shrimp but again just bland.

Wait staff were pretty non interested in us (beyond the normal European we won’t interrupt your meal approach which we appreciate). Total for this bland experience was 29 euros.",February 2020,To Maridaki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d6407891-Reviews-To_Maridaki-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Revisited after many years and glad we did,"Although I've lived in the Chattanooga area for over 40 years, it's been at least 15 years since last visited Ruby Falls. Now that our grandkids were old enough to enjoy (and looking for something to do over their Christmas break), we took them for their first tour of the falls and to their Underground Christmas tour. First tip - reserve your tickets on line before you arrive in Chattanooga and go as early in the morning after opening as you can to avoid the big crowds. Added bonus is that if for some reason the falls are closed (the cave flooded on the day of our visited closing the normal route for half a day, though the Christmas experience was open) you'll get an email and options (call their customer service line for better service). I ended up cancelling the normal tour, keeping the Christmas experience. Though when we got to the Falls, used their booking kiosk to rebook tickets for the normal cave tour as they reopened just before noon (saved standing in line to buy tickets, and you can select your timed entry tickets).

From the eyes of our grands, this was a total success. If you're lucky to visit during a rainy day or after, the volume of water from the falls is great. The light show is a bit tacky but the mist is real and smiles all around. The Underground Christmas experience was child friendly fun. A wonderful Santa awaits kids and grownups alike. Plus you get a souvenir geode to take home.

Much improved from the days of yore when I first visited. Yes, there are lines and can be crowded, though as a tourist destination, it's not a 'trap' and doesn't pretend to be anything other than good family fun. Hard core spelunkers have other options in Chattanooga.",December 2019,Ruby Falls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g54946-d104473-Reviews-Ruby_Falls-Chattanooga_Tennessee.html,"Chattanooga, Tennessee",attractions,4.0,4.0
Way better than King Salmon,"After eating at King Salmon, Canyon Steakhouse was a welcomed relief for our second night's dinner. It's located just outside the Princess lodge area easily accessible by free transport. We were famished having been on a full day excursion into the park and were happy to have been seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Our waitress was friendly and engaging. So much different than our previous experience at the Lodge. This is a beef place so we ordered the Porterhouse ($42) and the Beef Tenderloin ($34). Both were cooked as ordered. The sides were very good and the bread was fresh. The Porterhouse was enough for two (a full pound) which I devoured.

Be sure to have a reservation,"Not knowing what to expect at the lodge, we snagged a reservation here for our first night dinner. It is the up-price (not necessary upscale) restaurant on property and gets extremely busy. After being seated, we waited a bit before for our waiter and then longer for some bread. We ordered the Grilled Alaskan Salmon plate and the Asiago Crusted Halibut without the Asiago crust and a side of fries. The grilled salmon was very good and a nice portion. The halibut was on the small side and was ok, not great (expected great being Alaska). Fries were good. Waiter was inattentive for the most part. My glass of water was long gone and I flagged down another wait person for a refill after giving up on him. For dessert ordered the Apple Crisp expecting something great (like the one I had at the Grand Canyon) but alas, it was pretty lame. Again small and not a lot of apple or crisp.

Kantishna Experience,"Definitely the tour to take. Full day (11+ hours on the bus with a few stops to stretch legs, restrooms and snap pictures.). Narrator was excellent and they utilize a neat binocular/camera system that plays on the in-bus monitors for close ups on spotted wildlife. You go to 'the end of the road' on this one and back. We hit it on a cloudless day so Denali was in all of it's glory and splendor. Was late in the season so the big herds were gone, but saw the big 5 and multiples.

Buffet Breakfast was OK,"Stopped in for their buffet breakfast prior to an early start excursion as it was one of the earliest places opened. Overall the buffet was adequate though the selection was a bit limited in my opinion. Had a small selection of cereals (not individually packaged), steel cut oats (were good), scrambled eggs (a bit too runny for me), some breads, yogurt, half way decent bacon, the required reindeer sausage and a few other times. Had a fairly good hot chocolate, orange juice and coffee. Price was $18.99 per person plus tip . Wait staff was friendly enough for the early hour. Place was a bit cold.

Thank Goodness for the Scenery,"We stayed here overnight on a Princess land/cruise vacation with a room in Building 19. The resort is fairly remote so unless you travel to Talkeenta about an hour away ($10 per person round trip) you're resort bound. The main lodge is the hub of activity with an overpriced gift shop but plenty of places to sit around and very nice deck area with views of the majestic Denali. The lodge also has a coffee shop for quick bite breakfast (get there early as they sell out of the best stuff quickly), an upscale dining area (pricey but good, dress in whatever you want) and a less formal dining option that's pretty crowded. There's another stand alone eatery close by with outdoor fire pits (music at night). The lodge rooms are large with a large bathroom. Good shower. Lousy TV reception.

Quirky and Fun Place,"Friends recommended this place for both food and ambiance. Stopped in for a late (almost too late breakfast - served until 3pm). Sitting is communal at large tables. Just find an open seat and the menu is on the table (along with all add ons you'll need with your meal). Tip: push by those lining up at the bakery cases to get to the dining room. For breakfast I ordered the pancake (half, was going for full but waitress cautioned against that - glad she did). Wife ordered breakfast with eggs, bacon (peppered bacon was great), some hash browns and got a whole plate with enough to feed two it looks like. Also got choice of beverage (coffee for her, hot chocolate for me) and a choice of juice. Their signature pancakes overflow a standard size dinner plate (sourdough batter). Great cakes.

Table with a view,"The upscale dining option at the resort and the prices reflect that. We lucked out and got a table next to the windows with a view of Denali at sunset. Can be a little hectic at the front desk with a lot of folks milling around trying to snag reservations (which are a must unless you want to wait and dine much later). We waited about 20 minutes past our reservation time to be seated which was fine as where else are you going to go?

Our order: Chicken Pot Pie ($23) for the wife, Ribeye for me. The Chicken Pot Pie was large and while I thought the sauce was not as good as Stouffer's or Boston Market, wife though it was tasty as well as a good crust. The Ribeye ($41) was a bit on the slim side (thinner cut than one would expect) but was cooked to right temperature (medium rare).
