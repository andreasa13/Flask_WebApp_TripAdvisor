Average hotel,"I believe this should be rated as a 3 star hotel. The staff was nice but there was a day I asked the front desk for my room to be cleaned and it wasn’t done, which was disappointing. We had friends in the next room and they kept running out of hot water but we didn’t have a problem with ours. The restaurant food was expensive (for Cambodian standards) and not very good but the staff was nice and helpful. I recommend eating outside the hotel for lunch and dinner. The gym was very outdated. To access the hotel, you have to go through a sketchy alley.",January 2020,Mane Village Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297390-d12707667-Reviews-Mane_Village_Suites-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",hotels,3.0,5.0
"Nice, quiet atmosphere","We tried walking in yesterday night but it was fully booked so it’s best to make reservations. We sat upstairs and the staff was excellent. The main courses were very good. The menu is 7 courses but there were 8 courses total because there are 2 main courses. We also did the organic herbal pairing; It’s not advertised as tea, but it’s very similar.",January 2020,Embassy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d7260612-Reviews-Embassy-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Fresh tamarind juice!,"We came in for a drink since the restaurant we had reservations for was running behind. The owner was very friendly and personable. This was the first time I’ve had fresh tamarind juice, and it was amazing. I’ve only had canned ones prior. The menu looked great and I wish I had stumbled upon this place sooner. Unfortunately, this is our last night here and we already have dinner plans.",January 2020,Atmosphere Siem Reap,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d10128349-Reviews-Atmosphere_Siem_Reap-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Good spot for authentic food,"Great atmosphere for a quiet meal. You can’t see the views at night but the ambiance makes up for that. The food is authentic and quite tasty. The soft shell crab was good. We had a lemongrass shrimp dip with vegetables that was quite tasty and the hor mok (I think that’s what it’s called) is fantastic. The Chiang mai noodles were okay, they were too creamy for me.",September 2019,Khantok Thai Cuisine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g676354-d11849272-Reviews-Khantok_Thai_Cuisine-Ko_Yao_Yai_Phang_Nga_Province.html,"Ko Yao Yai, Thailand",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A must try while on the Island,This was our second visit to the island and our second time to this restaurant. We found it accidentally the first time and liked it so much we came back during our 2nd trip. It was about a 35 min scooter ride from our hotel (Santhiya) but well worth the trip. The coconut mieng local soup was amazing and made from fresh coconuts. The seafood BBQ was fresh and the crab and squid was better than any that I’ve had back home in the US or in Thailand. The staff is great and also speaks English.,September 2019,Ban Rim Nam Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g676354-d5895969-Reviews-Ban_Rim_Nam_Restaurant-Ko_Yao_Yai_Phang_Nga_Province.html,"Ko Yao Yai, Thailand",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Bad communication,"This hotel would have gotten 4 stars had it not been for the incident today. The front desk receptionist told us that breakfast came with the room. We booked 2 connecting rooms with an ocean view so we can have extra space (for 2 people) and this was our second time staying here. We previously stayed here for a week. Breakfast was included the first stay also. I thought that breakfast closed at 11 on weekends but I was mistaken; it closed at 10:30. We arrived at 10:38 and the hostess told us we were able to get food anyway. Although half of the food was taken away, we grabbed what we could and ate. In the middle of the meal the hostess brings us a check to pay for the meal. She never said it wasn’t included when we gave her the room key when we arrived (during the previous stay we gave them the key and entered when we had breakfast there). Not wanting to argue, we signed the check and asked for a receipt. She never brought it. Once we left breakfast we went back to the hostess stand to ask for a receipt but they told us that we could only get a receipt from the lobby. We proceeded down to the lobby to ask why we had to pay for breakfast if the receptionist told us it was included and the guy in the front looked in the computer and told us it was not included. Had I known it wasn’t included I would’ve went somewhere else for a a breakfast that wasn’t old and cold with half the items missing. The guy in the front wasn’t much help and the lady that told us it was included wasn’t there at the time. They didn’t acknowledge their mistake or apologize once.

The other issue with the hotel is the loud music on Friday and Saturday nights. It’s 1am now and I can’t sleep due to the base from the music from the beach. I do not recommend staying here on weekends.

Other than that, the convenience of the mall next to the hotel is nice. The water pressure is good and the toilets are heated.",September 2019,Grande Centre Point Pattaya,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293919-d15184164-Reviews-Grande_Centre_Point_Pattaya-Pattaya_Chonburi_Province.html,"Pattaya, Thailand",hotels,3.0,4.5
A must try “off strip” restaurant,"This is a hidden gem tucked away in SW Las Vegas and well worth the trip for dinner. Its a nice and non-pretentious mom and pop shop that serves innovative Japanese-French fusion food. I’ve been coming to Japaneiro a few times each month since discovering it 4 years ago. It’s also the best food you can get late at night since it closes at 3am. Chef Kevin is the owner and was at Nobu for a while before opening up his own place and I prefer this spot over Nobu. The restaurant isn’t massive so call first before coming with a large party (8 or more) in case they’re full.
I’ve tried almost everything on the menu and my favorites are the king crab, Nigerian prawn, grilled oysters, baby octopus, chawanmushi with uni (best one in town), and rib eye with truffle bone marrow (I never liked bone marrow until I had this one). The yuzu truffle sauce is addicting that comes with the steaks. Every now and then they have specials shipped in such as a hairy crab but you have to reserve it because they go quickly. You can find out about their specials on their Facebook or Instagram page.",May 2019,Japaneiro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d7779267-Reviews-Japaneiro-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Decent spot for meat dishes,We tried 2 dishes: the ground meat kebabs were delicious but the short ribs were horrible. Don’t order them if you’re used to the ones in the US.,April 2019,Barbadimos Syntagma,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12641648-Reviews-Barbadimos_Syntagma-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good location,We stumbled upon this place because of its excellent location. The mussels were not fresh and very dry. The octopus was tough but had a good flavor and the saganaki was over fried. The chicken soup was the only decent dish. The food gets a 2 but the service and location was great.,April 2019,Ellinikon Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d6674296-Reviews-Ellinikon_Restaurant-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Spacious villa with breathtaking views,"We stayed in the honeymoon villas for 4 nights and had an amazing time. The property boasts a private infinity pool and a hot tub outside, as well as a massive hot tub inside. The place was very clean. Sara was very sweet and the owners were very pleasant. Excellent location! If you rent a car from the guy at the top (very close to the villa’s higher entrance), he lets you park in front of his garage at night since parking there can get crowded. Order the breakfast- it’s delicious.",April 2019,Infinity Collection,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482942-d10154759-Reviews-Infinity_Collection-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Breathtaking views,It’s hard to catch the magnificence of the view in photos so this place is definitely a place to stop in and have some wine and appetizers.,April 2019,Venetsanos Winery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1191887-d8155261-Reviews-Venetsanos_Winery-Megalochori_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Def a must if you’re in Athens,The hike to get up isn’t strenuous at all but it’s pretty slippery in some parts of the rocks if you venture around so wear comfortable shoes and not high heels.

Good ambiance,We came here because it was very close to our hotel. The staff was excellent and the restaurant was nice and updated. The food presentation was excellent but the flavors were just okay. The garlic purée paste was interesting and pretty good. The octopus tasted old. The complimentary dessert was good.,April 2019,Athinaikon Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1045564-Reviews-Athinaikon_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
One of the top spots in Santorini - call ahead,This place was so good we had it for lunch and went back for dinner. It’s a mom and pop shop and the wife runs the front of house so smoothly. She is very sweet and even helped me get the bones out of my fish. The grilled shrimp was amazing.,April 2019,Salt & Pepper,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d2056888-Reviews-Salt_Pepper-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
It’s okay,The service was amazing but food was mediocre. The short ribs were quite tasty but that was the only memorable dish. I don’t eat raw food so they offered substitutes. My seafood dishes were substituted with vegetarian dishes unfortunately. I thought they would give me something comparable but it was only 2 courses out of 14.,April 2019,Hytra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3709153-Reviews-Hytra-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
A must try!,I’d give this place more stars if I could. Our hotel recommended this place and every dish was wonderful. The red fish pasta was one of the best pasta dishes I’ve ever had. It tastes much better than it looks. Both deserts were amazing also. We will be back to try more dishes.,April 2019,BlueFish Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d13568534-Reviews-BlueFish_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Cute lunch spot,I ordered the mixed seafood platter. It came with a nice variety of different seafood. It was mostly fried. I was expecting grilled but I should’ve asked beforehand. The service is excellent and the spot is good for people watching.,April 2019,Diodos Archaias Agoras,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1076890-Reviews-Diodos_Archaias_Agoras-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
