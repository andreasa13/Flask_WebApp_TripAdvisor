Best Trekking Company Ever!,"From start to finish, this trekking company's organizer, Upendra, was the most professional, most helpful, most accommodating, and most personally engaging and friendly trip manager that you could have. Every single detail from domestic flight arrangements to airport drop off to trekking route requests was handled smoothly and without any stress or miscommunication. Our guide, Raju, was perfect. He was professional and knowledgeable but his engaging and friendly manner turned him into a close friend immediately.
During the trek, our party of 5 had to split up to accommodate one of the hiking member's bout with altitude sickness and seemlessly Raju and Upendra worked to enable our group to split up to allow for one group to proceed with the hike while another member rested and met up with us a day later. Every need was taken into consideration. We could not have been more pleased with this trekking company, and with Upendra and Raju in particular.

Great location and very clean,"The room was simple but clean and had all necessities. The location was superb to explore the gem that is Hellnar. Lovely beach access and hiking areas. Food was fine, a bit pricey. The only issue I had with the hotel was the reception staff being cold and abrupt. Rather giving off a condescending feel. All other staff were wonderful but I must admit that the desk staff rather tainted my feel of the hotel.",October 2016,Fosshotel Hellnar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g671732-d655052-Reviews-Fosshotel_Hellnar-Hellnar_West_Region.html,"Hellnar, Iceland",hotels,4.0,4.0
"Very handy, clean, efficient!","I cannot say enough about the location of this hotel! Steps from the train station and convenient to the main attractions in Oslo. I only stayed one night but was so pleased with my choice. Great bathroom, simple room, all I needed. Would probably be a little small for a multi-day stay, but for my one night stay it was perfect.
