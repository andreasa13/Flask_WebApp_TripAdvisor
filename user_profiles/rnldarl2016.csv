Nice hotel/great location,Stayed one night only on a Heathrow layover. Hotel room was quiet and fairly large and featured a view of the castle. Very convenient to many restaurants and shops.

Surprisingly good,"Had passed this restaurant many times in recent years, but never entered. There was usually a guy waiving menus out front which is rarely a sign of quality.

Great day trip from Athens,Was looking for a day trip from Athens that wasn’t too far afield. We decided on Ancient Corinth and it proved to be a good choice.

Memorable meal,"Can’t praise L’Arcimboldo enough. Small place, maybe holds 30. Reservations are a good idea; people were turned away when we ate Sunday lunch there. Staff are friendly, courteous, and attentive. But it’s all about the food. The tortellini and tortellini were excellent.",April 2019,L'Arcimboldo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187801-d8024157-Reviews-L_Arcimboldo-Bologna_Province_of_Bologna_Emilia_Romagna.html,"Bologna, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A hidden gem,Went to the Grunin Center for the first time in September 2018 to see a musical. It’s a small venue so every seat affords a good view. Acoustics are good. Parking is free. We returned a couple of months later for a concert. Definitely a place to put on your radar if you enjoy live performances.,November 2018,Jay and Linda Grunin Center for the Arts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g46870-d14090267-Reviews-Jay_and_Linda_Grunin_Center_for_the_Arts-Toms_River_New_Jersey.html,"Toms River, New Jersey",attractions,5.0,5.0
Top notch,"My wife and I had dinner at Juanito’s, and really enjoyed everything about the experience. Staff was friendly and attentive. Chips were good, not at all greasy or overly salted. We had the enchiladas Del Mar and it was excellent. Many families dining on a Friday night.

"Great location, average food","Based on the recommendation of a neighbor, my wife and I reserved a table at the Shrimp Box during a recent weekend trip. Very nice location with water views. The service was very attentive and friendly, The food was average. Nice salad bar and excellent scallop appetizer. The rest of the food we had, fried calamari, crab cakes, flounder filet, was so-so. The broiled shrimp was dry and relatively tasteless. If you want seafood in Point Pleasant, I’d look elsewhere.",September 2018,The Shrimp Box & Outside The Box Patio Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g46745-d1546982-Reviews-The_Shrimp_Box_Outside_The_Box_Patio_Bar-Point_Pleasant_Beach_New_Jersey.html,"Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Great Thai Food,"We were cruising around looking for a place to have dinner and happened upon the Jasmine ToGo. Despite the name, you can dine in. The mixed appetizer platter was very good, especially the spring rolls and steamed dumplings. The service was attentive and friendly. Prices were moderate.
