"An extraordinary meal, filled with creativity and a bit of humor","We finally made it to Ileana Regan's fine restaurant. Chef was there to help explain the theme: Harry Potter. The place is small, you prepay well in advance, and is filled with nice staff willing to answer my questions (I've worked in restaurants and play in the kitchen a lot at home). The theme hit many of the characters' favorite dishes (Dumbledore, Hagrid, etc.), with titles like Herbology, Fleur, Stoat Sandwich, Butter Beer. The portions are thankfully small - with 11 or 12 courses, that helps with what can be an overfilling experience. Our favorites were the mandrake - a radish in edible soil with cultured butter on the bottom; the pasties, one of peas, one of pastrami, and lamb in a tiny cast iron skillet; a spiny lobster disk with saffron; a porridge with chicken stock (Chef told me how they get such a deep flavor - they reduce it); and we ended with her take on butter beer - an oat ginger cake with butterscotch and white chocolate.

A new favorite or ours,"We were searching for a place to entertain a relative near one of our children's home in Barrington. We found this restaurant, relatively new in the area (they have about 9 or 10 restaurants of this type around the country) and we were quite pleased. Their fish and chips were delightful - without the extra grease that so often comes with this dish (avoidable by keeping the frying oil at a constant temperature). The coastal salad, with shrimp and crab, was quite good. Another time, my wife had crabcakes which were also delicious. She likes it so much that she's going again in a day or so.",January 2020,The Hampton Social,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g36716-d18189340-Reviews-The_Hampton_Social-South_Barrington_Illinois.html,"South Barrington, Illinois",restaurants,5.0,3.5
"Staying at the Costabaja Hotel, this was a convenient and good choice for a meal","After fellow-travelers recommended this restaurant, we had a very good meal there. I had the fish in garlic sauce which was crisp on the outside, tender and flaky on the inside - quite tasty. My wife had the tortilla soup which was quite a large meal in itself. We shared the clam chowder which was quite good. We also shared flan vainilla de rompope (a custard dessert with an eggnog-type alcoholic beverage in the sauce), which was very delicious.",January 2020,Steinbeck's Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g150771-d2073679-Reviews-Steinbeck_s_Restaurant-La_Paz_Baja_California.html,"La Paz, Mexico",restaurants,4.0,4.0

We took a private snorkeling and kayak tour and loved it,"Pepe, our guide, was flexible and very helpful, not only in helping us get our gear on, but suggesting it was too rough to go out in kayaks to the Cabo arch and taking us to a more protected inlet (I think the name was Santa Maria). Before, he got us close to the arch so we could take pictures. The water was cold (between 65 and 70 degrees F), but we were prepared. I had my own wetsuit and High Tide provided one for my wife.

An elegant place to have a lovely meal,"This restaurant is mainly for tourists - principally because of the cost - but it does deliver on fine cuisine. I had the short ribs, which were wonderfully flavorful. I ended up sharing much of my dish with my wife who chose stuffed poblanos (called chiles relleno on the bill). We warned her that it might be a bit spicy for her and, unfortunately, it turned out to be so. That's not the restaurant's fault, of course.

"Highly recommended by Valeria at our hotel, Casa Natalia, we were very pleased","Just a block or two from our hotel on the main plaza, we were treated to an excellent meal. We started with six oysters, delightfully fresh and tasty. The bonita - the fish of the day - was tender and deliciously sauced.

Impressive and a must-see - it should be on everyone's bucket list!,"It is hard to describe the impressive experience that is Petra - the Siq (a winding sandstone passageway with incredible beauty), the Treasury (actually a tomb that just appears at the end of the Siq), the other tombs on the way that demonstrate the extraordinary carving skills of the Nabatean culture. Some tourist stuff to buy, including frankincense and myrrh (my wife took this back to a cleric she knows well - who loved it) and many scarves.

The location is outstanding; the hotel could use an update,"You can't get closer to Petra than this hotel and still have a relatively comfortable night.

A sprawling and beautiful hotel on the Dead Sea,"It is hard to describe adequately the beauty of the grounds, the pools, the rooms, but it is only one of many hotels built fairly recently catering to the luxury tourist trade. The rates are high, even though the hotel did not seem full. The food was good, though at one meal the flies were so persistent, we moved to an inside elevator lobby to eat our food - the servers were apologetic and helpful even given the problem.

An elegant hotel with views of the Nile and Tahrir Square,"The rooms at this hotel are very large and well-appointed. They billed our room as having a 'pyramid view,' but that is misleading - if you have powerful binoculars and clear weather, you might see the pyramids way off in the distance.

A dazzling display of history and culture,"Prior to going to the Acropolis, we spent time with a guide sampling Greek sculpture and culture in this relatively new and beautifully displayed museum. Many of the sculptures (in particular, the man with the sacrificial animal on his shoulder, which appears in many basic art books). The exhibit of the Pathenon marbles, most of which are in the British Museum (the Elgin Marbles), was well done, but you could tell the Greeks' ache and anger that such a marvel is not where it belongs.

A wonderful tour of downtown Athens' food offerings,"Our guide, Carolina, was delightful (she runs the operation in Athens). We have been on two other Culinary Backstreet tours - Istanbul and Barcelona. This was was the equal of our excellent past experiences. The food ranged from coffee prepared so carefully, to beef pounded thin with olive oil, to sweets of all sorts, to olives, a honey tasting (what a variety!), and commentary that helped us understand how this food came to be so good.

A wonderful meal and great conversations with the chefs,"This restaurant was recommended by our guide, Carolina, from Culinary Backstreets (they conduct food tours in many countries).

A wonderful and creative pre-theatre meal,"Prior to going to the Cadillac Palace Theatre, we ate at this restaurant part of Block 37. Our friends had eaten there for brunch and lunch before, but not for dinner. They (and we) were quite pleased. I had the seared yellowfin tuna which was as rare as I like it with a nice sauce and sunchoke chips. My wife had the Rohan duck breast which was excellent - the salad of brussels sprouts, confit of duck and figs, and candied walnuts was devoured completely. One of our friends had the Scottish salmon with a sweet Thai chili sauce and loved it. His wife had a smaller appetite and had the meze plate, with stuffed grape leaves (a bit dry), hummus, eggplant dip (baba ganoush), etc. We shared two desserts - the chocolate cherry bombe was the favorite (dark chocolate and cherry mousse), though I liked the apple cider donuts (they were kind enough to substitute vanilla bean ice cream for the whiskey flavored ice cream.

A fine Italian meal,"Prior to a performance at Steppenwolf, we returned to this restaurant not only because of its convenience to the theatre, but because of the excellent food and service. This time we shared a special tagliatelle dish which was quite tasty - veal meatballs in a light tomato sauce and house-made pasta. In addition, we shared another special, a roulade of beef (spidine) with fontina cheese and nicely sauteed spinach. We finished with a pistachio semifreddo (a light ice cream-like dish) which, while very good, was not as rich as the one I make (said my wife).

A reliable chain with carefully prepared and presented food,"We have eaten at other members of this restaurant group (Las Vegas most recently) and find it reliable and with very good choices. My wife and I shared the French onion soup (yes, she let me have some), which, as usual had a depth of flavor, loads of caramelized onions, and a large amount of delicious gruyere cheese on top. She had a salad (which she did not share) and I had escargot (snails, in case there's a failure of your French :-)). Both were quite good - the escargot were tender and in a not-too-buttery/garlicky sauce. Our friends had the steak frites and they were quite pleased. For dessert, the creme brulee, the chocolate mousse were very tasty. Because it was one of our friend's birthday, our server, Chrissy, brought a gougere with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce - with a candle.

A great and unusual museum in a lovely building,"We were in town for a baseball game, but heard very good things about this museum on the campus of the Milwaukee School of Engineering. It is designed to show paintings (some photos, too) of people at work, from glassblowing to blacksmithing to medicine, etc. The arrangement of the artworks, some better executed than others, but all on the theme, is impressive. There are works from the 16th century (even a Bruegel) to the 20th (a wonderful Normal Rockwell - the Bookworm, on the cover of Saturday Evening Post in 1926). We had the museum to ourselves - it was a Friday afternoon - and had the company of Ann, one of the staff members in charge of many member and guest functions at the museum, who showed us around several places not ordinarily visited. Dr. Grohmann was there in his impressive office and was kind enough to let us come in and see the gorgeous stained glass windows (the images are of artwork in the museum). Dr. Grohman, Ann told us, owned a forge company in Milwaukee and made a gift of his collection to the MSOE - which has been added to since the museum opened in 2007.

A very good choice for a pre-opera meal,"After several substandard meals in the Lyric building and around, we decided to try One North and were quite pleased. A friend and I ate here for lunch in April and the grilled cheese and spinach salad were excellent (though I was a little surprised when there were extra charges for bacon, $3, substituting for a side salad, also $3, and, most odd, adding a tomato slice to the sandwich cost $1!). Putting this aside, because of the quality of the meals, my wife and I came back before one of our operas in May. We had the filet sliders, which were quite tender and tasty, an order of grilled asparagus, also delicious, fish and chips (a bit greasy, but that seems quite common - still delightful), and ended sharing the good bread pudding.

The chopped salad was full of great ingredients and tasted very good. The only exception: I had what they call the Northwest Havana, a take on the Cuban sandwich - unfortunately, the pulled pork had a significant amount of fat. I did not eat any more of it.

The food, though expensive (most has to be imported from some distance), was quite good in the main restaurant. The saltwater lagoon with many, many beautiful fish was a great place to try out my iPhone XR (with a waterproof case) for terrific pictures. It was easy getting into town and the concierge guided us to the food trucks on the ocean - a very good meal and fun to be there with lots of children playing. The room was large enough, the bed comfortable, and our view was pleasant enough (garden view).

Highly rated and it didn't disappoint,"On my son's recommendation, we ate here before we drove up to Seattle to see his family. What a treat! We started with the langostinos amelcochados - we were told it was a relatively recent addition to the menu. It was superb - the shrimp were coated in a mildly sweet, but crunchy coating which was wonderful. It was served on pureed cauliflower - my wife liked it, but I found it a bit bland. We then had stuffed piquillo peppers rellenos, which was small, but delicious - just enough spice. We shared the Peruvian equivalent of paella, Arroz con Mariscos, which was excellent - since my wife is allergic to mussels, it came with more of the other seafood: shrimp, octopus, whitefish, scallops, and calamari. We ended the meal with the Peruvian flan, Leche Asada, which was thicker than the Mexican flan I make, but delightful nonetheless. Though I've been to Peru, I had not had the widely-used lucuma fruit, but the Sublime con Lucuma, a chocolate bar with mousse and a lucuma panna cotta - it was, as the name suggests, sublime. The surprise came with the bill - it was not as expensive as the quality of the food warranted.",April 2019,Andina Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g52024-d440005-Reviews-Andina_Restaurant-Portland_Oregon.html,"Portland, Oregon",restaurants,5.0,4.5
My friend and I have been here many times; the first time there was a stumble,"I have eaten here a number of times and have been generally pleased with many of the offerings: hamburger, grilled cheese (unique in that there is a nice crisp coating of cheese on the outside as well), and other dishes. This visit one of the specials, a crab cake appetizer, was announces as using lump crabmeat. Since I make crabcakes and use little binder or vegetables, I asked if there was any red or green peppers in the cakes. The server said,""Absolutely not."" The crab cakes came and not only were they a bit mealy without identifiable lumps of crabmeat, but they were filled with both kinds of peppers. I ate them, but I told the server (Kyle) that he should know what was in them. He did offer to take them back and give me something else, which was good, but I did not take him up on the offer. I also had the poblano soup which was good. My friend liked his chicken wrap, also a special, which came with a boatload of good french fries.",March 2019,Fred's Garage Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g36897-d13277167-Reviews-Fred_s_Garage_Restaurant-Winnetka_Illinois.html,"Winnetka, Illinois",restaurants,3.0,4.0
A friend's favorite bistro did not disappoint!,"A friend and her husband have been going here for years and she finally got us to meet her for lunch. [Do use their valet parking at $16 - or maybe use a parking app: there is absolutely no parking in the area.] I started out with escargot, which was delightful - 6 plump pieces in an excellent, but not overly assertive sauce. Our friend had the lobster salad which not only looked great, but was very tasty - lots of large pieces of lobster, including the sweet claw meat. My wife had the foie gras which was good, but did not stand out like many foie gras dishes we have had elsewhere. I also had onion soup, while very good, lacked a bit of flavor in the broth. Though we were there a bit after 12:30 and the restaurant was not overly filled, it took quite a while to get our meals - I'm not sure of the reason. All in all, though, once the food came, it was a very satisfying meal.",March 2019,La Sardine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d429327-Reviews-La_Sardine-Chicago_Illinois.html,"Chicago, Illinois",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"A rating of the best burger in town got us there, but, oh, what else we found!","We saw the review in the Chicago Tribune that said this restaurant had the best burger in the Chicago area (of 71 the reviewer ate!). We had a play to see downtown and decided to stop at this restaurant on the way. Not only was the burger outstanding, with raclette cheese (a favorite of ours), shiitake mushrooms, roasted onions all on a house-made pretzel bun, but we found much more on the menu that will guarantee a return visit. We started with their own made rye baguette ($3 extra), also delicious, with a foie gras treat - quite good. We added a half order of their take on potato pancakes: they were little squares of thin pancake with a mild horseradish sauce and were excellent. We ended the meal sharing their butter cake with a watermelon sauce (coulis), a sorbet, and an almond tuile, presented very creatively and very tasty. The menu is short, but creative and, though the space was a bit chilly at times, we were warmed by the wonderful food. And Chris, our server, was very helpful and pleasant.",February 2019,"Table, Donkey and Stick",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d873387-Reviews-Table_Donkey_and_Stick-Chicago_Illinois.html,"Chicago, Illinois",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A family lunch that went well,"Although the place was not filled, service was very, very slow even though we were there somewhat after the main lunch rush. With two grandchildren who are very picky eaters, we did not find something for them to eat other than french fries - the fried chicken tenders were not to their liking, but I tried them and they were quite good. The 3 items for $10 was a very good deal, with salad, a main, and a drink - plus in one case a side of boursin mac and cheese. The pulled BBQ chicken sandwich was tasty and even provided a dinner for my wife that night. She had the steak salad, which was well prepared with a lot of steak. The Ultimate Nacho Chicken was an enormous plate of chips, cheese, salsa, and chicken - which is impossible (IMHO) for one to eat - four of us did make a significant dent in it, though.",February 2019,Hudson Grille,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60898-d938928-Reviews-Hudson_Grille-Atlanta_Georgia.html,"Atlanta, Georgia",restaurants,4.0,3.5
A family meal that was quite good,"We set up a family lunch - four vegetarians and two not - and had a lovely meal. It was a Sunday and very busy (we were told it is busy most days), but we got seated in about 15 minutes. The food was very good and in enormous quantities. The avocado toast was excellent; the pancakes, of many varieties (from plain to chocolate chip/banana) were light, fluffy, and delicious; the hash browns were crisp and very tasty; the six pieces of cinnamon roll french toast fed one plus two very hungry grandchildren! The breakfast burrito - vegetarian, of course - was eaten happily. All in all, a great experience and one we'd repeat.",February 2019,Stray Hen Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35953-d14795824-Reviews-Stray_Hen_Cafe-Elmhurst_DuPage_County_Illinois.html,"Elmhurst, Illinois",restaurants,5.0,4.0
A visit with friends led us to this place; what a pleasant surprise,"The Glen Club caters mainly to the golfers who use the connected course, but it is open to the public. It is a very country-club-like restaurant with a bar and comfortable seating. My friend and I shared the special - a bbq brisket sandwich with gouda and shoestring fried onions, with a side of sweet potato fries. It was quite good; the meat was lean (not always a given with brisket) and the bbq sauce was sweet and tangy. My wife had a huge salad which was also good; there was so much, she had to divide it up and take some home. My friend's wife had a huge, delicious tuna salad sandwich. A very pleasant surprise.",February 2019,The Glen Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g36052-d246861-Reviews-The_Glen_Club-Glenview_Illinois.html,"Glenview, Illinois",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Not bad, but there are many better burger, etc., places around","After an early movie at Northbrook Court, we decided to try this place after we had not been there for many years. Though the burger I had (a smashed Motherlode) was decently done, it did not have the crisp edges that the special menu promised. It was loaded with bacon which masked the plainness of the burger itself. My wife had a small salad from the salad bar which was good and a cup of turkey chili, which was also good and, thankfully (to us), not very spicy. The restaurant itself is badly in need of a refreshment; the plastic plate my burger came on just seemed cheap. Our server, Jason, was pleasant and we got our food quickly.",January 2019,The Claim Company of Norhtbrook,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g36464-d1969034-Reviews-The_Claim_Company_of_Norhtbrook-Northbrook_Illinois.html,"Northbrook, Illinois",restaurants,3.0,4.0
"A lovely, well-designed concept - more consistent food might come in time","We met friends here for dinner. The restaurant has been open less than a year. The decorations are impressive as is the service - our server, Anthony, was bright, funny, and helpful. We started with a finnan haddie dip, which was just OK - it needed some brightness (perhaps a bit more lemon?). I had the fish and chips: the haddock was excellent, but the chips (Brit for french fries) were soft and not crisp (as the menu promised). My wife had a dish called suet pie, though it was more like a stew: it did not have a great flavor, but it, too, was OK. Our friends had the rabbit (quite good; the sauce was very tasty) and the shepherd's pie (which our friends liked, but we found a bit plain). We ended with a dessert called millionaire's shortbread - it was heavy on the chocolate ganache - not necessarily a bad thing, but very short on the shortbread. Since the Scots are wonderful shortbread makers, that dessert could have been better with a thicker shortbread base and a bit less chocolate (though I do qualify as a chocoholic...).",January 2019,Balmoral Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2398635-d14792073-Reviews-Balmoral_Restaurant-Campton_Hills_Illinois.html,"Campton Hills, Illinois",restaurants,3.0,5.0
A celebratory meal that was quite delicious,"After some good news, we decided to celebrate at this sushi restaurant near us. [They were moving to a larger space in the same mall within a few days of our visit.] We started with crispy spicy tuna with black rice, which was very tasty. We added the rainbow dragon roll - the biggest sushi roll I've ever seen, making it a challenge to get each piece in our mouths at once - not successful, but worth the effort. The flavors were from different fish on top - creating a rainbow effect. Service was quick and pleasant.",December 2018,BluFish Sushi Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g36052-d3984333-Reviews-BluFish_Sushi_Bistro-Glenview_Illinois.html,"Glenview, Illinois",restaurants,4.0,4.5
A fascinating and creative menu for New Year's Eve,"One seating (at 6PM) on New Year's Eve at this very small (24 diners) Japanese-inspired restaurant, run by Chef Ileana Regan (of Elizabeth), turned out to be quite a delight. It was an 8-course tasting menu with surprises and pleasures in each course. An opening (not a course, but apparently a standard) was the fig miso sourdough bread with white truffle honey butter - knowing we had a lot of food coming, we tried, unsuccessfully, not to eat it all, but it was so good. Scallops carpaccio were fresh and briny with a citrus scent. The presentation of the Chawnamushi, in a persimmon shell was creative, but the flavor was not up to the presentation - it was good, but not at the level of the other courses. The sort-of 'gnocchi' was fun to figure out just what was on the plate, though the black truffle and oyster mushroom starred. The small piece of foie gras was carefully prepared and quite delicious. Next was lobster, cooked perfectly, with a buckwheat risotto and yuzu (a citrus). The aged slices of beef (washugyu - American wagyu beef) were heavenly - not as marbled as some wagyu we've had before, but still prepared quite well. Crisp brown butter oats accompanied the citrus sorbet - a palate cleanser, which was quite good. Two desserts followed; a budino with a Japanese flavor (pudding with banana and other flavors) and a decadent chocolate treat to end the 8 courses. Some interesting gummies and a cookie actually ended the meal, but we were too full to eat them there; we took them home and ate them the next day - worth the wait. Though the meal was pricey ($200 per person, paid in advance through Tock, the system the Alinea set up some time ago - which includes a tip), it was well worth the cost in our opinion.",December 2018,Kitsune Restaurant and Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35805-d12234023-Reviews-Kitsune_Restaurant_and_Pub-Chicago_Illinois.html,"Chicago, Illinois",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Great pre-opera fare,"We have eaten here many times. The food occasionally misses the mark, but this trip, we had a great meal and Kelley, our server, could not have been nicer. The corn soup was velvety and delicious; the gumbo was a bit spicy, but still good. My wife had the crabcake appetizer as a main course and it was quite tasty. I opted for something a bit simpler, the tortellini rosa: I was surprised and pleased at how good the pasta and the sauce were. Our dinner companion had the lamb shank, which was huge, but very tasty. He ate every little bit.

We were not disappointed. It arrived a deep golden brown and carved at our table. The skin was fat-free and delightfully crisp. The servers expertly put the fixings in wrappers and in buns. Three of the four of us (one was not a duck fan) loved the flavors and presentation. One of our group had moo shu pork which was also quite good. The last of our foursome had the lemon chicken which, unfortunately, was bland and not very tasty, though it was crisp. We started with hot and sour soup (nicely done with lovely bits of seafood), potstickers, and shrimp toast - very good. We were so full, we could not even think about dessert?

The food is generally not great, but our most recent visit makes it unlikely we will eat here again. My wife and I both ordered the beef stroganoff special. We were the earliest seated, but the entree was inexplicably cold when it got to us and my wife had three small pieces of beef and I had two. The flavor was not of stroganoff and we weren’t sure what recipe they used (I make it often at home - this offering was not good). The salads were OK and the two cookies that came with each meal were good, though a bit oversweet. Our friend had a sandwich, which was acceptable.
