"Wonderful, tasty, food",This Indian restaurant has wonderful food. I love their buffet lunch as they serve a variety of dishes and the naan is so soft and light. Everything is very tasty and they have become our favorite and our go to Indian restaurant.,October 2019,Bay Leaves Indian Cuisine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34678-d12855423-Reviews-Bay_Leaves_Indian_Cuisine-Tampa_Florida.html,"Tampa, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful and tranquil,"The climb to the top of this mountain was certainly worth it. One can see why this spot was chosen for the Gods, the view is stunning. Seeing the ruins, you can get a sense of life in ancient Greece. The town of Delphi is small but very quaint with a fair amount of restaurants.",October 2019,Delphi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d523823-Reviews-Delphi-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Breathtaking,The only word that can describe the view from on top the mountain side is breathtaking. The climb was a pull for me but I stopped at every platform to catch my breath and made it to the top. There is a stadium at the top that was used before the Olympic games was founded in Olympia. You get a sense of the amount of people in ancient times that walked where I was walking. The climb to the top is very much worth the effort.,October 2019,Mount Parnassus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d199056-Reviews-Mount_Parnassus-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
This museum didn't disappoint,The museum was very well laid out and described as were all the Greek museums that we attended. This one didn't disappoint. It is so amazing that the Greek ministry was able to accumulate all these artifacts with so well thought out descriptions.,October 2019,Delphi Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d199057-Reviews-Delphi_Archaeological_Museum-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Great location,"We only stayed here one night to see the ruins and museum. This hotel is right on the main street and was only about 10 minutes from the site so an excellent location. There was a good selection of eating places around, the shopping was limited but we had done our shopping in Athens so that was okay. It is a small hotel but was comfy enough for our stay.",October 2019,Parnassos Delphi Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189408-d250609-Reviews-Parnassos_Delphi_Hotel-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",hotels,5.0,3.5
Worth the visit,You can just imagine ancient Greeks walking around in this marketplace. The temple which was in the ancient times filled with shops and shoppers was very impressive. The museum also had some great artifacts. It is worth the visit and not as hectic as the nearby acropolis. We enjoyed it.,October 2019,Ancient Agora of Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198709-Reviews-Ancient_Agora_of_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Excellant museum, worth the effect","This museum is worth every penny of the entrance fee. It is well lighted, chronologically laid out with plaques that explained what you were looking at. Lots of statues and armor and pottery of different eras. We also had downloaded a self guided audio tour from Rick Steves which gave context to some of the statues with some background stories. There was so much to look and all so interesting at this museum that you would need several hours. You will not be bored.",October 2019,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A bargain hunter;s dream,"So many shops to see with prices that vary so if you have the time check several places before buying. We enjoyed our time here hunting for bargains, there were several guys from Africa that approached us saying nice things while putting a matching weaved bracelets on our wrists saying it was free and after saying how good they looked, they asked for money to help their family. So effectively you paid for the bracelets. A bit deceptive, I think.",October 2019,Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d265865-Reviews-Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great people watching place,We enjoyed walking around the Plaka. Lots of different and unique shops and so many dining options. The restaurants with their sidewalk dining areas was perfect to eat and rest and just take in the sites and watch the people pass by.

Great tour,"Our guide George who is an archeologist as well was very informative and enthusiastic about Greek culture. We learnt a lot about the history and even the democratic system that was used back then. He took us to this hill where you can get a good picture of Athens and while walking, he is finding broken pottery on the ground, that he is showing us is from the ancient times. We enjoyed this very much. Highly recommend.",October 2019,Athens Free Walking Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d3629217-Reviews-Athens_Free_Walking_Tour-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great temple,So impressive even if a lot of it is in ruins.

Impressive,This was a bit of a climb but it was doable. You could see the whole of Athens from the top.

Excellant location,We enjoyed our stay here. The breakfast buffet was good and filling. The hotel is very central and is in walking distance to transport to and from the airport.

Good hotel,"We drove from Athens and had to call for directions as we got a little lost. The front desk was very helpful and directed us straight to their door.

Great experience,"What can be said about Hans. He was a friendly, funny tour guide that looked after us completely and made us feel very relaxed. He showed us how to drive these electric cars and it turned out to be so much fun. Everywhere we stopped, people were asking us how do they get on this tour? He drove in front of us and we just followed him so none of us got lost or anything. He was very knowledgeable about the island and even made a stop at a supermarket as a few of us wanted to buy some things. Great job Hans, we had a wonderful time with you as our guide. I highly recommend this tour.",October 2017,Roadrunner Bonaire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147268-d6385113-Reviews-Roadrunner_Bonaire-Kralendijk_Bonaire.html,Bonaire,attractions,5.0,5.0
