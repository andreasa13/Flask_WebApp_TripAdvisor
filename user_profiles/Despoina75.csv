Turns the fantasy of how we think we would enjoy our wine in Paris true.,"In French Agapes is called an intimate meal with friends and family. I find this particularly lovely as Agapes is a Greek word which is the plural of Agape (Αγάπη - - > love). The early Christian communities living in the beautiful caves of Cappadocia would have at the end of the day meals during which they would pray together and share their labours, experiences, and feelings. Those were named Agapes (as Greek was the language then). What a lovely word for the French to use. However, the Google translation for this is apparently ""Love Feasts"", love feasts... In any case, Les Agapes de Nina is where I've been January 18th and now during Covid days I greatly miss.

I remember so fondly the small yet selective taste wines list. You could have them with a selection of cheese or a meats selection. The wines were all divine and carefully catered. The place is small and cozy. The prices are true value for money. This place provided the perfect place to enjoy your wine and take in the Paris ambience.",January 2020,SDN2 SAS Les Agapes de Nina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d8135398-Reviews-SDN2_SAS_Les_Agapes_de_Nina-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Acropolis is the Greek heart,"No one loves the Parthenon and the Acropolis more than the Athenian people do. It is the centre of our heart and even though many Athenians never have even visited it is what we see when we look up. We see something beautiful, something eternal, something that speaks through every century to us. So many days and nights and beautiful strolls around the Acropolis. Smelling the hot air, watching performances in Herodotus Theatre and having the Acropolis as a crown, looking up in hope. Hope for eternity and beauty. Do visit but also experience as an Athenian would; stroll down the many sokakia, eat a fish or meat ""pikilia"" (tapas plate) at Dioskouri, stroll in all laziness around Dionysiou Areopagitou, go to Psyri for a coffee that lasts for hours.

Iconic Portobello destination that meets expectations,"Electric cinema, dinner, and the members club are all an iconic Portobello destination that does actually congregate the locals and is not a tourist trap. The Dinner manages to retain customer loyalty for so many years by consistently delivering in quality of food, service, and atmosphere.

Unbelievably good food,I was actually shocked with this place. It offered a healthy all you can eat buffet all for just £7.5 with good vegetarian options. Both the quality of the food and taste is incredible and what I would expect to eat at some niche hipster place that would charge me an arm and a leg. It even looks like a hipster place in East London.

Check temporary exhibitions as you might not want to miss it,"If you love modern and contemporary art, this is a great museum. It has a very good permanent exhibition and as part of your ticket audio tour is also covered. When I visited I was very lucky in that Studio Drift had a temporary exhibition. It was breathtaking and one of the best things I've ever seen. Also, between this museum and Rijksmuseum you will see a good selection of Ferdi's work.

It really is worth checking what are the running exhibitions (and I would add MOCO museum round the corner to that) as it might prove to really be a treat :)

ps. Also, the restaurant does a killer mustard soup!",August 2018,Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190676-Reviews-Stedelijk_Museum_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.0
"Lovely, lovely hotel (and general tips)","I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and I would recommend as a choice for anyone wanting to visit Fuerteventura. I would particularly like to thank for the kindness and helpfulness the receptionists (Omar and Gaetano), the public relations rep (Annabel), and the porter David. Without them I do not think my stay would be as awesome as it was and actually might have proved quite difficult.

The hotel is beautiful and very feel good. The food was amazing. I had half board and I do recommend it. The spa was also very good. For me this was one of my favourite holidays to date.

General tips and things I would have liked to know before my visit or during:

- If the weather is bad use the spa, it's a great spa and the staff is amazing. Also, go to the spa if you like spas. It is genuinely very good.
- All the rooms are gigantic and very good. All the ones with sea view appeared good to me. I thought perhaps the southern garden rooms might have better views (even views of the sea), but I might be wrong there.
- I especially liked the bathroom arrangement. I had a premium double room and there was a large walk in shower and a bath in the room.
- Try to book the room you want before going (e.g. floor or area of the hotel), if you have your heart set on something. It is worth contacting them even if you have booked through agency or website. Once you are there they might be fully booked so perhaps not much opportunity for an upgrade or change of rooms.
- The hotel is very good and generous with towels, etc.
- Guests completely disregard and disobey pool rules of not reserving with their towels loungers and sun umbrellas. I did not have any problems myself with this as I did found places to sit (I was also only one person). But I did see that other people who could not find somewhere, they asked for help from the public relations rep and that resolved things.
- In general, if you have problems usually reception is very good at helping out. I would recommend speaking to them in person, though, rather than over the phone.
- The beach front does not belong to the hotel so there are extra charges. Also, personally I liked much better the beach further up on the north in front of Barcelo'.
- Atlantic supermarket is very close by (5 min walk) and it is cheap, cheap cheap. You can find anything you want from groceries, drinks, toiletries to souvenirs and it will be on a fraction of the price to anywhere else.
- Caleta de Fuste is a great destination for families. If you do not like children or families, it is likely you might not enjoy yourself.
- Benefits of staying in Caleta de Fuste: Safe beaches, quiet lovely holiday village, cheaper part of the island, beautiful and dramatic views of the ocean on the north part, situated in the middle of the island so easy to travel everywhere. I would highly recommend for people with families and people with cars.
- Cons of staying in Caleta de Fuste: It is not the most beautiful part of Fuerteventura. Please do not misunderstand me, it is still very beautiful as Fuerteventura is a beautiful, beautiful island. If you like the buzz of very touristy places, if you want the breathtaking views of Jandia or Corralejo, if you want wind water sports (except for the sailing ones that were plenty here), if you want some serious partying perhaps this is not the best destination for you.
- I did not see any nudists here whereas there were in other parts of the island. Depending on your preferences this might be a con or a pro.
- Fuerteventura is a seriously beautiful place. But it is also a VERY windy place with changeable weather. Consider both when you decide on your holidays.",October 2018,"Sheraton Fuerteventura Beach, Golf & Spa Resort",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g658907-d601739-Reviews-Sheraton_Fuerteventura_Beach_Golf_Spa_Resort-Caleta_de_Fuste_Antigua_Fuerteventura_Cana.html,"Fuerteventura, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.5
Today is a thank you to member's room,"The V&A is one of my favourite places in the world and I believe one of the loveliest museums. Membership has been fantastic and I love the relaxed atmosphere of the member's room.

If nothing else visit for the garden!,"My sister strong armed me in visiting this museum and I am deeply grateful to her for it. There is nothing about this museum I did not love. All of it; the building, the collections (I loved the modern collection perhaps even more), but foremost the beautiful garden and outside space. I think it is free to visit just for the garden and it appears like the thing people who work locally or live around do. I cannot describe how beautiful it is and even photographs do not do it justice. Schedule in adequate time to visit because there is a lot to see, disproportionally so to size, and you would want to enjoy the premisses. Also, I got the ticket to see the temporary collections as well, which were great. However, there is enough to see in the museum itself and might reduce visiting time, if in a tight schedule. For me this is one of the most beautiful museums in the world. :)",May 2018,Calouste Gulbenkian Museum - Founder's Collection,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d195106-Reviews-Calouste_Gulbenkian_Museum_Founder_s_Collection-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Por.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,5.0,4.5
"If you love marionettes, a place to visit","This is a rather sophisticated museum, even though it has fun corners to play with puppets and marionettes if visiting with children.

When in London definitely come here,"The Artesian bar is one of my favourite places in London. For any cocktail lovers out there the cocktails are award winning and each an experience to be had.

The decor and surrounding are absolutely beautiful as part of the rathet magnificent Langham. The location is a throws away Oxford Circus. It is an expensive place but it does offer the luxury you would expect for the price. Also, even though it's always busy it is also quite quiet. You can both people watch but also enjoy am actual conversation with your friends.

However, for me the greatest selling point is the service. The hospitality here is of the very high quality you would expect from a place like this, polite, professional, effective, helpful. In addition, the members of staff consistently manage to get their service to the next level and come across also as genuinely friendly and warm without ever being even in the slightest overbearing.

Heart of Venice,"Going to Venice for the Carnival my friend and I thought it a great idea to book a Venetian Ball. We decided on the one that Giulia (the owner of Sogno Veneziano) organises as it appeared to have more of a personal touch. We were not wrong and in fact this is where the success of this place lies, the personal approach.

It is a family run business and the crown of this business is Giulia, who is an extraordinarily charismatic person. She has a strong artistic vision, loves what she does and brings her spirit and energy to everything. Her family is equally gifted people. With their warmth and generosity they will make you feel like a star and as part of Venice.

Giulia's creations are inspired equally by tradition, theatre and fantasy. They are fantastically complimented by Igor's out of this world headpieces and masks. I would highly recommend this place as part of your Venetian trip :)",February 2016,Sogno Veneziano Atelier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187870-d5603543-Reviews-Sogno_Veneziano_Atelier-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Couldn't be happier if I tried,"I always wanted to stay in Hilton Bosphorus because of it's history and view. As I was travelling with my mother though and wanted to take her somewhere really memorable. I was in fact exploring my options for more than a month. At the end I decided to go with the place I always had in mind and I did not regret it. Both my mother and I, think the highlight of our stay in Istanbul to be the view from our room and balcony.

I have not stayed anywhere else in Istanbul but really cannot see all things considered how any place can top the Hilton Bosphorus. The location is fantastic being only a throws away from Taxim square. Istanbul and that area is very densely build but Hilton has ample space around it that one would never expect in the city centre. The view from the top of the hill that amphitheatrically overlooks Bosphorus is optimal. The Ritz tower might have more of a bird's view but being a tower you do not have the opportunity to sit in your balcony and enjoy the sea breeze as well. It is a luxurious hotel with very well dedicated staff. Also, the outdoors pools and sports facilities are not only fantastic but also unexpected in such a central location.

I can imagine that there are more luxurious hotels in Istanbul or one might prefer Golden Horn as location. All in all, though, I cannot see how any place would be better than this hotel as it scores very well in every single aspect.",September 2015,Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293974-d294614-Reviews-Hilton_Istanbul_Bosphorus-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",hotels,5.0,4.5
Should be in best London cocktail bars list,"One can go to the Pearson Room and have a great time in the way one would expect in a place like this; optimal location, city types relaxing and socialising, seeing and being seen, luxurious set up, attention to detail, very well catered drinks menu. However, if you are up for it ask for personalised cocktails or even single drinks. Speak to the staff and if available the manager, Vincenzo. When we've been there he really made our experience unique and a night to remember with an almost impromptu drinks tasters course.

The Pearson Room staff really know their stuff (no pun intended... or just a little bit). They can explain to you everything you need to know about the drink you like or should like. They also take their time with people. In such a busy place, a true achievement.

I had a fantastic time and was really impressed by this place that could easily have gotten away by serving standard drinks and menu like many other luxury bars.

The hype is right ;),"I went to L'Astrance one of the worst days. I had a flu on top of another flu that kept me up all night and that on top of another health problem... and when things could not get worse I had side effects to the medication. Also, I went to the restaurant straight from travelling into Paris. If it wasn't for the impossible to book tables I would have cancelled a thousand times. So I was not at all set up to have a wonderful time and yet I did!

L'Astrance is rightfully thought one of the best restaurants in the world. Despite my many problems I had the extended menu and each dish was better than the one before. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and everyone appeared to have a genuinely good time. I could not have any alcohol but did have a sly sip and as expected that was also excellent!

One thing that I did not fully realise by reading reviews is how cosy and cute the place was. The staff is very friendly (yet professional) and on occasion you can see Pascal Barbot spying through the door window on us lot... very cute :)

PS. Practicalities: The price for what you get I felt was quite reasonable. However, this is a 3 Michelin star restaurant so it is towards the ££££ side.

Reservations are actually quite easy as long as you know well ahead when you plan to visit. Just give a call a couple+ of months ahead of when you want to book and they will let you know when to call exactly to make the booking. Only be careful to call on the morning of the suggested date.

Just stunning :),"KONG is such a stunning place. It splits into two floors, 5th and 6th, of the Kenzo building. The most stunning of the two is the top, which is only meant as a restaurant. Having said that, I'm not certain what happens during hours restaurant is closed.

The restaurant is shaped as a capsule with glass sides offering panoramic views. Nice :)

Decoration is beautiful and they even have their own scent.

Food is descent. Nothing to get particularly excited about, resembles quality at Louvre restaurant. Cocktails in the bar lack imagination and are prepared in a very mechanical way without true skill, but again they are descent.

Staff were quite polite and friendly with me but I can see here other people had problems. Not certain about that, I was on my own and perhaps that made a difference?

My only and main objection with the place is that given the quality of the environment they could really opt to get both their cuisine and bar up there with the best. Otherwise it is a bit of a waste. JMO.",May 2012,Kong,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d718092-Reviews-Kong-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Average or poor? Cannot really make my mind :-/,"By no means is this a bad place and I can see people really loving it, so I would definitely recommend a person gave it a try. Having said that I found that for the hype, pretensions, and pricing it left me feeling somewhat blah....

Negatives: The reservation system is bad (tomdickandharry@crap.com) and they do not take responsibility for it like you would expect from a bar in the somewhat pricey range. Unfriendly gate keepers (aka door people). Not that exciting decoration. Exceptionally mediocre floor service. In fact business idea--> send your staff to a basic hospitality and leisure course. Surprisingly it helps, when you have a business in the hospitality and leisure sector. Who would have guessed it!

Positives: Good cocktails!!! :) Not so much in the mix (I was expecting to be a little bit more awed there) but the quality of the drinks/ingredients is awesome! Actually for what you get analogically I thought they were rather cheap! The bartenders are great! They make up for the lack of experience of everybody else and I would highly recommend you get your drink from them and talk to them. If you are in your twenties (that I am not) I guess you will appreciate being in a trendy well shot after place with glitterati and other beautiful people.

So all and all not a bad place to be @, but in the category it aspires to be I would have expected more from the decoration and much much more from the service.",May 2012,Experimental Cocktail Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2410363-Reviews-Experimental_Cocktail_Club-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Pure Class,"To eat at Le Meurice was is an unforgettable experience. The food eloquently cooked by Yannick Alléno is all it is promised to be. In an environment that is quite justifiably considered one of the most beautiful restaurants in the world. That alone should suffice.

Additionaly, the service is spotless. You know you are being looked after by the best of the best in tourism and suspect they all have at least on masters degree in hospitality and speak five languages. Both attentive and discrete. Yet they are approachable and friendly.

You expect of course these high standards in a 3* restaurant located in a palace. However the high level is not what makes everything so unique. Le Meurice fills this spot in the market where you can experience old school luxury. The one you suspect bourgeoisie received in the 20s.

The staff is choreographed in their movements, dressed in designer costumes with references to best butlers and maids clothing, assistants carrying large heavy trays, golden and silver gilded cutlery, luxurious furniture and décor, all synthesise an overall feeling of intelligence and nostalgia.

Was it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely.

PS. At the end of a very long and fulfilling meal the assistant manager took the time to have a little chat with me. This was a brilliant person and it really contributed to a perfect finish to a perfect afternoon :)",May 2011,Restaurant Le Meurice Alain Ducasse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d719160-Reviews-Restaurant_Le_Meurice_Alain_Ducasse-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Perfect of purpose :D,"I loved this little hostel! For starters it is perfectly located just on the corner from Sacré Cœur. The northern (I think it is the northern- for sure it is the one side of the hostel) faces Sacré Cœur and has a panoramic view of it.

There is a lift, bar, pool table, 24hs reception, lounge, and restaurant. My favourite of them all is a patio with a view to Sacré Cœur and happy noises from the street bellow and birds singing in the trees. Had my breakfasts (included in the price) there. Some lucky residents had rooms with entrance on the patio.

Staff is very friendly and helpful. Front door is locked at all times and you can only get in and out by reception. Reception also safe-keeps valuables. I highly recomend that you do leave all your valuables with them! All rooms have electronic locks, however touristy places always have very skilled thieves!

Tips:
1) Not a good destination if you want a very quiet place. This is a touristy area, so if your room faces the road there will be street noises (no drunks or loud gangs though).
2) The showers have 24hs hot water, however they are annoyingly controlled by button. This means you need to keep pressing every so little for the water to flow.
3) The place is cleaned daily, I do suspect though some cleaners do not sweep under the beds. You might want to check that and report to reception.
4) There are no lockers on the rooms. I wish they had them but they don't. Remember to have a lock for your bags.

I cannot decide whether it was extremely kitsch or simply magnificent. One man's lifelong dream materialising in a dramatic decadent décor for the likes of people like Lord Byron.
