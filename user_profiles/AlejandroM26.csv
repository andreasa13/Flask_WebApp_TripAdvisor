Nice Hotel great staff,"We, a party of 5 expended 5 days at this hotel, installations are good, nice pool and spa area, great breakfast buffet, unfortunately is not close to center however a 10 minutes bus ride will take you there.

There is a great “churrascaria” in the next block, inexpensive and quality food.

I recommend this hotel with no doubts",September 2019,Belver Beta Porto Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189180-d248872-Reviews-Belver_Beta_Porto_Hotel-Porto_Porto_District_Northern_Portugal.html,"Porto, Portugal",hotels,5.0,2.5
Colombian corner in Amsterdam,"A true Colombian place in the middle of Amsterdam, walking distance from Dam Plaza, 100% Colombian food, they have “sancocho” on weekends and attention is A+, I recommend this place on your visit to Amsterdam",October 2019,Tropico Latin Flavors,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188590-d8609413-Reviews-Tropico_Latin_Flavors-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Awesome encounter with history,"Recommend to go early to avoid large groups...

Entrance ticket 20€ pp worth it to pay, is a monument to the humanity.",April 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Awesome surprise,"Awesome surprise in Athens, close to metro station and places for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Excellent service, great teamwork, profesional staff delivering a great job; rooms are quite small bur good enough if you are organized and set up your stuff in an efficient way.

The front desk lady is so friendly and helpful.

I highly recommend this place",April 2019,White Lotus Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d4840645-Reviews-White_Lotus_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Great Discovery in Jerusalem,"Nice place for dinner; we had a menu for two people including grill chicken and meat, plus different type of regional salads, pita bread, coke and a couple of coffee for US $50.00

Cozy environment, nice jazz and chill out music....the attendant speaks fluent english and is so charismatic and kind.

We will be back before the end of our trip, place highly recommended...",December 2018,Grill House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293983-d11903483-Reviews-Grill_House-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Not recomended,"Disappointed, even though the property is located close to many attractions, the place is old and low maintained.

No electronic key access to the room, no safety box, lots of mildew in the bathroom, no hangers in a broken closet door, no remote control for tv etc etc etc

Room has a glass door access to the patio and a broken screen door which makes us feel very insecure.

Beds are too low, my 53 cm tall carry on suitcase is taller than bed, which makes it very uncomfortable.

The blanket is dirty, picture don’t capture the brownish color at the edges.

We requested another room and been told to talk to the am front desk assistant.

We are looking for another hotel around, which will make us pay twice our stay in Jerusalem...... at this point we almost lost all the magic of this beautiful part of the world.

NOT RECOMMENDED at all

Awesome surprise,"We ended up at the trattoria acqua in bocca due to their schedule, on weekends they don’t close between lunch and dinner time.... we thought we’ll get some pizzas but we got surprised when we found out we had the whole menu available.... they have bilingual staff, great food, even though they don’t have english menu, they translated for us and we had a blast..... pizzas a must!!! and real carbonara!!!

Highly recomended !!!",November 2018,Acqua in Bocca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d15329186-Reviews-Acqua_in_Bocca-Madrid.html,"Madrid, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
