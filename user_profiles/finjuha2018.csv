"Big surprise, awesome end !","We ended up here by accident when choosing a hotel. But it became clear we found something out of ordinary. The hotel is on an island close to the capital but feels like you are on distant rural landscape surrounded by the sea. Every room has a sea view. The building remind me of the 70's era and is renovated with respect. Rooms are big and light, beds are the best you can have, bathrooms modern and stylish. Sauna and specially the pool is amazing with deep blue tiles and the direct sea view where you have access from the pool by walking.
Breakfast was good and generous with everything basic you need.
Dinner is real cuisine with Nordic menu including Reindeer ofcourse.
Staff is very helpful and friendly, and we got extra special thing when we took the second night, thanks ;-) !
If you wish something out of ordinary then this is definitely for you ! Read the history and study the architecture yourself, details will amaze you, it isn't just a hotel !",September 2019,Hotel Hanaholmen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189932-d238713-Reviews-Hotel_Hanaholmen-Espoo_Uusimaa.html,"Espoo, Finland",hotels,5.0,4.5
Nice panoramic views.,"Walk up is easy since there are many long steps and along the way good views. By car there is a big spot and short walk up. You may aswell take the cable car for 5€ and walk down.
Views are over the Athens to all directions. Take binoculars or zoom camera for nice shots. There's also a restaurant with surprisingly low prices, like 0.5l water bottle 50 cents..
Worth the visit if the weather is good.",March 2019,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good and tasty food.,"Very good food, nice staff, nice restaurant. We went there 2nd time and realized that many others were there with us like last night, so the restaurant is good if you go there twice in a row. I took calf beef and it was great, big portion of meat and salads are great too. They offered small drinks afterwards before the bill, for free. Food is excellent and pricing is moderate. Fast service, friendly staff, cozy. Best restaurant we had in a week in Athens.",March 2019,MIRONI Greek Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14072280-Reviews-MIRONI_Greek_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good hotel but some drawbacks.,"Hotel situates next to a busy street so traffic noise can be annoying even on 5th floor, and the surrounding area is not nice, abandoned big houses and graffiti on every wall, dark alleys and unfriendly looking neighborhood. Don't take fully dark side alleys on night, common hang around places for homeless or junkies. Rooms are with very thin walls so you can clearly hear conversations on next room.

Breakfast is very good and rich. Rooms modern, clean and tidy. Beds comfortable and 200cm long at least. Rooms cleaned every day. Staff is friendly and English speaking. Near the Hotel you find restaurants with good food but the hotel restaurant is exceptionally good on top floor with amazing view to the Acropolis hill. If you have the street side room, from your balcony you have the Acropolis view too. Metro near by to reach the whole town. Despite the neighborhood we did not find it dangerous or threatening. Just be aware where you're going.",March 2019,Polis Grand Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d570105-Reviews-Polis_Grand_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.0
Must to see!,"If you go to Athens, you can't avoid seeing Parthenon, it overlooks the whole city. Its perfectly illuminated during the night and it blows your mind when seeing it close. Its packed with history. Sadly it is destroyed by many wars, looting and time. Lucky it is not forgotten and fully destroyed like many other monuments.",March 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Maybe the best museum I've ever visited.,The museum is beautifully built on a perfect spot where you can fully see Parthenon temple. Museum is built with style and with high quality materials. Most of the artifacts are displayed as they were in the Temple of Parthenon. Good background for all items. The architect has done magnificent job.,March 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Absolute must to visit.,"You can't miss this, it overlooks Athens where ever you are in the town. It's presence is almost unreal, magical, mystic, still real part of the development of human civilization.
The site is amazing combo of antique and modern Athens below the rock. As you can guess its touristic but only behind the gates, inside its very well kept original. Bring your own water or buy it 6 times more expensive on site. On March weather was pleasant, on July it is 40degrees!
If you go here, visiting the Acropolis museum is a must too.",March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Just get there and enjoy.,"After wondering around the Gamla Stan and looking for a restaurant, we ended to here. We ordered Ox and Herring, they also made a small salad for us out from the menu, how nice. Food was just excellent and portions were enough big to fill you hungry needs at very moderate price.",October 2018,Slingerbulten,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189852-d1580290-Reviews-Slingerbulten-Stockholm.html,"Stockholm, Sweden",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Below average,"Positive: Rooms and bathroom clean, good location, beach is near by, good parking, beds are okay, Wifi, airco works.

Negative:
Rooms are with paper thin walls so you hear everything around you, no English speaking staff, no fridge in the room, really poor breakfast.

It's okay small hotel but beware the restaurant. We were there with few other groups, mostly Italian. 15 minutes waiting so they can make a one table in a half empty restaurant, half hour we waited for menu, after half hour later someone came to see us but he couldn't take our order, so came a lady. We got no bread like other tables, red wine was not what we ordered and came in an ice bucket !?! I got old lasagne, dry and warmed in a microwave. Pizza was ok. After eating they brought our green salad(!?)which was way too late and not what we ordered so we sent it back. The situation was absurd, whole staff was wondering around doing nothing but organising plates and glasses when quests waited for attention. Everyone was looking other tables and rolling their heads. Staff had no clue how to work in a restaurant. Nobody asked if someone wants coffee or desserts so all groups left without.
Breakfast the same, really bizarre behaviour from staff again. Plates were immediately empty and nobody filled them even that it was still 9 o'clock, so many left without eating. Again staff (1 guy) was wondering around doing nothing but carrying coffee to tables but buffet plates were all empty. Breakfast was anyway really poor.
Just skip the restaurant and go to the village near by. If you can handle the coffee-only breakfast then fine, else go to the village to eat.",July 2018,Bellamarina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g776131-d4406344-Reviews-Bellamarina-Sorso_Province_of_Sassari_Sardinia.html,"Sardinia, Italy",hotels,2.0,4.0
