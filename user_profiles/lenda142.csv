Great hotel with a perfect locatiin,"The hotel itself is on a great location, 100 meters from one of Hungary's most famous squares, Heroes square. Metro line is located at the very beginning of Andrassy avenue which leads you to the center in couple of minutes. Tickets are a bit tricky to get mostly because ticket window does not work on every station.
A classic room has 2 beds, a TV without usb input, so everyone bringing media on USB won't be able to have a movie night before sleep. Room is equiped with a chair and a spacious workdesk. Shower cabine is nice and clean, big enough for 2 persons. Rooms are clean and so are walls. Bathroom also has a hair dryer with integrated socket for a shaving machine and 2 towels. You are also included a breakfast wich is very basic with some traditional meals like sauces, sousages, cgeese, ham and various spreads.
Room also has a safe for personal belongings and a big enough wardrobe.",January 2020,Ibis Budapest Heroes Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274887-d276374-Reviews-Ibis_Budapest_Heroes_Square-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",hotels,5.0,4.0
