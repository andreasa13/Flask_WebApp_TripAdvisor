Creme de la creme!,"This restaurant is simply superb! The service is impeccable, no detail goes unnoticed, and the food is creative and inspired. We had the 3 course prix fixe for my birthday,and we got an additional chocolate cake for dessert! The tables are well spaced, the dining room is carpeted and quiet, and the room elegant. We enjoyed the white asparagus and the peekytoe crab appetizers followed by chicken stuffed with crab mousseline and accompanied by fresh morels and sautéed spinach. Desserts were equally elaborate and tasty. My spouse had the wine pairings for each course and I enjoyed a lovely Chablis and a Tokaji with my strawberry dessert.

"Very good food, brisk service!","I like the food at Barbaresco a lot. I just wish that the wait staff wouldn’t be quite so eager to take my drink order before I even get my jacket off and get settled! Once we’re seated, the pace is efficient but not quite as hurried. We enjoyed their version of veal saltimbocca and the chicken in a Gorgonzola cream cause are well as the Caesar salad and the caprese one.

"Food acceptable, but crowded, noisy and slow service!","We dined here on a Sunday night which was probably our first mistake. Seating options were initially inside or on the sidewalk which didn’t appeal so we agreed to the garden. It was downstairs, not a garden or a patio, but an enclosed room with some dividers, but lots of tables, no real air circulation, and very noisy! A bigger mistake. It filled up and we felt somewhat trapped, plus the service was abysmally slow. Our waitress tried somewhat, but also said the kitchen was dealing with a lot of delivery orders. We almost left after our salad arrived, but stuck it out. The sole with lemon caper sauce was quite nice as was their veal Buon Gusto style. Accompanying broccoli was overcooked.",May 2021,Caffe Buon Gusto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d479315-Reviews-Caffe_Buon_Gusto-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Favorite dining spot!,"Via Carota is only serving in their outdoor enclosure and reservations are very limited and hard to get. Nonetheless, we had an early lunch slot and delighted in two longtime favorites: grilled artichokes and the Meyer lemon risotto. The artichokes are my spouse’s favorite and I consider their risotto food for the gods. It satisfies on so many levels. In addition, we enjoyed the fritto misto, although I thought it was a tad on the dry side and could have been cooked a bit less and/or served with more lemon wedges or some aioli. They are encouraging ordering on your phone, but they will also give you a paper menu. Now we know to use our phones for the next visit!",April 2021,Via Carota,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d7289152-Reviews-Via_Carota-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Delicious Turkish food!,"With a wide variety of choices and a very friendly, helpful waitress, this was a fun place for dinner. We sat outside on the sidewalk, nicely distanced from the other outdoor tables. The hot red pepper and walnut spread was very hot, but my spouse really liked it! Between us, we shared an order of the manti, lovely mini dumplings in yogurt sauce, and the lamb shish kebab plus an additional order of greens. Everything very tasty!

Always a pleasure for good food!,"We sat upstairs inside since it was very windy on their porch. An almost full dining room, but good service nonetheless.

Expanded outdoor seating along with FRESH fish!,"The food at Swordfish Grill is a cut above that of some other casual local restaurants. We enjoyed the firecracker shrimp, and shared a Caesar salad which gave the two of us each a nice serving. My spouse had the seared tuna and I tucked into the salmon tacos, a special that day. Two flour tortillas with a generous amount of salmon and tasty slaw. Seating options include under an overhang, in the open toward the bay or inside completely protected.

"Charming, historic restaurant for breakfast or lunch","We were on our first visit to Arcadia and this little place and the warm welcome we received. It was early for lunch, but our waitress assured us we could order lunch sandwiches if we chose. And we did--ham and cheese with fries, and for me, a tuna melt with a side green salad. There are old-fashioned side boards or buffets, cut glass items and plenty of china tea pots on display along with old-time ladies and men's hats.
There was one other diner there and our table was far away from hers so we felt very comfortable. And since they make their own scones and baklava, we bought some to have at home.

Definitely a place to put on our return list!",December 2019,Bella Blu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d491116-Reviews-Bella_Blu-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great exhibits in this small gem!,"One might not realize that this private club dedicated to books and book publishing opens its exhibits to the public. And for no charge whatsoever. We visited expressly to see the “500 Years of Works by Women” and it was well worth it. Consisting of selections from a massive collection of printed works from the 16th century onward, it is drawn from the Baskin collection at Duke University. There are lovely examples of printing and binding by women as well as numerous books written by women. This exhibit is on into early February and there was a smaller exhibit on the upper floor as well.",December 2019,Grolier Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d11882711-Reviews-Grolier_Club-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",attractions,5.0,4.0
Very good food; overlook the brusque service,"We are always pleased with the food here, but do occasionally mind the brusqueness of some of the wait staff. There’s a peremptory quality to it and you can feel almost attacked as soon as you are seated. Make up your mind quickly about what you’d like to drink, then you can peruse the menu in a more relaxed manner. That said, our waiter this time was very good and we enjoyed two veal dishes plus a side order of the gnocchi with Gorgonzola cream sauce. The latter were good, but would have been even better with even more of the cheese. A popular place that works to turn their tables efficiently so reservations are highly recommended.",December 2019,Barbaresco,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1006965-Reviews-Barbaresco-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
One of our favorite UES restaurants for everyday dining!,"A cozy restaurant with consistently good service and food. We like the 3-course prix-fixe which has a nice selection of choices. The roast chicken is always good as is the salmon with green beans and white beans. And on the regular menu, there’s also a tasty chicken paillard with greens and always a soup du jour. The red pepper soup the other night was especially tasty!",December 2019,Sel et Poivre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d423823-Reviews-Sel_et_Poivre-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
One of the friendliest diners around!,We love the warm welcome given as we enter! Great service all around and one of the best iterations of a grilled bacon and cheese. The tuna melt on an English muffin is quite good also.,December 2019,Eat Here Now,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d423939-Reviews-Eat_Here_Now-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Zippy food in a lively space!,"This tapas place is popular, especially with the younger crowd. We dined here on a Friday night and found the tapas we ordered delicious! The shrimps in olive oil and garlic, the patatas brava, and the citrus salad (loved the combo of grapefruit, manchego and fennel) were all tasty. Note that all the seating is at high tables (a challenge for us shorties) and there is loud music. We were right under a speaker.",December 2019,Boqueria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d6017528-Reviews-Boqueria-New_York_City_New_York.html,"New York City, New York",restaurants,4.0,4.0

Great tour of this former hotel!,"This hour-long tour is led by a current student and the young woman who gave our tour was knowledgeable and fun. Formerly the Ponce de Leon Hotel, this is a very grand building with Tiffany glass and luxurious furnishings throughout.

Mixed bag on this main drag,"Some of St. George Street is very nice, but there are a lot of tacky tourist shops and oodles of bars and pubs that detract a bit from the wonderfully historic architecture. Lots of history here, but you have to work and walk a bit to discover it. The square right off St. George Street was in full Christmas mode with four live Christmas trees each decorated differently, Christmas lights, a sleigh, a snowman and even a penguin. Walk it, but do realize that there are many other intriguing sights around this district!",December 2019,St. George Street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34599-d199044-Reviews-St_George_Street-St_Augustine_Florida.html,"St. Augustine, Florida",attractions,3.0,4.5
Cozy pub for lunch!,"We were the only diners at lunch time and wondered how the food would be. But, we were pleased that both the food and the service were very good. The crab cakes with accompaniment were tasty and the chicken pesto burrito was excellent.

Wide range of rooms usually above retail stores,"The inn owns six buildings (mix of old and new) around the historic district and some of the rooms are slightly funky. We were in one of the older buildings with a balcony and a king size bed. Right outside was a row of air conditioners, but because we weren’t there in the summer, the room was quiet. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom had sink in ante area. Hotel staff were exceptionally welcoming and friendly and the breakfast that came with the room was a mini buffet of pastry, fruit, a cheese, ham and salami and granola. Very nice. For future stays, the staff advised us to look at the photos of the rooms online before booking.",December 2019,St. George Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34599-d278190-Reviews-St_George_Inn-St_Augustine_Florida.html,"St. Augustine, Florida",hotels,4.0,4.5
Wonderfully fresh fish and great flavors!,"This casual place has wood tables and an informal vibe. We loved the trio of dips (pico de gallo, guacamole and pimento fondue) with chips to start. Our guys sampled the delicious Minorcan seafood chowder. The flounder on risotto was different and exceptionally wonderful. Great service and a fun place to dine.",December 2019,Catch 27,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34599-d9581772-Reviews-Catch_27-St_Augustine_Florida.html,"St. Augustine, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.5

The place to see and be seen for lunch in Ocala!,"I think this may be part of a chain (there’s a Harry’s in St. Augustine), but it was very good and the service lightning quick. We told our waitress we were on a tight timeline and she delivered our food super fast. The salmon salad was tasty, if a bit overdressed and our companions all liked what they ordered as well.

Small gem of a museum!,"Just outside the small city of Ocala in north central Florida, the Appleton is a very attractive modern building.
