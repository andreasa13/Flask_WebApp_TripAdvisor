Hallway room,"So again managed to have an interesting room in a hotel. It was a small room on the first floor in the main corridor with two doors and someone living on the other side.
However, after getting used to the room and my neighbours long telephone conversations I could clearly hear, the hotel was nice.

Breakfast was lovely with everything freshly served, coffee was really good and morning service just lovely and friendly.
I loved that they had fresh cold water every day in the room and free apples in the main hall promoting healthier choices.

Location was excellent and having a courtyard facing room, sleep quality was nice (until 6am when the staff woke up and started taking things from the maintenance room just across the hall).",November 2019,Hotel Wettstein,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188049-d506840-Reviews-Hotel_Wettstein-Basel.html,"Basel, Switzerland",hotels,3.0,4.0

Sleeping in an aeroplane,"My room was next to the main ventilation of the building. No further comments are probably needed, nevertheless.

I asked to change the room because after travelling for 12 hours I could not stand the constant loud ventilation system noise, but I was told the hotel is full. Also it was not possible to turn it off like some hotels do.
Unfortunately the ventilation system of the conference room was as loud as in the room, so by the end of my stay I had a terrible headache from this aeroplane like hotel.

My room was small near to the elevators that were equipped with noise alerts that I could hear clearly throughout my stay. There were plastic cups in the bathroom (hard to say why they can't use regular cups and care for the environment?), no conditioner and no view.
Breakfast and dinner was totally average. Coffee was totally terrible.
They of course had a little bit better coffee if you agreed to pay over 5 euros for a small cup.

Only nice thing about the hotel was the rooftop terrace bar. There I would go again but only to sit outside and have a nice drink.

Excellent spa hotel in Estonia,"We went there for a romantic weekend and booked a deluxe room.
When we arrived nice cold bubbly with a fruit platter and candles (electric) were waiting for us. The room was definitely fun, as it had see through glass between the room and the bath. If looking for romance this is definitely a feature to appreciate. (You could of course block the view with a curtain if necessary).

Our room faced the courtyard and had no view, but probably this is something you can discuss before booking.

The spa is just the best I have been to in Estonia. I love the saunas there and believe that they probably have the best choice in Estonia. I definitely recommend to participate in the rituals that are just lovely and refreshing experiences.

At 21:30 we had booked a romantic dinner in their restaurant, that was also just perfect! Food was great, service was excellent and atmosphere really lovely and chick.

As the hotel is located in the middle of the city this is also the best place if you would like to explore Tartu and go shopping.

Thank you!",August 2019,V Spa & Conference Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274959-d11697330-Reviews-V_Spa_Conference_Hotel-Tartu_Tartu_County.html,"Tartu, Estonia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Relaxing spa hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay there. Having travelled for 6 hours I was happy to land at the relaxing spa area right after checking in. The pool and sauna area is truly cosy and appealing.
The hotel has excellent location when you are travelling by bus, as the bus station is just across the street. Also the old town, nice cafes and shops are really close.
The room and lounge was chic and clean. However the breakfast area was strangely old fashioned and out of the context. Breakfast itself was just ok. However coffee was horrible. My recommendation for all hotels is - please buy some good quality coffee beans! It is not that expensive and means the world to a traveller.
So does a lovely breakfast area.
I really would recommend updating this area.",May 2019,Wellton Centrum Hotel & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274967-d4828375-Reviews-Wellton_Centrum_Hotel_Spa-Riga_Riga_Region.html,"Riga, Latvia",hotels,4.0,4.5
"Location, breakfast, location :)","So this hotel has very many nice features:
1. Adorable, delicious breakfast!!!! (try the scrambled eggs and pancakes even if you are not a morning eater!:)
2. Perfect location!
3. Lovely and chic interior
4. Bike rental
5. Lovely staff

It also has some features that might not be exactly my cup of tea:
1. Rooms are facing courtyard and all the windows of other rooms. Unfortunately it is not the best feature as I really appreciate a nice view and my privacy when in hotel.
2. The rooms are not soundproof. I could hear my neighbour unzipping his briefcase.
My other neighbour was unfortunately ill with a bad cough that lasted through 3 nights.

But when you want just a bed for a little while, a perfect location and absolutely delicious breakfast, then this hotel is an excellent choice!

There is one remark for the hotel staff. One morning I witnessed an incident between a guest and a staff member at the breakfast area. I did not understand the issue, but the guest was truly rude and threatened the staff member with horrific threats. Staff remained polite and the girls from front desk and breakfast area solved the situation quickly by removing the involved staff member from breakfast area.
However considering how agressive the guest was I would recommend the hotel to have a policy to remove these kind of guests from the hotel. No matter the issue.
The safety of staff and other guests must be a priority for the hotel.",April 2019,Hotel Van De Vijsel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188590-d13879807-Reviews-Hotel_Van_De_Vijsel-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",hotels,4.0,4.0
Yes please!,"So I had a lovely-lovely experience with Clarion I'd like to share.
Having a somewhat strange travelling schedule I arrived at Helsinki airport at 6 am with work duties only late in the evening.
The thought of spending the whole day wondering the dark, cold and snowy streets of Helsinki was really not appealing at 6 am. So I decided to take a chance with this new hotel wishing I could try out their breakfast and lovely spa area.
At first the receptionist told me that spa was only for guests ;(...... BUT! immediately another lovely girl at the reception offered me to take a room for a day with everything included. I just loved the idea!
For a very reasonable amount of money I enjoyed their luxurious breakfast, lovely sauna and outdoor pool on 16th floor (accompanied by snowfall) and had a really nice beauty sleep in the middle of the day.
I also really enjoyed that they had good quality Rituals soaps and shampoos in the room as well as in the sauna area, good bed and lovely view from the room.
At 16 pm I checked out as good as new and was ready for my work thing.

Sweet scent of Paris,"This is a really sweet place if you are looking for an authentic experience.
It is a small hotel with small and tastefully decorated rooms that cater to all your needs.
I just loved that we were provided with fresh bottled water every day and that complimentary snack bar was open until late at night. It was modest, but enough for a quick sugar boost. Overall this hotel made us feel very welcome in Paris.

Disappointig experience,When checking in to our flight from Riga to Rome (flight BT633) online Air Baltic offered an option to pay extra for the seats so we could sit together. We took it. Unfortunately when entering the plane the seats were changed at the gate so that we were not able to sit together. We asked how could this be when we have payed extra but the flight attendant shrugged her shoulders and said that she cannot help us.So we payed about 40 euros for nothing.

Glimpse of lovely Rome,"So if I am going to Rome again, I will definitely choose this location over any other region.
If you love to walk, you can easily get to Vatican, Colosseum, best food district, marketplace, local designers shops ect. Really good glimpse of romantic and lovely Rome.

Hotel was clean and had a lovely rooftop terrace. Bed was good and bathtub big enough to fit 2 persons.

Only thing that unfortunately ruined our first night was intensive ventilation noise throughout the night, similar to the noise in an airplane.
When we complained in the morning it turned out that the person responsible for shutting the ventilation down for the night had forgotten to do so.
So I learned my lesson and hopefully will be more eager to complain earlier the next time. It would have saved me one night of not sleeping.

As it is quite expensive hotel I hoped that they will somehow apologize or try to compensate for their mistake but nobody at the reception was interested.

Good stay,"Although we spent one very short night at hotel Bologna we were really happy about the service.
Despite arriving late at night, we were greeted by friendly staff, good vine and chips.
Thank you so much!

Our room was clean and cosy. The only thing was that our room had no window with access to natural light. This probably is no issue to many people, but if I went there the next time, I definitely would ask for this feature.

Classic Tuscany getaway,"The place is absolutely beautiful. Classic olive trees, fantastic view, plenty of cosy corners to relax and enjoy fabulous wine.

We stayed there for 3 nights. We had lovely breakfast on the terrace and enjoyed pool area sunbathing. Just beautiful!

We also had dinner there, but unfortunately it did not meet our expectations.
Meat was slender and had good texture, however there was no seasoning and promised vegetables for four people were 4 leaves of bitter and practically burnt cabbage.
The dessert ""fruits of the garden"" were few slices of banana, kiwi and apple with miniature scoop of lemon ice-cream. If I had not known better, I would have thought that my friends were making fun of me, as I am big Italian food/dessert lover. Unfortunately it was no joke.

Tourist trap,I was not impressed by this place. Seafood seemed to be dead for a while and the basement where we ended up eating needs serious remodelling. Wine was ok as well as service.

No need to go there!,"So let me describe you the service -
Waiter brought us drinks with drinks dripping all over the place. He did not mind. We started drying the glasses and our table with napkins on the table. Then the waiter came back but instead of helping us or addressing his clumsiness, he took away the napkin set from the table and walked away.

As for food: Miniburger was made from dry cold bun and was served with a plastic ketchup container so you could swallow it. Not impressive at all!

Excellent choice!,"After years of travelling I finally found the perfect room I have been searching for in all hotels. The room was cosy and elegant with excellent bed and chic bathroom. I loved the small balcony and breathtaking view over the park.

It is one of a kind hotel promoting healthy lifestyle. You can get very healthy breakfast of fresh fruit, detox drinks and smoothies, go for a run in the mornings as you are located just next to a lovely park and rent bikes for exploring the city.

As I always consider safety to be an issue when travelling I was happy to find this area to be really safe. There were many people jogging in the park even late at night so definitely pack your sneakers.

The hotel is also within walking distance from the hip part of the city packed with tapas ect dinner places and cool shops. I do not recommend travelling with hand luggage, as at the end of your stay might not fit all the great stuff you can find there.

After staying there for 5 days I noticed some possibilities to improve service. As I will definitely return I will put them out there:
1. A complimentary bottle of water every day in the room would be very good idea.
If not possible, please consider changing the water offered downstairs. It probably was tap water with orange. Unfortunately the orange was not able to kill the unpleasant taste of tap.
2. In the reception area you have quite strong smell of some chemical airfreshener or cleaning solution. Please consider removing or changing it.
3. Sometimes the smoothies at breakfast were fermenting. Maybe it was ment to be, but perhaps they should be ordered the same way as the omlet/scrambled eggs, so they would be fresh for every guest.
4. There was shampoo in the room, but no conditioner. Ladies tend to really miss it!

But otherwise. Thank you so much!",April 2018,Petit Palace Savoy Alfonso XII Plus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187514-d2145876-Reviews-Petit_Palace_Savoy_Alfonso_XII_Plus-Madrid.html,"Madrid, Spain",hotels,5.0,4.5
Summer resort with winter benefits,"Usually summer resorts die during winter time, but luckily not this one.
Even in January you can enjoy this beautiful hotel, with great steam sauna and lovely hotel rooms, take long walks on the beach and enjoy great food served in small classy restaurants. And if you wish, a big waterpark for kids is just 10 minutes walk from the hotel.
At the hotel we had a family room, with bunk bed and I have to say that the solution was great. Small room with a bunk bed was hidden behind a wall, leaving parents enough privacy to relax and enjoy the weekend. Lounge area was lovely and food totally ok.
The only thing that had died was my tiramisu served in the lobby, but as wine was good, I didn't care much.

As for service - most of the waiters were really, really slow. However you could always almost find somebody, who was a little bit quicker to address your request.

One funny thing however - when I needed an extra card for my room nobody asked for my name or ID or anything. Also my kid managed to ask for a (wrong!!!) room card with nobody questioning her intent. This is definitely a thing the management should address because how can you be sure that there is not a questionable intent behind the request.",January 2018,Semarah Hotel Lielupe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274964-d288796-Reviews-Semarah_Hotel_Lielupe-Jurmala_Riga_Region.html,"Jurmala, Latvia",hotels,5.0,4.5
Emotion for keeps,"This is one fabulous place in Milan! It gives you an opportunity to sense the history, traditions and delights of Italy. The rooms are perfectly assembled and designed.
I almost shed a tear when I saw a romantic bath in my room and realized that they have the best water pressure in Europe. The bath was full of water before I got undressed! Amazing!
Also they had a decent queen bed with enough pillows to feel like the queen's cat.
Breakfast was adorable with warm croissants, chocolate buns, fresh fruit and tasty coffee!
Location is just perfect - just in the centre with excellent access everywhere.
Perhaps the only negative thing was that as my window faced the street I was able to hear all the garbage trucks parading the street several hours every night.

We let him pick our dinner menu and recommend the wine and we were really happy with our travel experience!

"Great food, cosy lobby and a bed to sleep in","So it is no secret that I am used to hotels above average and therefore tend to have quite high expectations for this kind of hotels. I have to say that at first I was really put off by the common toilets near the reception - dirty toilet paper was on the floor in every cabin and the overall look was something I'd rather expect at an airport or bus station toilet.
Also my room turned out to be a little gloomy and outdated.

However, after few days, the hotel grew on me. I did not spend much time in my room but instead enjoyed the breakfast area, the food, the lobby and the beautiful pool area.
I loved that the pool was open 24/7 so I always found a time to have a lovely refreshing swim. Also I was really happy to see that in the lobby they had a bookshelf - a simple way to make every traveller feel at home and find themselves an interesting book for a few hours.
And you know what made me really appreciate this hotel - when I asked for an EU adapter from the reception, they gave me one! This is really exceptional!

I was a little disappointed that they did not have a bathrobe in the room so I had to dress every time I wanted to go for a swim, but may be if I had asked them, they would have helped me. Don't know as I did not ask.

Overall I would definitely stay there again, ask for a bathrobe, an upgrade and spend a week more!",October 2017,Hilton Nicosia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190383-d272800-Reviews-Hilton_Nicosia-Nicosia_Nicosia_District.html,"Nicosia, Cyprus",hotels,4.0,4.5

And of all the places in the world I thought that this would not be a problem at Jamie's. But no! The waiter was really surprised when I asked for some olives. Confused by my request he asked another waiter and also the kitchen, what to do with my outrageous request. So guess what, they could not find me 10 nor 5 nor 3 olives to have with my wine.

Disappontment,"Disappointment= sadness or displeasure caused by the non-fulfilment of one's hopes or expectations (web definition)

OMG! I had such high expectations as this was the one and only time I really wanted a break.

There were so many mix-ups with the booking, the bill, the room.

We booked connected rooms - when arriving nothing was available.
We asked a discount for that - but they ""accidentally"" charged us 100€!!! more.

Spa? Small, cold and crowded with nowhere to sit. 1 pool full of people and children! No quiet time, no privacy!
Outside pool? 50 cm deep. Really? Or did I just swim in the fountain?

Want something more?- pay 20€ to get to the quiet spa. We did pay, but again there are million more people with no quiet time. Want a leg bath? - there are two! basins for that and about 20 legs waiting

"You can definitely feel, see and enjoy the effort put into this hotel","The one and only hotel where my room did not feel like a standard boring stay-one-night-and-leave room.
I just loved it! I loved the bed, the painting on the wall, the grey color scheme in the bathroom, wooden floor and really soft carpet (not a usual thing in hotels!)
It just felt like at home or at a good friends house.
I understand that all the rooms are different so don't know if every room is so perfect, but the room on the 3rd floor just straight from the elevator is definitely my all time favorite.
If you wonder if there were disturbing noises coming from the elevator, then you are mistaken. I did not hear a thing!
In addition to everything mentioned I loved the fact that they always had fresh fruit at the reception. Thank you! And also that they had a fantastic terrace where to enjoy vine and good company.

I'll be back? Doubt it!,"I stayed there for 2 nights and 3 days and every day I had problems with water.
I was not able to shower as I only had burning hot water coming from the tab.
First day there was a young man, who lovingly reset the water pump and afterwards came up to check if it had worked. It was really nice. Thank you.
The other day young ladies at the reception had no idea what to do, however after doing something with the pump again I had some ""not so hot water"" and was able to almost shower. Third day I was tired of having the same conversation and let it slide.

Another problem revealed itself by the next morning as it turned out the electric! water kettle on the table leaked. Luckily they had a tray under the kettle, that saved my mac from drowning during night. Thank you for that!

Minor things, like not having an electric socket near the mirror (women know how important it is) and having holes in the bedsheets were probably my smallest problems. However I believe they are definitely not part of a 4 star hotel service!
From the upside, view from my room was nice, breakfast totally OK in a spacious room and staff mostly lovely.
However the conversation at check-out was totally unique- or ""uncomplicated"" as the hotel states its values on the web page.
Clerk: ""Did you enjoy your stay here?""
Me: ""Not so much.""
Clerk: ""Well, perfect.""

On their web page they seem to have a sense of humor though: ""if it isn't right the first time, turning left three times is also right!""

1.Cosy, friendly and clean atmosphere
2. Sanarium - i could stay there for hours and not get tired of it
3. Vie 3 D facial - it does work! and feels absolutely fabulous
4. Friendly and helpful staff- despite having to deal with too many children during this week and working really long days, they are always at their best
5. The lounge area - I enjoyed my evening there with a glass of wine, best chocolate cake in the area and a good book. Fantastic.
6. Their event planner - they had planned a lot of various activities for kids every day - THANK YOU!!! What a fabulous idea to make all the parents enjoy their stay.

Besides all the good stuff there were some things I think they should reconsider:

1. There was no possibility to make yourself a cup of tea in your room.
Even most of the low priced hotels offer you a complimentary cookie and a tea variety in your room.
Considering that this is a spa hotel - this possibility should definitely be present in the room! (after a massage everyone needs it!)

2. There was no extras in the room! No cotton pads, no shampoo, conditioner or body lotion. Again most of the hotels do have these, and not just the ""dry your skin and hair away until they fall off"" soap that waited me there this time.
It sort of even made me sad, because in Estonia there are many local cosmetic companies they could use and again, this is a spa hotel!

Considering quite high fee for the night (155€ per night) I really was surprised that these basic aspects were the one that they failed to provide. Detalis matter as usual!",October 2016,Georg Ots Spa Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g664641-d506930-Reviews-Georg_Ots_Spa_Hotel-Kuressaare_Saaremaa_Saare_County.html,"Saaremaa, Estonia",hotels,4.0,4.5
A place that makes you feel beautiful!,"Pack your best high heeled shoes, most beautiful dress and bring all of your jewellery, because this is the place to wear them.
This is the hotel where you can feel beautiful and appreciated.
There are lovely ladies helping you to make your bed before going to sleep, good looking guys with red roses bringing your breakfast in bed and a really nice waiter who delicately lays napkin on your knees before dinner.
Rooms are perfect as are the beds with good mattresses and wide selection of pillows.
If you are a guy - take your lady there because she really deserves it!",October 2015,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d193620-Reviews-The_Chelsea_Harbour_Hotel-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
It really was a nice stay,"It was a very nice hotel. Luxurious rooms with very good breakfast and dinner.
However I am always disappointed if I get a room facing all the other courtyard windows with minimal light and no glimpse of the sky.
I wonder why nobody informs you about this when you check in?
Also I am not so sure about the neighbourhood. Getting back to the hotel at night did not feel too safe. But it might be different when travelling with someone else.",November 2015,Polonia Palace Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274856-d276699-Reviews-Polonia_Palace_Hotel-Warsaw_Mazovia_Province_Central_Poland.html,"Warsaw, Poland",hotels,4.0,4.5
Quick stay,"This hotel is nice for a quick stay but I would probably not choose it for a luxurious getaway (or holiday).
It was not the cleanliest hotel I have ever been to, but overall the room was ok, breakfast continental and service almost as it should be.
When checking out they tried to charge us for rooms we already had payed for. I really do not appreciate these type of mix ups.",November 2015,Four Points by Sheraton Brussels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188644-d206698-Reviews-Four_Points_by_Sheraton_Brussels-Brussels.html,"Brussels, Belgium",hotels,3.0,4.0
Little things seem to matter,"I love when they put effort into little things. This is what makes one restaurant differ from all of the others.
I just loved the handwritten menu at a big chalk board that the waiter dragged around the restaurant. Although she had no idea how to translate this big French menu into English we really did not mind as everything we ordered was really good.",November 2015,Le Fruit Defendu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1136493-d1227030-Reviews-Le_Fruit_Defendu-Ixelles_Brussels.html,"Ixelles, Belgium",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Mix ups always make the memories bitter,"This is a very nice hotel.
My room was small with no view, but clean and met all the needs for 5 nights.
I really enjoyed every breakfast as I could eat it at the open terrace facing the water. Just lovely!
The only thing that put me down was how they handled mixup with the booking dates. When checking in they did not inform me that there was going to be an extra fee for the ""missed"" day. Also they did not inform me about it when cheking out. Instead I got a really angry letter from my boss months later asking why had I stayed a day longer, although I did not.",October 2015,Clarion Hotel Admiral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190502-d206359-Reviews-Clarion_Hotel_Admiral-Bergen_Hordaland_Western_Norway.html,"Bergen, Norway",hotels,4.0,4.0
I loved my room there!,"I loved my room at the Copenhagen Island Hotel! Finally a room with a fantastic view facing the canal and a window from the ground to high up. Light and clean room, comfortable bed and good WIFI.
Sleep was good, breakfast was very good and getting to the city centre and to the airport was not difficult by train.
Unfortunately getting to the conference centre was not very convenient.
The morning bus was too crowded, so at times it did not even stop at the designated station. Sometimes if it did, I found myself in the arms of a total stranger who desperately tried to find something to hold on to - not my dream of a perfect morning.
Despite this minor detail it was a lovely stay!",November 2015,Copenhagen Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189541-d583813-Reviews-Copenhagen_Island-Copenhagen_Zealand.html,"Copenhagen, Denmark",hotels,4.0,4.0
Luxurious stay in Prague,"Luxurious hotel with friendly and helpful staff, delicious meals, nice rooms and decent conference area.

I was not very exited that my room faced the gallery and therefore was quite dark and not very private. However as I only slept there I did not mind. If I was travelling for other reasons I would definitely ask for a room facing any other way.

I loved that I could walk downtown from the hotel and enjoy excellent views and fantastic architecture along the way. No fear of getting lost as the street downhill from the hotel takes you directly to the Charles bridge.

In case you want to shop, there are several jewellery shops in Prague that give really nice discounts if you are willing to pay cash.

The hotel staff recommended to be careful with random taxis and gave contacts of a trustworthy taxi company in case we needed it.",March 2016,Lindner Hotel Prague Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d1212533-Reviews-Lindner_Hotel_Prague_Castle-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,5.0,4.5
Perfect getaway,"If you are looking for a perfect getaway from frantic city life (or from your life) you'll find this place to be perfect.
Book the luxury suite, ask them to prepare ground cooked lamb for your dinner and just let go.

I just love this place!",July 2016,Luscher & Matiesen Muhu Veinitalu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608744-d6582827-Reviews-Luscher_Matiesen_Muhu_Veinitalu-Muhu_Saare_County.html,"Muhu, Estonia",hotels,5.0,4.0
Lovely B&B,"Lovely B&B just next to the beach with helpful and friendly staff and romantic atmosphere.

I loved staying there, however there are some things you should know before booking it.

If you have problems climbing stairs you should ask for a room on a lower level or decide to choose someplace else as stairs are steep and there is no elevator.

There lives a sleepy cat with good manners who greets you at the door every time you come home. I personally loved it but if you are allergic, probably not the first thing you wish to see at the reception door .",May 2016,Brighton House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186273-d561380-Reviews-Brighton_House-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html,"Brighton, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
Lovely location,"Good hotel just next to the beach with decent rooms and good breakfast.

I loved that I could jog along the beach anytime and enjoy the sporting facilities at the beach.
During some days there were naked middle aged men at the beach - not sure why. Luckily the sporting track runs higher.

The conference centre is just 5 minutes waking distance and the city centre is not that far away.

Overall good experience, however you should be aware of the pickpockets as they also steal bags from the reception area as it happened to one of us.

The scheme is that one guy drops papers in front of you and a lady steals your bag as you try to help the guy. So hold on to your bag even at the reception and leave your valuables at home.

I was recommended that in Barcelona it is sometimes worth to leave “do not disturb” sign on the door to avoid unnecessary cleaners (if you of course do not need the real one).",October 2015,Hotel Front Maritim,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d228621-Reviews-Hotel_Front_Maritim-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,4.0,3.5
