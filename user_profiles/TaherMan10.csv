A trip down history lane,"words can't really describe the place, the view from the top is amazing not to mention the well preserved ruins of the temple of Athina, if only have time to see one thing in athens this is your place
i recommend you buy the combined ticket worth 30 euros from any other place such as temple of Olympian Zeus to avoid the long lanes
it can be really hot during the day so watch the weather and don't forget you bottle of water",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
