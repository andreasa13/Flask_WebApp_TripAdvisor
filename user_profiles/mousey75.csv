absolutely wonderful but VERY strenuous and dangerous if you are NOT in good shape. Use a good experienced guide,absolutely wonderful but VERY strenuous and dangerous if you are NOT in good shape. Use a good experienced guide!! We used a local tour guide named Hugh and he was amazing....HIGHLY recommend his company. I cannot remember the company name right off. The cave is the MOST beautiful thing I have maybe ever seen and we travel a LOT.

don't stay on the weekend...wild crowd of locals and they party and knock on your door ALL night but weeknights are good,"We stayed 3 nights here....a Friday Saturday and Sunday....Friday was rowdy until around midnight because ALL the locals come that are not staying at the hotel and use the pool which is amazing and drink at the pool bar. Saturday night we were kept up ALL night long...people slammed doors, laughed loud, beat on chairs, and knocked on our door then ran probably 20 times every 10 minutes or so starting at about 1am. The property and room is very clean and nice and once again a beautiful pool with a waterfall and staff is nice but it is NOT a quiet nor family place on the weekend...lots of very sexual teens there also so not kid friendly for vacationers. We are a middle age couple traveling alone so ignored it. I would say absolutely under NO circumstances stay on a Saturday night but the other nights were better.",April 2021,Midas Belize,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g291971-d550394-Reviews-Midas_Belize-San_Ignacio_Cayo.html,"San Ignacio, Belize",hotels,4.0,4.0
rude about check out and noisy....bathroom exhaust vent FILTHY!!!!!,We have stayed here many many times and always loved it...however this time felt different....maybe covid maybe not?? The exhaust vent in the bathroom was hanging with dirt and debris and absolutely filthy...carpet was dirty. Maybe cleaning LESS due to covid JUST don't KNOW?? Also we was called at 10:40 by housekeeping and asked why we had not left...I said check out isn't 11 and the lady said no it is 10am. I said okay sorry we didn't even check in Wed night until almost 8pm and she said it didn't matter. I said do you want us out this minute and she said yes leave right now...just super rude and my daughter and her husband are property owners....can't wait to tell them about this. Maybe they can get out of their time share due to the property going downhill and the staff being extra hateful and rude.....no sense in this.,December 2020,The Wilderness Club at Big Cedar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g44844-d281605-Reviews-The_Wilderness_Club_at_Big_Cedar-Ridgedale_Missouri.html,"Ridgedale, Missouri",hotels,3.0,4.5

Just absolutely wonderful!!!,"My husband had a total hip replacement 10/26/20 at mercy orthopedic hospital in Ft Smith, AR and we live 2 hours away. I needed a place to lay down, sleep for the night, shower, and rest once his surgery was over. The hotel staff went above and beyond to make me feel welcome, secure, check in early to rest, and was even willing to give me a late check out (which I ended up not needing). This hotel is perfectly located, super quiet and safe, comfy beds, extra clean, and breakfast was really good with the corona restrictions going on.

Do NOT stay here in DECEMBER EVER!!!! Nightmare stuff and the rudest I have ever met in my LIFE,Do NOT stay here in DECEMBER EVER!!!! Nightmare stuff and the rudest I have ever met in my LIFE!!!! OMG we stayed here 1 night Dec 14th 2019 and had a show at 3pm. We needed to check in about 1pm so called at noon and nobody was even there so we left a voicemail that was not returned no call back. Showed up at 1:15pm and again nobody there but the adjoining restaurant was open....called again and the phone rang behind the counter and rang bell and nothing....restaurant guy said the lady was upstairs and would come down...he finally called her and she was furious we were there. She said she doesn't mess with ozark deals and wasn't messing with me and was screaming at me. NEVER experienced anything like it and come to find out they had CLOSED DECEMBER 5th???? They had sold us a voucher so decided eh we can stay when they say we can so we checked in at 10pm after a show and slept....stained carpet and brown towels mixed with some white wash cloths...towels use to be white but was so grungy and unbleached they should have been thrown away.

Loved everything about it but the neighbors above us....no sound barrier and very loud!,The owners are wonderful and so is this property but for $176 I really expected quiet and rest which we did NOT get. We were in the hummingbird suite and had people staying above us (Valentine's day weekend so they were full) and they came in about 11:30pm and woke us up...we laughed super loud and they got quiet. They was up about 6am the next morning walking around but obvious they were trying to be quiet you just can't at a 100 year old property with no insulation for sound proofing so my advice is stay here the breakfast and people are amazing but stay in a lower price above unit. Hope this helps many!!!,February 2019,5 Ojo Inn Bed and Breakfast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g31582-d72823-Reviews-5_Ojo_Inn_Bed_and_Breakfast-Eureka_Springs_Arkansas.html,"Eureka Springs, Arkansas",hotels,4.0,5.0
"nice and clean...super friendly staff but no rest due to guest above stomping around, running water. Right on interstate","This hotel has a delicious breakfast included, friendly staff, clean big rooms, BUT it is right ON the interstate so lots of traffic noise and in the night I heard a train??? Also I was in a ground level room and the people above me kept me up past midnight and had me back up at 7am...wasn't many people staying there so WHY they put someone ABOVE me instead of a room or 2 down from me is silly and not using good sense. I would stay again but only on the top floor (2 levels)",January 2019,Best Western Trail Dust Inn & Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g56726-d73194-Reviews-Best_Western_Trail_Dust_Inn_Suites-Sulphur_Springs_Texas.html,"Sulphur Springs, Texas",hotels,4.0,4.0
Shannon was the nicest most helpful taco bell worker ever and food was delicious,"I ate here 1-18-19 on a biz trip and there was an older lady wiping tables, visiting with guests, Shannon was kind to her employees (she's the mgr) and they were all working so great as a team. The food was fast, very fresh, and other people eating there were happy, friendly, visiting, and content with their food also...a GREAT taco bell location for sure!",January 2019,Long John Silvers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56726-d3853665-Reviews-Long_John_Silvers-Sulphur_Springs_Texas.html,"Sulphur Springs, Texas",restaurants,5.0,2.5

Wonderful 1 bedroom with a bath and a half and a HUGE jacuzzi tub,Stayed here 5 days and it was just wonderful...great staff. Even greater property and it has a 3 person (not kidding) jacuzzi in the bedroom in the 600 sq ft 1 bedroom and another bathroom with a walk in shower and a half bath in the bedroom..small living room with dining table and small kitchen but full size stove and everything you need.

LOVE this property....never disappointed with the condo or the service they provide,"I stay here fairly often in a 1 bedroom and it is HUGE and wonderful. Every single employee is beyond helpful, kind, and want you to enjoy your stay. It is highly recommended and you have a 2 person jacuzzi right in your bedroom and a full kitchen so I cook most of our meals and save a fortune not eating out.",November 2018,The Falls Village Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g44160-d96584-Reviews-The_Falls_Village_Resort-Branson_Missouri.html,"Branson, Missouri",hotels,5.0,4.0
