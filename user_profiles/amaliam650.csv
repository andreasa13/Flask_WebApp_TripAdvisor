Excellent staying,"I would start with the staff, which is so hardworking, friendly and polite. Due to the issues created by Covid 19 we had to cancel and book again our staying at Novotel, and the support and patience we got from the staff was excellent.
We arrived by train from Thessaloniki, and being just 9 minutes walk from the train station to the hotel we decided to walk, it is conveniently situated, so the taxi ride to the city centre won't be more than 7e and to the Acropolis maybe 10e.
Again due to Covid 19 I won't recommend breakfast as you'll get just coffee, croissants, yogurt and boiled eggs, so in my opinion 12e per person is a bit much.
The room is great, nice and spacious with deep foam mattresse very comfortable.
We enjoyed some drinks at the pool bar where we got nice view on daytime and night time as well.
We chose 2nd time Novotel, 1st one was in Bucharest, and we weren't disappointed.",July 2020,Novotel Athenes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d206776-Reviews-Novotel_Athenes-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Lovely shop,"Very nice and posh looking Shop on Plaka street in Athens.
I would say that it is the best place where you can buy jewelry for good prices (5 to 20e per piece)
They are natural handmade products, looking unique and stylish.
The staff is very friendly, well trained and helpful. They convinced even my husband to purchase a lava stone beads bracelet...and he is hard to convince.
I am sorry I didn't buy more items.
They have many shops in many Greek islands and inland so if you walk by a store worth a visit, you won't be disappointed.",July 2020,Athens Protasis Jewellery shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2693719-Reviews-Athens_Protasis_Jewellery_shop-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
Neighborhood of the Gods,"Plaka is one of the most popular places in Athens. Nice small shops, restaurants and nice view of the Acropolis.

Good but not enough,"Found this place by accident. Went there for lunch just after visiting around.
You will find local food, nice but not the best.
The waiters were a bit nervous so that made the staying a bit uncomfortable.
Definitely it is not the best place where to taste traditional food.",July 2020,Savas from Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1890605-Reviews-Savas_from_Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Greek food,"We came here in the first night just after we left our luggages at the hotel, just 9 minutes walk from Novotel.
We were pleasantly surprised by the rustic decor and the nice and relaxing music.
The food was excellent, came very fast and in generous portions.
At the end we got from the house an amazing panacotta.
I definitely recommend it if your are looking for Greek food in great atmosphere.",July 2020,MIRONI Greek Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14072280-Reviews-MIRONI_Greek_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing views,"Amazing views
Enjoyed a 3 nights stay at alia palace
It is definitely an awesome experience to have your own private pool and two nice infinity pools where you can take great Instagram photos.
We've just had breakfast included. Not a 5stars breakfast but good enough.
If you want you cand enjoy some nights by the infinity pool and have a nice dinner at a very good price, or you will get precious information from the staff about the best places nearby. So, dear Ioanna, thank you for your welcoming and your recommendations, we've followed your list and never got disappointed.
I would work on the room services though. you don't have the possibility to enjoy too many things as you don't have a menu in the room, and your fridge contains just still and mineral water... and also if you want breakfast in the room you have to pay in full for it ....and no list of what you can choose...",July 2020,Alia Palace Luxury Hotel and Villas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g670101-d278872-Reviews-Alia_Palace_Luxury_Hotel_and_Villas-Pefkohori_Kassandra_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedo.html,"Pefkohori, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
