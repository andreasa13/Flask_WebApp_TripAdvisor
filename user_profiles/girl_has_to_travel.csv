How they even got the star??,"I don’t understand how this restaurant can have a Michelin star, because it’s a joke, not a high class establishment. We came here on our Christmas trip in Vienna, as we were staying at SO Sofitel and opted for the special Christmas menu with wine pairing (the bill came approx 550 eur for two people). Well, these were the most stupidly spent 500 eur! Yes, the view is amazing and the ceiling decor is very impressive, but that’s it for the good things. The food was average, main fish dish was very over salted, other dishes were ok, but nothing close to innovative. The service was chaotic, messed up and left the strong impression that all those young waiters just don’t have a clue what they are doing. Some dishes came rushed, for some we needed to wait too long, they didn’t follow the pattern of our eating speed and just brought out whatever the kitchen gave to them. At the end our waiter literally killed us when he brought us the bill before the dessert and asked us to pay because “he ends his shift”. He then came back after 5 min, standing there and asking for money to be payed immediately. As customers we don’t care for his shifts, the bill should be brought at the end of the meal and this kind of service is not appropriate in any restaurant, not even speaking of a high class one. Speaking of dessert , I guess that for 550 eur the Michelin star restaurant could at least offer a coffee with it. Instead, our waiter informed us that it is not included. He could bring us a coffee to excuse himself for the rushed bill, but I guess it didn’t come to his mind. It is very nice that the restaurant manager so eagerly replies on each comment, but he could instead go “above and beyond” to finally train his staff, otherwise this restaurant is a true shame on Michelin guide, despite all its potential.",December 2019,Das Loft,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190454-d1986369-Reviews-Das_Loft-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Absolutely the best ribs in Vienna!,"We come here almost every time we visit Vienna! Their ribs are really the best in Vienna, you can get both the traditional and flavoured ones. My favourite is Orange ribs with orange and plum sauce, but you can opt for mixed trio and then you can choose three different ribs to try. From the starters fried mozzarella is worth to try. The prices are more than affordable, the service is friendly. Recommended to book, as the place is usually full.

Our favourite restaurant in Vienna!,"Fabios is our favourite restaurant in Vienna! It’s very chic and classy, with wonderful service and amazing food, I think you can’t get wrong here with any choice from the menu. We especially like the beef carpaccio, tuna tartar, eggplant starter and monkfish with prosciutto. They also make good cocktails and have a separate bar area if you want to pass by just for drinks.

Yummy grilled fish platter,"This restaurant was a very pleasant surprise! I wasn’t sure what to expect, based on controversial reviews but as I wanted to go to fish restaurant, we decided to give it a try. And I am glad we did! We took the grilled fish platter, big enough for 4 people (so be careful and don’t over order the starters!) with truffle mashed potatoes and spinach, oysters and tuna starter in some amazing sauce. All the food was superb! The waiter advised us a nice Riesling to pair with the food. The location on the market can be a bit confusing, but the restaurant’s setting is nice and the quality of food is worth the trip here.",February 2020,Nautilus Fischrestaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190454-d1816688-Reviews-Nautilus_Fischrestaurant-Vienna.html,"Vienna, Austria",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Best Shoreditch tour with Henri,"If you want to do an alternative tour in London, make sure you do one of these ones! I chose Shoreditch tour with Henri and it blew my mind away. I love walking tours and do them all around the world, but it’s really rare to see such engaging, knowledgeable, fun and easy going guide as Henri! He has a great understanding of the history of the area and art movement, which emerged here. Despite rain and cold, we had the most pleasant two hours and time flew too fast! Henri is a great guy and he shared also stories about him and his experience as a homeless person and that changed my perspective of the subject quite a lot. I will definitely go on other tours with this company and strongly advise you to do the same! It’s not only participating in a good cause, supporting a social enterprise, but also getting high quality tour because believe me, these guides are brilliant.

Really the best on Brick lane!,"The best experience in this London trip! I came here after a Shoreditch tour on rainy afternoon, literally shaking with cold and very hungry and was greeted by the warmest way possible! I felt like I was visiting friends, not just looking for place to eat and warm up. Oh and speaking about eating - all the food was great! I had papadam and cheese Naan and Chicken masala for the main, which is my favourite dish. Also make sure to try spicy tea - just on spot after walking in the cold. I will definitely be back to try some more food and I strongly advise you to give The Monsoon the try!

Night out with friends,"Very cool and stylish place with nice vibe. We started with the drinks by the bar (by the way, cocktails are seriously good here), following by dinner and then some dancing at the bar area. The place was packed, lots of fun and the food was good as well. I give 4 stars instead of 5 only because of too loud music which made it difficult to communicate during dinner. Otherwise, if you are with friends and want to have a night out, this is a great choice!",December 2019,COYA Dubai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d7285081-Reviews-COYA_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Nice vibe and great food,"We loved our evening at Zuma! It has a cool vibe, the place was quite full but not too crowded and the bar area is great for pre dinner drinks. Nice music and not too loud so you can easily speak with your partner. We prefer to sit upstairs as it’s more informal. The food was great as usual, we particularly enjoyed soft shell crab, Chilean sea bass and black cod.

Very special and authentic hotel,"Amazing hotel in the middle of historical district of Sultanahmet! Once you walk inside, you feel like stepping into oriental palace. The hotel’s decoration is truly beautiful, with silk carpets and tapestry, handmade ornate furniture with mother of pearl incrustations, hand painted tiles, marble bathrooms, artworks of Turkish artists. Service was warm and welcoming from the moment we arrived. The hotel offers free shuttle service to major sights, but the location also allows you to walk to Grand Bazaar and Aya Sofia area. Breakfast restaurant offers great views over the marina and is a stunning place for your morning cappuccino. You need to note that no alcohol is served at this hotel and gym and spa has separate visiting times for men and women. But you can book the whole spa area for private use for 2 hours from 22.00 to 24.00 and it’s a wonderful experience which you can share with your loved one.

Oldest shisha place in Istanbul,"This amazing place near the Grand Bazaar is the oldest shisha place in Istanbul and I would recommend you to visit it if you want to have a different and authenic experience. They make really good shishas with smooth smoke and the guy is carrying around the tray with Turkish teas (apple is my favourite)...

Beautiful restaurant in Sultanahmet,"We ate dinner here once while staying at the Ajwa hotel. Didnt't know what to expect, but were very pleasantly surprised at the end! Restaurant is very beautiful and opulent, with magnificent view, so come before the sunset to be able to enjoy it! The service is outstanding - very friendly, but proffessional. And the food is top! Try the Azerbaijani plov - it's really good, nicely served and the portion is big enough to serve 3-4 people. And make sure to find your favourite sherbet from their selection (it will be hard as they all are good). If you want calm, romantic meal in beautiful surroundings, this is a good choice in Sultanahmet district.",November 2019,Zeferan Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d12243231-Reviews-Zeferan_Restaurant-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Stylish place for a evening out,"Maybe we were just lucky but we had a perfect evening at Zuma! It's a very stylish place with good music and nice ambiance. The food was great, the service was attentive, but not overwhelming. The only negative point was that this location is quite far from the historical part of Istanbul where we were staying, but in such big city as Istanbul you can't expect to have everything in walking distance.

Must see in Athens and actually very enjoyable visit,"Acropolis is the must see atraction in Athens and it is totally worth it! Maybe I was lucky, but I didn't have any problems with the queues or crowds. I bought my ticket on the site, waited in line maybe 10 min max and then got in without any lines at all. It was crowded up there, but not too dramatic. Of course, things will be very different in season. I also did find the climb up the hill to be very easy for a reasonably fit person. The site itself is very impessive, but I would take a guide if I can suggest, because there is not much of explanations and the ones which are present, are quite limited and cover mostly the architectural part of the monuments, but won't tell you much about the mythology side. As for me, the mythology is equally, if not even more exciting. :) Don't just go straight up the hill and away, walk also around it as there you will see even more interesting sights. And make sure to visit the Acropolis museum - it's a separate ticket, but it will help you to understand, what you see. And it's not a big exibition, so it won't take much of your time.

Beautiful Belle Epogue Villa,"This beautiful villa looks like pink jewellery box inside lush green gardens. Gardens are nice to stroll around and provide stunning views of the coast, go on clear sunny day to take a lot of good pictures! The gardens are interestingly laid out and very lush, but they are not too manicured... you can sense a bit of wilderness feeling. Someone commented that gardens are not well looked after, but to me the natural look actually added to the appeal.

Great quality seafood in Nice,"I would give 5 stars for the food and 3 stars for the service and ambiance - it sums up to 4 stars in total. The food is great, if you like cold seafood of course. We took the platter with oysters, big prawns, langustines and crab legs, all was good and fresh. The service was quite rushed, but overall ok for such place - it's not a restaurant and they are interested in turning tables quickly. The ambiance is busy and noisy bistro atmosphere.

Nice restaurant with room for improvement,"Good quality products, but the seasoning and presentation of the food could be improved. For example, my octopus carpaccio was soaking in olive oil - I don't think that carpaccio should look like a soup. It was delicious, though. Oysters were served just with one piece of lemon - from the seafood restaurant I would expect also some vinegar added. Fries were also served plain, no sauces, not even mayo. The cod and prawns were good. Service need to be improved. We waited a long time to be seated, staff was passing by, not even paying attention to us standing by the door. Actually it is a typical problem for Polish restaurants, as I understood. Once seated, they mixed up our order. Our waiter was really upset and fixed it quickly, so we can't blaim him. But these are the small things, which distinguish a good restaurant from the great one.

Yummy food in the heart of Old town,"The food was great, we had jumbo combo and their special fries. Coctails were very average, so better stick with the beer.

The best WWII museum so far,"This is the absolute must see when visiting Gdansk and so far it's the best WWII museum that I have visited. It's huge, you'll need good 4 hours here, but for us it wasn't tiring and time flew so fast. You can buy ticket online (recommended to go in at 14.00 as the latest so you have 4 h till closing time) and take the audioguide at the museum. Exibition shows WWII with emphasis on Poland and Eastern front, but it's not limited only to that. It consists of actual war time artefacts and also lots of audiovisual material, which makes learning easier. I would definitely take here children, who learn about WWII in school. One visit here can seriously improve their understanding about the subject. And I would also recommend every adult to visit the museum.

Loved the small size of the group and possibility to chat with captain and other passengers. At the end of the tour our group even went for dinner together, which was an amazing ending of evening, thanks TDBG for that! You can bring your own drinks to the boat (which is cool) and it's allowed to smoke. It's not a problem for non-smokers, as smoking seats are in the back (I personally didn't smell anything). We loved to see the part of A-dam, where big boats don't visit, as well as most beautiful main canals. The only thing which could be better - our captain was super friendly and he answered our questions, but he didn't give us much info about the city by his own initiative. We were not expecting a traditional tour, but would love to hear more informal info, tips and curious facts about the city.

The garden itself is very beautiful and even the crowds couldn't spoil the experience. Just be prepared that it won't be a relaxing stroll. The garden is not that big and I don't think it's needed to stay all day in Keukenhof, you can better rent bicycles outside the park entrance and ride to the tulip fields.

Streetfood madness,"I love foodhalls, so I was eager to visit this one. One of the reasons to visit it on that particular day were long working hours, stated in this listing. The hall is pretty nice and has big variety of food, but unfortunately we didn't had an oportunity to try it all. Although it states to be opened till 1 AM on Fri, Sat, lots of food stalls were already closed or closing down at 22.00 when we arrived. Apparently only the bar stays open so late.

Ride like a local,"Great bike rental service! Big amount of different type bikes, they come with chain and key, so easy to park. Service was good and we could book our bikes on their webpage and pick them up at our selected location. Bikes can be returned to any of their service points and also repair service is available, if needed. We really enjoyed this experience and could explore the further parts of Amsterdam, which would be hard to do on foot.",April 2019,Amsterdam Black-Bikes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d4996074-Reviews-Amsterdam_Black_Bikes-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.0
Did you know that you can eat your breakfast without Instagramming it?,"Actually this quote is written on their napkin holders and it is so true because it's one of the most Instagrammable cafes in Amsterdam! The food presentation will make you want to grab your camera. And it tastes as good as it looks! The whole place is very cute and cosy. I would advise you to book a table (via their webpage) and to bring your card because they don't take cash. It was not cheap, but I would go back in a heartbeat!",April 2019,Corner Bakery - Amsterdam Oud Zuid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188590-d6634960-Reviews-Corner_Bakery_Amsterdam_Oud_Zuid-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Cute breakfast spot,"Cute, popular breakfast place. It was full when we visited, so had to wait around 10 min to be seated, which is ok. Unfortunately then we waited another 40 min for our food to arrive. We were not in a hurry, but apparently it's not a place for a quick bite. When the food arrived, it was fine, coffee was also good. Overall, I would visit again if I stayed nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here.",April 2019,The Breakfast Club,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188590-d7346923-Reviews-The_Breakfast_Club-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",restaurants,4.0,3.5
A must do for all art lovers,"I loved this museum! Van Gogh is one of my favourite painters and seeing so many of his works in one place was a real treat. Don't miss taking the audioguide, it's excellent and provides a deeper understanding about Van Gogh's life and work. I would say that you should plan 2 hours for the museum itself and then some more time for the Hockney exibition. Tickets can be bought online for spwcific time slot. We visited Amsterdam at Easter holidays and booked tickets 2 weeks ahead, and there were only a couple of time slots left, so better buy the tickets well in advance.",April 2019,Van Gogh Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d190554-Reviews-Van_Gogh_Museum-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great tour with Ricardo,"I love free walking tours and find them to have much more value than regular tours. This time we had a walk with Ricardo and really enjoyed the tour. I think it was one of the best we ever had! Ricardo is fantastic guide, very fun and knowledgeable, with passion for what he does. We learned a lot about the city and it gave our trip a whole new meaning. It's always a lot more fun if you know and understand the country which you are visiting. We loved that Ricardo explained us not only the historical facts, but also the culture and spirit of Amsterdam and Netherlands, including the ""would like to know, but too shy to ask"" questions about Red lights and (not so) legal weed. Thank you, Ricardo!",April 2019,FreeDam Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188590-d10038783-Reviews-FreeDam_Tours-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",attractions,5.0,5.0
Great choice for seafood lovers,"I have heard about The Seafood bar long before we booked our trip to Amsterdam, so I was eager to give it a try. Reservation can be easily made by webpage, you can also get a table without it, but be prepared to wait. The food was fantastic, we shared the oysters and mixed cold and hot seafood plateau, so it was plenty of choice. All was fresh and delicious! They have good French cremant, which is perfect, if you want some bubbles with your oysters. Service is professional and friendly and restaurant was full when we visited. Yes, maybe not a place for romantic candellight dinner, but that's why it's called a bar! All is good here and I would strongly recomend this restaurant for all seafood lovers!",April 2019,The Seafood Bar van Baerlestraat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188590-d3323106-Reviews-The_Seafood_Bar_van_Baerlestraat-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Perfect addition to Riga's dining scene,"Riga has deserved it for a long time and finally it's here - the foodcourt in Central market is opened! Riga's central market is one of the biggest and oldest in Europe. And yes, the foodcourt perfectly fits in central market scene - the same you can see in Barcelona, Lisbon, Berlin, Amsterdam and now also in Riga! Food is very good, here you will find everything, starting from traditional street food to seafood, sushi, grill, yummy bowls, vegetarian options, crepes and waffles. In center is a big bar which also makes delicious coctails if you want something more than just a beer. The atmosphere is vibrant and cheerful and the service was very friendly. I will definitely come back and I can highly recommend Centralais food court to all residents and visitors of Riga!",February 2019,Centralais Gastro Tirgus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274967-d15813347-Reviews-Centralais_Gastro_Tirgus-Riga_Riga_Region.html,"Riga, Latvia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Amazing day with Etna 3000 trip,"We had a amazing day on Etna with Fabrizio! Going up the vulcano with the guide is completely different experience than doing it alone. We were shown and told so many things about the vulcano and Sicily, it gave us a much deeper understanding and excitement about what we saw. We went up to 3000 m, saw different craters, went into the lava tube, had the chance to run on vulcanic sand. Delicious home made lunch was a very nice touch! Fabrizio was a great guide and we enjoyed every minute of the trip.

The right choice for perfect dinner,"We had a lovely dinner at Caviar & Bull. We booked the table on terrace and had a nice view over the bay. The food was delicious, we had Contemprorary tasting menu, which had a nice balance between fish and meat dishes. Beef carpaccio was particulary good!

Every corner is picture-perfectq,"A maze of romantic narrow streets, full of local character and charm. A real delight to stroll around in day or evening. I wanted to take picture of every single street, every corner! Lots of restaurants and bars for dinner or drinks, lots of shopping options. Nearby is private lido and a wooden platform where you can take a swim or just see the sunset from the rocks.

Coctails in romantic countryard,"Lovely place for evening drinks in Ortigia! First, the setting is very romantic - in a beautiful countyard, tables are lit with candles, the ambience is stylish and relaxed. Coctails are of best quality, creative and unusual, lots of them were invented by the barmen. About the taste I will say honestly - some we liked more, some less. But it's a subject of individual taste. Service is nice and attentive, but a bit slow.

Fresh fish and seafood,"Perfect place for fish and seafood lovers! We shared selection of different dishes - fried fish mix, caponata, octopus salad, potatos, calamari, all was cooked to perfection! They serve also fresh caught of the day, cooked to your liking. Just ask, what fish do they have! Also very delicious cannoli, which are made in house.

Relaxing day by the pool,"We spent a nice day by the pool at Cafe del Mar. In my opinion, the best sunbeds are Vip beds by the pool, yes, it's pricey, but if your budget allows, go for it. 20 € sunbeds are uncomfortable and placed by the small pool (good only if your are with kids) and 25 € beds are better but still quite small and all squeezed together. You can rent towels for 5 €, ask the staff. Convenient shower facilities. The pool is fantastic, only I wish it was deeper (it's 1.25 with deeper water at one end). Service was professional and attentive, coctails were very good. Music could be little more quiet. For lunch we took the sushi which were ok and pizza with seefood which was much better than I expected!

Boat was clean and in excellent technical condition, the staff gave us explicit instructions how to drive it and how to use navigation, which places to avoid (reefs, shallow waters), very professional service!

Perfectly cooked rabbit,"This small, unpretendious restaurant serves great traditional food! Trip Adviser states that it opens only for dinner, which is not true, you can go also for lunch. Restaurant has a couple of tables inside and couple on small terrace, so it's better to book. We had fried octopus and snails for starter and rabbit in wine gravy for mains. Everything was cooked to perfection! Local red wine went good with the rabbit. Service was friendly, we didn't have to wait long for our food.

Warm welcome and delicious meal,"We had a lovely dinner at Ta' Victor! We were lucky to get a table in last minute, but I would suggest to book ahead because several visitors were declined because they had no reservation. On arrival we were greeted by Victor, the owner. The dinner is in form of set menu, where you get a maltese platter for starter, traditional fish broth, a choice of fish or meat for mains and a dessert, which was yummy ice cream with cinnanon pastry. The food was divine! We had red snapper for mains, but I saw that the table next to us ordered steaks and they looked very good as well. All fish is fresh and locally caught, what comes from the sea in morning, gets served in the evening. All in all, we had very pleasant night and felt very welcomed.
