Fantastic atmosphere,"There are several reasons to visit this place. It gives closer details of things most visitors most probably have seen at the Acropolis. The explanation and recommendations of the ornaments of the Parthenon are especially impressive. The opening hours are long and there is a library as well, so it is a perfect spot to take in the atmosphere of Greek history.",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Tomb of Alexander's father,"This archeological site probably gives the visitor the best idea in Greece what life looked like in the time of Alexander the Great. The fact that the place was so recently discovered (80s) and so intact makes it even more alluring. I highly recommend visiting this place. However the public communications to this place are not good, and that took away a bit of the overall impression.",January 2020,Museum of the Royal Tombs of Aigai (Vergina),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1082258-d2459889-Reviews-Museum_of_the_Royal_Tombs_of_Aigai_Vergina-Vergina_Imathia_Region_Central_Macedo.html,"Vergina, Greece",attractions,4.0,5.0
