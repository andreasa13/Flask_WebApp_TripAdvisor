Monasteries of Meteora,"We took a 4 hour train ride from Athens to Kambala then boarded a tour bus to see 3 monasteries in the mountains above the town.

It was a sight to see old Greek monasteries built high on cliffs. We paid 3 euro per adult per monastery.

Wear good walking shoes as there are many steps to walk. This place is not handicap accessible.",January 2020,Meteora,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1070999-d523805-Reviews-Meteora-Kastraki_Kalambaka_Trikala_Region_Thessaly.html,"Kastraki, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Disappointing,"We walked to the Museum of Illusions from our hotel which was 1/2 mile and took us about 15 min to arrive. It is easy to miss as all the buildings here blend in together.

We paid 9 euro (10 usd) per adult. Go early in the morning when it is not so busy.

We were disappointed since many of the illusions we have seen and can be found on line.",January 2020,Athens Museum of Illusions Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d17553562-Athens_Museum_of_Illusions_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,3.0,4.5
More history on Greek,"More displays on Greek history. A lot of busts and statues of prominent Greeks.
Price was 6 euro (6.70 usd) per adult.

We walked from our hotel to the museum (approx 1 mile) which took us about 25 min to do.",January 2020,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great experience on Greek history.,"A great experience to see pieces of Greek history on display.
Sundays are free admission for all. Normal ticket prices start at 7 euro (7.81 usd) per adult.
Go early in the day as it gets crowded by noon.",January 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Acropolis,"We visited the Acropolis on a Sunday which we found out is free admission on this day.

We walked to the Acropolis from our room with the help of google maps, which took us about 20-25 minutes. Being comfortable walking shoes if you plan to walk around the area.

I suggest to visit the Acropolis early in the day when it is less crowded. When we were just about touring the place many people were there which was around noon. The normal price of admission is 20 euro (22+ usd depending on rate) per adult.

Simply amazing how this historic place has survived the times. There is continuous restoration going on.",January 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great place to stay,"We were originally booked at Wyndham Residence across the street from Wyndham Grand. Due to remodeling at Residence we were accommodated at Grand at no additional charge.

Nice room with a king size bed. No tub only shower. Shower floor is flat allowing water to leak on the bathroom floor if glass door isn’t closed completely.

Room had nice amenities like in room safe, mini bar, robes and a coffee maker that uses mini k-cups. Property will give first two k-cups for free on arrival then will charge 1.50 euro for each after. We did a lot of walking and found mini Marts around the property where we picked up instant coffee. We didn’t find the exact k-cup size as used in the room.

Restaurant is on the 9th floor with beautiful views of the city including an excellent shot of the Acropolis.

So far we are very pleased and comfortable here.",January 2020,Wyndham Grand Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d10961869-Reviews-Wyndham_Grand_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
Two nights,"For a weekend it was quiet, bathroom was extremely small and in this day and age of electronic gadgets the lack of outlets made it difficult to charge multiple devices.",April 2017,Howard Johnson by Wyndham Flagstaff I-40 East Lucky Lane,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60971-d73399-Reviews-Howard_Johnson_by_Wyndham_Flagstaff_I_40_East_Lucky_Lane-Flagstaff_Arizona.html,"Flagstaff, Arizona",hotels,3.0,3.0
January 2017,"The room and bathroom were spacious to move around, there was a mini fridge, microwave and a 1-cup coffee maker.

The tv was small for the room size as watching it from the bed was not too enjoyable. The bathroom may have had an LED that was low powered putting out low lighting. The carpet appeared to be dirty/stained and probably could use a shampoo cleaning.
Daily we had to have the room key exchanged at the front desk as it kept deactivating. The front desk was helpful and understanding in helping us.

Overall we were satisfied with the property and would stay here again.",January 2017,Super 8 by Wyndham Durango,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g33397-d85085-Reviews-Super_8_by_Wyndham_Durango-Durango_Colorado.html,"Durango, Colorado",hotels,3.0,3.5
One night,"Overpriced at 97.00 for one night, 2 full size beds.

Pros: Friendly front desk staff, full size refrigerator with freezer, small microwave and 2 burner electric stove. Definitely geared to long term lodging. Felt safe in the property though. Bedding and towels appeared clean and fresh.

Cons: Room could use updating like replacing the counter top (picture attached), a quieter bathroom fan and working lamps.

This property was the least expensive at the time of booking and I wish I paid more for a cleaner place.",January 2017,Extended Stay America - Phoenix - Airport - E.

Great food,"Great food but on the high end for 4.
Usual HRC with music memorabilia and it was not very busy at all.
Excellent customer service, food was prepared exactly as requested and it was filling.
One of the many HRC places on my bucket list to visit.",January 2017,Hard Rock Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g31310-d496222-Reviews-Hard_Rock_Cafe-Phoenix_Arizona.html,"Phoenix, Arizona",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Passing through Flagstaff Dec 2015,"We stayed at this 2 level motel, on the second floor.

Positives:
Spacious rooms-2 queen beds.
Microwave
Refrigerator
Complimentary Continental breakfast
4-cup coffee maker
working bathroom fan!

Opportunities for Improvement (OFI):
more outlets in the room-feed our technological power hungry toys.

Overall a nice place to stay for a night. Property has no elevator to the second level.
Older property has a forced air heat-a/c unit with manual controls (which is noisy as well). I had to get up in the middle of the night to turn it off as it was noisy and room became too warm.",December 2015,Howard Johnson by Wyndham Flagstaff I-40 East Lucky Lane,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60971-d73399-Reviews-Howard_Johnson_by_Wyndham_Flagstaff_I_40_East_Lucky_Lane-Flagstaff_Arizona.html,"Flagstaff, Arizona",hotels,3.0,3.0
Passing through; return flight home.,"Nice property located in Phoenix near Sky Harbor Airport. Property provides complimentary shuttle service to/from the airport. Spacious suites with refrigerator, microwave and a tv in the bedroom and sitting area. Outdoor pool was open in December!
Restaurant on premises along with several computers in the lobby with printers for your airline check-in or business needs.

The bedding was decent however seemed a bit dated as when I moved the whole bed moved (best I can describe is similar to a water bed). The pillows were small and too soft for my comfort so I suggest asking for additional pillows if you prefer.

Our bathroom did not have a fan so taking a hot shower or..accomplishing mission #2 did waft throughout the suite, plan your missions accordingly or use some type of air fresher. Bathrooms appeared a bit dated, with so much moisture not being able to vent the wall paper was peeling at the seams and the ceiling paint appeared bubbled. I didn't see any signs of mold however I'm sure some was present.

Plenty of lamps in the suite made for adequate lighting, and a plus is having a door separate the bedroom from the living area.

I would definitely stay here again.",December 2015,DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Phoenix,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g31310-d115482-Reviews-DoubleTree_Suites_by_Hilton_Hotel_Phoenix-Phoenix_Arizona.html,"Phoenix, Arizona",hotels,4.0,4.0

Very friendly hotel staff.
Filling continental breakfast. (Debby who made sure food and most importantly coffee was always stocked. She was awesome !
Great and accommodating housekeeping staff.

Opportunities for improvement (OFI's):
Larger coffee maker-single cup maker only.
Rooms were a bit small-cramped.

Very crowded!,"We took the bus from waikiki near the entrance which entailed a lot of walking.
Wear comfortable walking shoes and bring water.
It's costs 1.00 per person walking ( there is a charge for vehicles but I don't recall how much). Be prepared for a lot of people on the path.
Once you hit the very top on a clear day you'll be able to take some awesome pictures.",June 2014,‪Diamond Head State Monument,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60982-d107673-Reviews-Diamond_Head_State_Monument-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",attractions,3.0,4.5
