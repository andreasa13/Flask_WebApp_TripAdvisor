Bit of history,I'm Irish not American but nonetheless I still found this an interesting place and a nice little escape from craziness of old city. Who knew Morocco was first country to recognise the then fledgling United states of America?,October 2019,American Legation,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293737-d481062-Reviews-American_Legation-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima.html,"Tangier, Morocco",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice hostel,"Lovely hostel set in the old city. It cost me a bit more than some of the other places I stayed at in Morocco but to be fair it was also probably nicer. My room had 2 showers, there is a ton of seating areas and a rooftop area with great views and a few hammocks; it is also where you find free breakfast each morning which is lovely and all you can eat. I had a late flight and they allowed me to stay in hostel until 7/8pm free of charge.
1 complaint is WiFi, they have 1 router on 2nd floor and it didn't reach my bed on ground floor or rooftop. They really should have a router on each floor. I'm sure it wouldn't cost much more to do it.",October 2019,Bayt Alice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293737-d4891151-Reviews-Bayt_Alice-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima.html,"Tangier, Morocco",hotels,5.0,4.5
Sunset spot,This is a lovely 30-45 minute hike from old city that also acts as the sunset viewing spot so be prepared there will be dozens of other people there at that time as well but it is still worth it as the views are fantastic.,October 2019,Spanish Mosque,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304013-d13436579-Reviews-Spanish_Mosque-Chefchaouen_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima.html,"Chefchaouen, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.5
Photogenic,Tiny but oh so photogenic square in the old city. There is a smattering of restaurants but really most are here to take a photo and take it in.,October 2019,Place Outa el Hammam & Kasbah,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304013-d7222032-Reviews-Place_Outa_el_Hammam_Kasbah-Chefchaouen_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima.html,"Chefchaouen, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.0
Favourite Medina in Morocco,"I visited Marrakech, Fes, Meknes and Casablanca and this was by far my favourite Medina in Morocco. Unlike all the others one you are not constantly bombarded/harassed by sellers, they just sit back and let you ask them. Furthermore the blueness of it makes much more photogenic and it's small you are not going to get too lost. If you have a few weeks in Morocco definitely make time to visit here.",October 2019,Chefchaouen Medina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304013-d1751665-Reviews-Chefchaouen_Medina-Chefchaouen_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima.html,"Chefchaouen, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.5
Value for money,"This was a remarkably cheap place to stay at, the cheapest in 7 different towns in Morocco. There is quick WiFi with a lot of sockets to charge, which is a rarity in Morocco. There is a rooftop area with fantastic views of the surround blue city, some of the nicest views I have ever had at any hostel.There is a tiny kitchen but you can order food as well.
1 issue is with the showers, there was mostly cold water even though I kept getting told there is hot water. The only shower that had hot water is the one right beside the small kitchen on 3rd floor so use that shower. I wish they fix that but only real issue and still excellent value for money.",October 2019,Hostel Souika,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g304013-d1628334-Reviews-Hostel_Souika-Chefchaouen_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima.html,"Chefchaouen, Morocco",hotels,4.0,3.5
How to do day trip from Fes by yourself,"Before I came to Morocco I had no idea the Roman empire extended this far. Volubilis was the capital of the whole region so in the middle of nowhere are these ruins. They are now a UNESCO world heritage site which has recently been renovated. It now costs 70 to get in (I read it was much cheaper)
I did this as a daytrip by myself from Fes and if you want to do it how I did it was number 19 from old city to train station for 2.50, train to Meknes for 33 - they go every hour - I then walked about 15 minutes to grand taxi area and got a shared taxi to Moudray Idriss for 10. It's about 3km to Volubilis so can get a taxi but I walked there. you need about 2 hours to see the while site as it's quite big.
Overall it's a full daytrip but worth doing if you have time.",October 2019,Volubilis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g2626641-d324139-Reviews-Volubilis-Meknes_Tafilalet_Region.html,"Meknes-Tafilalet Region, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.5
Colourful,I was undecided whether to come here or not but curiosity got the best of me. I came here earlyish in the morning around 9 am ahead of the crowds and I recommend doing that. There are signs for it so it's relatively straight forward to find. There is a few shops you can go into and generally pay 5 or 10 to view it. People talk about the smell but honestly it's not too bad. It's fascinating to watch the process in action.,October 2019,Chouara Tannery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293733-d481056-Reviews-Chouara_Tannery-Fes_Fes_Meknes.html,"Fes, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.0
Ancient,This is a huge ancient centuries old souk/medina. If shopping or eating is your thing this is the place. Just explore and accept that the fact you will get lost. I was surprised the hawkers and sellers were not particularly pushy. Be careful against getting directions from someone as they are going to expect a tip.,October 2019,Medina of Fez,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293733-d318051-Reviews-Medina_of_Fez-Fes_Fes_Meknes.html,"Fes, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great filling food,"I came here about 5 over 6 times over a week and it is everything you would in a Moroccan restaurant. The staff are great with great English, which helps me out, and the food my goodness. I generally got the tacos with everything for 50 and it is huuuge, be hungry before you come here",October 2019,Snack Malak,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293733-d12177726-Reviews-Snack_Malak-Fes_Fes_Meknes.html,"Fes, Morocco",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Centre of local life,Lovely gate which marks the end of the road and start of the medina. I believe it was recently renovated and it is looking impressive and well kept. During the evening family's come out here to hang out which is nice to see.,October 2019,Place R’cif,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293733-d13199052-Reviews-Place_R_cif-Fes_Fes_Meknes.html,"Fes, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.0
Good backpackers hostel,"I stayed here nearly a week in a nice enough hostel. The staff are mainly volunteers which worked out well. There is a free breakfast everyday albeit you want to get there early as it tends to run out. There is a ton of seating areas to hang out in including a rooftop area with nice views of the city. There is free WiFi which is mostly quick and of course it is centre of old city. It isn't too hard to find either but use Maps.me and you should be grand.
My only real complaint is the lack of sockets, in 1 of the dorms there was 8 sockets but only 1 of them worked, could really do with a re-wiring.",October 2019,Funky Fes Hostel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293733-d2092388-Reviews-Funky_Fes_Hostel-Fes_Fes_Meknes.html,"Fes, Morocco",hotels,5.0,4.0
Beautiful architecture,Beautiful building and basically the sole reason I came to Casablanca. I didn't realise this but you can come and visit here for free at least on the outside. There are tours inside as well. A must visit for Casablanca.,October 2019,Hassan II Mosque,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293732-d317997-Reviews-Hassan_II_Mosque-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat.html,"Casablanca, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.5
Fine,This is an ok place comfortably the cheapest place in Casablanca that I could find. It's all a bit impersonal in a big building and staff are tad standoffish but rooms were fine and there was a decent free breakfast. There could be more sockets but for a night or 2 it does the job.,October 2019,Casablanca Youth Hostel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293732-d1549412-Reviews-Casablanca_Youth_Hostel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat.html,"Casablanca, Morocco",hotels,4.0,2.5
Heart of the city,An old school souk/market that is the heart of Essaouira and has been for centuries. I never bought anything but over the 2-3 days I stayed here walked through here everyday just take it all in.,October 2019,Medina of Essaouira,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298349-d324133-Reviews-Medina_of_Essaouira-Essaouira_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Essaouira, Morocco",attractions,5.0,4.5
Windy,"Nice, wide and quiet beach just south of the old city however it is bloody windy so not somewhere I would really sunbathe ,more one to go for a stroll down.",October 2019,Essaouira Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298349-d480529-Reviews-Essaouira_Beach-Essaouira_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Essaouira, Morocco",attractions,4.0,4.0
Fine,"This is pretty cheap place in the middle of the old city. It's a little tricky to find so I suggest using Maps.me to find it. It is spread over 4 floors with a really nice rooftop area to hang out in. There is also a nice seating area on the ground floor. WiFi is nice and quick and good enough to stream sports.
The rooms and bathrooms are bit cramped and rustic, some of the taps didn't work. You can pay for breakfast as well.
It's fine but feels a little run down and somewhere that could improve a lot with a little TLC.",October 2019,Essaouira Youth Hostel & Social Travel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298349-d1150675-Reviews-Essaouira_Youth_Hostel_Social_Travel-Essaouira_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Essaouira, Morocco",hotels,4.0,3.5
Lovely place,"Comfortably the best valued place in Imlil. I came here in September to escape the heatwave hitting Marrakesh. Mohammed who runs it is fantastic, really friendly and helpful.There is a free breakfast, a lovely rooftop area, fires for the winter and a ton of comfortable seats. It is right int he centre of Imlil. 1 thing though is the bed featured a scratchy dusty blanket, beds really need a sheet to place in between.
Aside from that a lovely place to stay.",October 2019,Imlil Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g488109-d3397053-Reviews-Imlil_Lodge-Imlil_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Imlil, Morocco",hotels,5.0,5.0
Centre of Marrakesh,Here is the spiritual and tourist central of Marrakesh. You have to brace yourself and be alert as people are always coming up to you with menus and such like. During the day you can get a much needed juice and go to souk; during the evening get a great dinner and catch some local culture. Be careful with your stuff.,September 2019,Jemaa el-Fnaa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293734-d318047-Reviews-Jemaa_el_Fnaa-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",attractions,4.0,4.0
Old souk,"An old school souk where you almost want to get lost.

Great value hostel,"I stayed here for a number of nights back at the end of September. The facilities are not amazing but look at the prices. I paid a few euro a night and with fast WiFi, free breakfast and ton of places to hang out (really needed during daytime as it was 40 degrees everyday) this still represents excellent value.",September 2019,Oasis Hostel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293734-d15612701-Reviews-Oasis_Hostel-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html,"Marrakech, Morocco",hotels,4.0,5.0
Dark history,"This is certainly unique. a relatively straight-forward daytrip from Prague. There are trains every 2 hours and easy to get tickets at the station. From the railway station it's about a 2 km walk to here but you can get a bus if you want.
The history is rather interesting. It was used to store remains of many many people who died in various wars, plagues that dotted European history and about 200 years ago someone decided to make all those skulls a little bit artistic.
I can safely say there is nowhere else quite like it.
Just note it's undergoing a big renovation.",September 2019,Ossario Di Sedlec,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608728-d18276727-Reviews-Ossario_Di_Sedlec-Sedlec_Central_Bohemian_Region_Bohemia.html,"Sedlec, Czech Republic",attractions,5.0,4.5
Colourful,"A ever-changing display of drawings, murals that are colourful but also have a deeper history to it. You could keep coming back as it is always getting altered.",September 2019,John Lennon Wall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d612140-Reviews-John_Lennon_Wall-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",attractions,5.0,3.5

Impressive,Hugely impressive building that dominates the Prague skyline. You can walk close to it for free but you have to pay to go in. I didn't go inside but definitely worth for visiting and seeing even from the outside.,September 2019,Prague Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d275235-Reviews-Prague_Castle-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",attractions,5.0,4.5
Over-Rated Clock,This is a nice design of a clock but massively over-rated. The hourly display is fine but not quite worthy of the attention of hundreds and hundreds of tourists. It in centre of the old town so worth seeing once but temper your expectations.,September 2019,Old Town Hall with Astronomical Clock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d275152-Reviews-Old_Town_Hall_with_Astronomical_Clock-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great hostel/Inn; great value,"I'm not going to lie a big reason I stayed here was because of the amazing name but it's much more than a name this is feels like a hotel but with the prices of a hostel. I stayed here for a week in a 8 bed dorm for an amazing price. The beds were comfy with sockets and a light beside each one, the room was clean and comfy and the bathroom/showers area was top notch. It is over 7 floors with all types of rooms. There is an attached cafe and bar as well. There is also a small kitchen but I do emphasise the word small, I wouldn't bank on making any big meals.

1 thing to note is the WiFi. It is very quick but in the room (and also kitchen weirdly) however in the reception comfy seating area it's really terrible and barely works. I find it so baffling why they don't just add an extra router for reception only.
Aside from that a great place to stay as for once comfort really doesn't have to come for a price.",September 2019,Czech Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274707-d618230-Reviews-Czech_Inn-Prague_Bohemia.html,"Prague, Czech Republic",hotels,5.0,4.5
History and views,"This makes a great daytrip from Bratislava. It's fairly easy to do by local transport. The bus goes around every hour and costs 2.90 return. It's about a 45 minute journey 1 way. it's €5 to get in and you have to pay with cash so bring some euros. You need about 2-3 hours to explore it.
There is a nice little museum with history of the castle and of what happened in 1989 when communism fell and people escaped across the Danube to freedom. The views of the Danube are tremendous. This was my highlight of my stay in Bratislava and definitely worth a daytrip.",September 2019,Devin Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274924-d290673-Reviews-Devin_Castle-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Memorial with views,I walked to here from the old city. It's a worth memorial to a terrible time and it also allows for some lovely views of Bratislava.

Nice old town,Lovely area to walk around and explore. A lot of day-trippers come from Vienna and visit in late morning and afternoon so it is worth staying at least 1 night to can walk around in the evening or early morning.,September 2019,Bratislava Old Town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274924-d290671-Reviews-Bratislava_Old_Town-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good views,This dominates central Bratislava and worthy of a visit. I didn't pay to go in anywhere I just strolled around and took the views in. There is surrounding gardens and nice views of the 'UFO'.,September 2019,Bratislava Castle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274924-d276280-Reviews-Bratislava_Castle-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great value hostel,"When I stayed last September this was by far the cheapest place to stay in Bratislava and it turned out to be nicer than I imagined. The beds were comfy with a socket beside them for charging, showers were fine. There is a big kitchen that is very well stocked, it's a really lovely kitchen. There is a nice hang out area with comfy seats and computers. There us also a bar an outside seating area so it's a social hostel without being too crazy, you also get a free drink. Finally there is something that you don't get often in hostels and free laundry! There is a washer and dryer with a line to hang your clothes as well, I can't believe they don't charge you for it and hopefully that continues!",September 2019,Patio Hostel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g274924-d627845-Reviews-Patio_Hostel-Bratislava_Bratislava_Region.html,"Bratislava, Slovakia",hotels,5.0,4.0

Place to hang out,"A really nice place to hang out, jog, go for a drink, walk, cycle, picnic and a lot more. There is fountain shows all days with different soundtracks on the hour.

Over the Danube we all go,1 part big transport hub across the Danube and another part tourist attraction. It can be sightly frustrating trying to walk across with the amount of tourists snapping pics especially sunset. The views of the bridge from the hills is in many ways more impressive than being on the bridge itself especially when you can see the parliament in the background.,September 2019,Széchenyi Lánchíd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274887-d276821-Reviews-Szechenyi_Lanchid-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html,"Budapest, Hungary",attractions,5.0,4.5
