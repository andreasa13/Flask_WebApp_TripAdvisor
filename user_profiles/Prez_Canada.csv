Underwhelming at best,"Hi,

This is one of my very few bad reviews about anything. Ordered a simple beef and shrimp soup with a side beef rice wraps. I had asked for the soup to be spicy as I did not have the menu on me and was driving. The soup broth is not spicy and taste like 80% fish sauce. The rice wraps we already ripped opened as well. I am rarely disappointed especially with a Vietnamese soup but it would be my advice to consider another location. It might be just a today issue as other people seemed to had positive experiences but I give my meal a 1.5/5",March 2021,Pho 99 Beef Noodle Soup Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155004-d4893294-Reviews-Pho_99_Beef_Noodle_Soup_Restaurant-Ottawa_Ontario.html,"Ottawa, Canada",restaurants,2.0,4.5
I am a big fan of middle eastern,I am a big fan of middle eastern food and I have to say that I have tried plethora of restaurants in the Ottawa Gatineau region. Amiral is a stand out among the mere mortals. Not only is the meat portion very generous at around 900 grams but the the items are overall are tastier than the competition. The generous portion and amazing taste makes it a no brainer at a price lower than the completion! Big fan and you should give it a shot.

Worth going for half a day,The ocean was rough when we were there and the beach vendors were everywhere but the experience was still good. I would recommend spending an afternoon here but nothing more. The water is beautiful and so is the sand but the lack of tranquility brings you back to earth. The best way to visit this beach is to make it part of an organised tour that stops here for a couple of hours.,February 2020,Playa Blanca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1507145-d2627873-Reviews-Playa_Blanca-Isla_Baru_Cartagena_District_Bolivar_Department.html,"Isla Baru, Colombia",attractions,4.0,3.5
Peaceful island with plenty of restaurants!,We loved Lipe. Two main streets going across the island are occupied by restaurants and shops. You will find every cuisine on this island. All bars close at around 11:00 pm to midnight which permits you to have a peaceful sleep. There are nice bungalows on the north east of the island north of sunrise beach. It is so easy to walk around the island and the island is extremely cozy. There are natural a lot of day trips to be done and luminescent plankton can be seen of shore at night when splashing the water on shore. Make sure to go to the Rockstones Bar in the middle of the island for a special treat ;).,December 2019,Ko Lipe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1024140-d2514150-Reviews-Ko_Lipe-Ko_Lipe_Satun_Province.html,"Ko Lipe, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.5

"Thursday ""Night"" Football","Was there for the Thursday Night NFL game on Nov. 7 2019. It was lovely to have access to the game with your feet in sand. I was the only person there since it was 10 am but the pints were delicious. The manager came out and said it was rare that people request NFL games and told me she also had Philip Rivers in her pool but that's a different story!

No the cheapest spot on the island but love the set up of the bar with tables, lounging areas and bar stools.

Average course at professional prices,The course originally established in 1907 as a 9 hole is now converted into an 18 hole course. The course in very green since water is close buy and this helps with irrigation. Some holes are very nice but a lot of them leave something to be desired.

1 year anniversary dinner,The restaurant has high ceilings and is not too crowded. The scallop dish was out of the world and the other dishes were nice as well.

Combination for two B,"We ordered the “Combinations served by the bowl For two (B)”. The Lamb Bhuna was to die for. The Mix Vegetable Curry was also pretty tasty however, we found the butter chicken to be a little too liquid and left a little to desire overall. A recommendation for the restaurant would be to serve at least two pieces of Naan with a dinner for two. Overall very satisfied and I will perhaps make my own combination next time as a spicy dish would have been lovely to compliment the supper.

Beach front hotel,"The hotel is located right on the beach with more than half the rooms facing the ocean. The beach front pool on the 3rd floor i believe which is the same floor as the checking lobby is great. The beach located right in front of the hotel is also convenient if you want to get massages and buy souvenirs. The beach is very busy with a lot of people offering to sell items such as beer and/or food such as oysters for example. For individuals seeking a more relaxed beach you can go south west to the beach facing westwards which is much more laid back from the hustle and bustle since most beach front properties are condos and not hotels therefore less touristy. Overall the hotel was good and you need to grab a taxi from the old town at night as it can get a little dark on the walk back. On the way back to the hotel there are police roadblocks that flag taxis and search individuals for drugs. A fine/bribe will be demanded upon not being compliant with the drug laws of Colombia. The rooms are clean and smell good and resemble the pictures already posted on TripAdvisor.

In conclusion, I spent 5 days at Intercontinental and it was good for a big group of us with the pool but for smaller groups I would recommend a rental in Old City as it is much more charming.",February 2020,InterContinental Cartagena De Indias,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297476-d6467868-Reviews-InterContinental_Cartagena_De_Indias-Cartagena_Cartagena_District_Bolivar_Department.html,"Cartagena, Colombia",hotels,4.0,4.0

Downtown at least,"This hotel is mostly rented by the government for temporary stay possibly for individuals that need medical assistance coming from rural parts of the province of Quebec from what I understood. This hotel is busy and very loud and was not ideal. I would suggest choosing another option. Also, I never had a hotel room with three locks which was not comforting.

"Complicated and much better options available, trust me on this one.","Considering that after a month of travel we had nothing but the best hospitality and service throughout the Philippines this place was a surprise to us.

The address given by booking.com was false and it lead me to a military base/housing (not sure). The address read as 13 West Point road whereas I believe it is KM 13 West Point road. I have no clue but ended up finding it after a long and costly taxi ride a 3 am. Once I finally reached the destination the staff was extremely rude and not helpful. I could possibly give them a pass as they were sleeping behind the front desk since it was the middle of the night however the same disrespectful service was given the second day and I am an outgoing polite and joly person. I was also given an access card that was cracked and when I returned it I was charged 500 pesos because it was damaged. The crack had gotten a bit larger and they refused to acknowledge that I was given a damaged card to start with.

"Busy, huge and scenic","My girlfriend and I were at the Port to catch a ferry to the Cyclades. The port is bustling with both a lot of people and a large amount of massive boats that are up to 7 stories. I was very impressed as it was our first time in a Mediterranean boat hub. Should you have a chance I would suggest saving some time to walk around as there are multiple interesting boutiques and restaurants in the charming streets of Piraeus which provide a taste of local culture.

On a more negative connotation you should be aware that there are a lot of pickpockets and my girlfriend let her guard down in our last 200 feet before getting on the cruiser and her iPhone got lifted from her pocket as she was walking right behind me. I had noticed a family of about 10 ""gia marias"" making weird movement beside us.

Slice of heaven,"We traveled a group of 4 friends in our early thirties to this beautiful beach front property in November 2010. I have to say that the one hour boat ride from the mainland in Belize City to the docks of the Tackle Box in San Pedro was magnificent. We had dolphins jumping out of the water following our boat and the closer we got to Ambergris Caye the clearer the water became. Upon arrival to the impressive Estates via water taxi we were greeted on the dock by a polite employee who provided us some warm wet hand towels to remove the salt water residue from our boat trip. We had no idea what to expect and we were quite impressed with everything and couldn't wipe the smiles of our faces while enjoying a welcome drink which was ready for us on our kitchen island in the condo. The hotel had reserved a golf cart for us which we would use to travel the island for the upcoming week and is a must to get around without having to wait on water taxis who also stop running after dark to prevent accidents from happening and to protect the aquatic ecosystem. There are very few cars or trucks on the island with golf carts being the main means of transportation.

Your to do checklist should include snorkeling and fishing which are truly wonderful experiences. Restaurants and bars/clubs in San Pedro are very affordable and offer various experiences to suit your mood for the day.

As for the condo itself you can view travelers' photos and admire the custom handmade finishes throughout.
