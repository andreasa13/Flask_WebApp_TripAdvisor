The Pizza is the Main Event,"Everyone in Connecticut has heard of Mystic Pizza, but somehow we had never been. We were in the area and made it a point that we’d be having pizza that day from Mystic.

After a photo shoot we were starving. We thought it’d be really busy, but it wasn’t too bad. There wasn’t a wait and we were seated and helped quickly.

We ordered a nice basic pizza - pepperoni. My rule of thumb is, if you mess up a simple pizza I wouldn’t trust you with anything else. We also ordered mozzarella sticks.

The mozz sticks came out suspiciously quick. Unfortunately, my suspicions were valid because these mozz sticks had sat for a while and the cheese wasn’t even cheesy anymore. We ate them, but they definitely weren’t anything to rave about. We were hoping the pizza experience wouldn’t be the same.

Pizza came out and it looked fresh! First slice was pulled and the cheese was CHEESY. The first bite - perfection. The breading was soft and airy. I love it! My fiancé raved about the sauce and my opinion on the pizza is at least top 3 in Connecticut. We had only gotten a small and I kind of regretted it, but figured I’ll just order a slice. The slice wasn’t as good so if you’re popping in, just get a freshly made pizza. I’m glad the pizza more than made up for the mediocre mozz sticks.

Tip - pass on appetizers and just order the pizza. If you’re really hungry, order a larger pizza, lol.

I’d recommend to a friend and will personally be back. I’m unsure why the rating for pricing is as high as it is. Our bill was extremely reasonable. A pizza, an extra slice of pizza, two fountain drinks, and the mozzarella sticks didn’t even break $30.",March 2021,Mystic Pizza,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33845-d466582-Reviews-Mystic_Pizza-Mystic_Mystic_Country_Connecticut.html,"Mystic, Connecticut",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Great Food, Great Local Beer Selection, Pricier","It’s relevant to say that during these Covid times it’s crucial you make reservations. Doc and every restaurant were almost all exclusively reservation only; even two of the breweries were.

With that said, we were lucky to get a 7:45 reservation. We called since the app’s latest reservation was 4:45 and we were able to get the later reservation.

The staff is great. They work quick, were helpful with the menu, and suggested items. I loved the huge selection of local beer. Alchemist the brewery was closed, but I was able to have a Heady Topper at Doc’s. It’s well known as one of the best beers of all time.

The burgers and fries were delicious. I would’ve expected the burger to come with fries but it doesn’t. We ordered a large basket to share.

Ultimately, it’s better quality bar food with a bit higher price tag. It would’ve been five stars if a burger just came with a side of fries instead of paying extra for them.",October 2020,Doc Ponds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57415-d8570916-Reviews-Doc_Ponds-Stowe_Vermont.html,"Stowe, Vermont",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Things to Love, Things to Dislike","Town & Country is a conveniently located hotel in Stowe.

What’s to love:
- Conveniently located near the center, food, breweries, and other places of interest
- Inexpensive
- Accommodating
- Updated
- Easy check in and check out

What’s to hate:
- Maintenance not keeping up with rooms
- Can be cleaner
- LOTS of spiders
- Reception not available often

Truly, this resort would’ve got 2.5 stars from me, but I rounded up instead of down for being accommodating.

The initial room was very small, but it was fine for our short 2 night stay. We dropped off our belongings and took off. Upon our return we get in and when we tried to close the door it wouldn’t close or lock. The door jamb looked complete broken like someone broke in, but it was obvious they hadn’t - at least not during our stay. I was able to get a hold of someone at the reception area and I demanded a room swap and upgrade for inconvenience. They were quick to satisfy.

The second room wasn’t very clean, but it was twice the size. I’m OCD so I flip a room around before I open any bags. I found dirty socks underneath the mattress, the area rug was stained, and it’s obvious the cleaning crew does a spritz and a wipe. There was a lot of dust under the beds.

The third room was the better of the three. It was much cleaner, as big as the second room, smelled clean, and it would do for our 2 night stay.

The rooms are updated, but hopefully maintenance and cleaning doesn’t allow them to go down hill again. I found old pictures from before the renovation and it was obviously much needed.

If you’re afraid of spiders - guests beware! There were about 3 in our room. I guess it’s expected in Vermont, but you’d think they’d deal with them during cleaning as it was obvious where they were. Our room wasn’t even cleaned on the second day we stayed. I don’t know if that’s due to Covid or not.

We considered ending our stay early the second day, but could not get a hold of reception all day. I even stopped into the lobby three times and no one was at the front desk.

All in all, an affordable stay in the heart of Stowe. It’s somewhat walkable with a 3-5 minute drive to some of the most frequented areas. I could handle a 1-2 night stay, but not much else.

Book it during off season when reception could be more accommodating. You’d be hard pressed to switch rooms during the busy season. A hotel this inexpensive is likely to be sold out. Kudos to reception for being accommodating when available.",October 2020,Town & Country Stowe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g57415-d252437-Reviews-Town_Country_Stowe-Stowe_Vermont.html,"Stowe, Vermont",hotels,3.0,4.0
"A Good Stop, Nice Views","Cold Hollow was our first stop when we arrived in Stowe. We were looking forward to tasting hard cider, non alcoholic cider, have cider food everything, and needed lunch after our 3 hour drive.

They had a decent selection for the flights. Our first order was placed at the counter near the entrance. They gave us a number and it would be announced while we sat and waited. This part was nice and quick.

I ordered the turkey club wrap and it was just “ok”. The maple Mayo made the meal, but I wasn’t that excited about it in general. The cider flight was good and my fiancé enjoyed her regular apple cider.

We stopped in to the store and that was cool. A lot of high priced items with opportunities to taste fresh apple cider. The cider donuts were cheap (.75) so that was nice.

We went back across the lot to grab another beer and this is were I felt like there just wasn’t enough staff. I went back to the same counter and the lady said I had to go to the bar. Ok, fine. I waited in the line there where only one person was pouring beer and running cards. When I finally got to the front to order a beer she said “oh, you can order that at the other counter”. Yes, the one that sent me to where I was. I mentioned this and she seemed confused, but helped me anyways. It was just a slow confusing process and they need more staff and better signage so you know where to place your order.

All in all, a good stop in the center of town.",October 2020,Cold Hollow Cider Mill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57439-d560713-Reviews-Cold_Hollow_Cider_Mill-Waterbury_Center_Vermont.html,"Waterbury Center, Vermont",attractions,3.0,4.0
Tasty Pizza,"The fiancé and I stopped in on our first night in Stowe. We figured we couldn’t really go wrong with pizza.

Getting seated during these Covid times was quick and easy. The waitress hand sanitized between tables and after dropping something off at our table every time. We appreciated their level of cleanliness. Wear a mask to walk to your table or bathroom.

We’re basic pizza eaters that they don’t like crazy toppings, but we’re also from Connecticut where several of the country’s top pizza restaurants are located, lol. This means we can be hard pizza critics. This pizza hit the spot! It was perfect thin crust baked to perfection, not too greasy, very flavorful with tasty pepperonis, and inexpensive.

We highly recommend Piecasso for an easy lunch or dinner option!",October 2020,Piecasso Pizzeria & Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57415-d409377-Reviews-Piecasso_Pizzeria_Lounge-Stowe_Vermont.html,"Stowe, Vermont",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Not as busy as Cadillac Mountain, but just as beautiful!","I specifically visited because I wanted to check out Raven’s Nest. I didn’t know that this area was another national park with its own pull off stops that had amazing views.

Once you enter the “one way”, it’s about a 18 to 22 minute drive around the NP. There are many options for you. You can park at the visitor center and do one of the many trails or you can drive the loop and temporarily park in the pull off spots to visit the different vantage points.

I DEFINITELY encourage you to stop for Raven’s Point. The pull off is on your left and you’ll see a small unmarked path on your right (across the street). It’s a little dangerous for children so be careful if they are super active.

I saw many people walking the loop and biking it so those are options as well. I liked how it was less hectic and busy than Cadillac Mountain. You almost feel like you have the park to yourself.

You’ll need the $30 parking pass (or whatever it is if you pay for the yearly parking pass). No one is really enforcing it, but it’s also a $150 ticket if you park and don’t have it. If you’re just driving the loop, I wouldn’t bother getting one. You can see the beauty from your car, but you’ll miss some nice stops; that’s your choice.

Some people think it’s an additional parking pass for this location, but the $30 is for a one week parking passing for ALL national parks. It’s the same one that’ll allow you to park at Cadillac Mountain.",October 2020,Schoodic Peninsula,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60709-d1219104-Reviews-Schoodic_Peninsula-Bar_Harbor_Mount_Desert_Island_Maine.html,"Mount Desert Island, Maine",attractions,5.0,5.0

When you park, walk around behind the restaurant.",October 2020,Jordan Pond,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g143010-d109738-Reviews-Jordan_Pond-Acadia_National_Park_Mount_Desert_Island_Maine.html,"Mount Desert Island, Maine",attractions,5.0,4.5
An Unbelievable Sunrise Experience,"I’ve been a morning person as long as I can remember and, fittingly, catching the sunrise on Cadillac Mountain has been on my to do list for quite some time. If you’re lucky enough to go between October and, I believe, March you’ll have bragging rights at saying you’ve experienced the first sight of sunrise in the continental US.

My short review is that Cadillac Mountain is breath taking. The sunrise is EVERYTHING you’ve heard it was, and pictures do not do it justice. My recommendation is to read through my review for important tips (timing, cost, arrival, etc).

If you’re still with me, here’s my detailed review. I drove from Connecticut the night before. It’s hard to predict the perfect weather for a sunrise on Cadillac. As a lot of the “bad reviews” have mentioned (I really don’t understand why people negatively rated it due to weather) Cadillac Mountain is known for THICK fog. I followed the weather in Bar Harbor and the summit all week. I knew I had a really good chance at a clear sunrise and I wasn’t disappointed. I still experienced fog driving up and was even doubtful I’d get anything come sunrise, but I was lucky and a little planning went a long way.

If you’re crazy enough like me and didn’t want to pay for lodging, my recommendation is to drive to the Walmart and sleep in your car; it’s about 35-40 mins to the summit from there. The Irving gas station near by has a public restroom and it’s open 24x7. It’s allowed to sleep in the lot of the Walmart and you’ll be in good company. Some people slept in their cars at the summit, but I don’t recommend it. It’s technically not legal. That’s not to say you can’t drive up whenever you want because you can. Up until today, the mountain is open 24x7 and they only close the gate during inclement weather. However, if they have the slightest inclination that you’re sleeping on the summit, they’ll send you back down.

There are no fees to get on the mountain or Acacia National Park in general. I say this because it’s completely free to bike, walk, or drive the grounds. However, there is a $30 national park parking fee for the day. There’s a few more options if you want to buy a year pass. My suggestion is buy it and print it online before you get there. It’s used for ALL national parks. Will they check for it? Highly unlikely. Is it worth the risk? Nope! It’s a $150 ticket if they decide to go check cars for the parking pass.

In addition to the parking fee they’ve begun a reservation system. It’s due to the extremely high traffic during rush hour (sunrise & sunset). You make the reservation for a certain time slot online for $2.00. I think 60% of the available slots are released 48 hours in advance (10:00a sharp) and the remaining slots at some point prior. My opinion is that it’s a terrible system. If you’re trying to plan a clear sunrise or time the foliage, these slots will be sold out before you can make an informed decision. With that said, as of writing this the time slots are enforced between 4:30a and 6:30p. I didn’t have a reservation and I was able to drive up at 3:00a with no issues at all. I highly recommend driving up early. If you think you’re going to drive up 30 mins before sunrise, expect to sit in traffic and miss it completely. I called and spoke to three different rangers and they confirmed there is no issue driving up before 4:30a and that they aren’t timing anyone or kicking them off the mountain. My advice, start driving up before 4:00a when the first rangers arrive. The reservation is ONLY if you’re driving and parking. If you’re hiking up or biking up, you do not need a reservation.

Where the heck do I stand? That’s the million dollar question! When you arrive it’s likely going to be dark and you won’t know where to walk, stand, or look. It’s really hard to miss. To the right of the informational sign there’s a small path. Just walk forward and get out on the granite stone. Anywhere is fine. The further out you walk the better. This will ensure you’re ahead of everyone. You don’t need to walk very far though and the colder it is, the less people you’ll be racing for a prime spot. I’d say get out there 40 mins before sunrise time to capture all the different colors as the sky changes. Don’t leave before the sun actually makes an appearance. It’ll creep up in the horizon.

On your way down there’s plenty to see and many pull off locations. In the morning sun there’s a lot of shadows being casted. You may want to return when the sun is higher in the sky. My favorite spot besides the sunrise on the summit was Jordan Pond. You see it best and most dramatically behind the restaurant. There’s a path around back.",October 2020,Cadillac Mountain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g143010-d108269-Reviews-Cadillac_Mountain-Acadia_National_Park_Mount_Desert_Island_Maine.html,"Mount Desert Island, Maine",attractions,5.0,5.0
Wonderful Breakfast and A Warm Welcome,"I was in Bar Harbor from Connecticut for the day. I drove in the night before to catch a gorgeous sunrise on Cadillac Mountain and after a long night and morning I needed a big breakfast.

I found this place on TA with great reviews and decided to give it a shot. It was a quick 20 minute wait.

The menu has plenty of options from breakfast burritos and pancakes to eggs and lobster sandwiches. I decided on the the larger breakfast dish with 2 pancakes (requested blueberry pancakes), your choice of meat, eggs, home fries, and a thick slice of sourdough bread. It was out in less than 15 mins and did NOT disappoint.

If you’re in Bar Harbor, stop in. The breakfast is delicious, but truly the staff is what made me happy. A bunch of smiling faces ready to satisfy your hunger!

Fun!,"I visited Mission Escape Games for my birthday yesterday with my fiancé, best friend, and his girlfriend. Three of us had done escape rooms in the past and one hadn’t.

Justin was our game master and he was great. He gave us the rules, explained the room, and let us get to it.

The room itself is well done. There are some surprises and unexpected things. That’s all I’ll say without ruining anything. We were all competitive and asked what the success rate was (less than 50%). It’s turned out that it was less than 40%. Happy to say we were one of few groups that escaped successfully and with more than 20 minutes left on the clock!

"Get Married in Paradise, Get Married At Kukua","Understandably, some people don’t want to read a long review. The short version is: Kukua is absolutely amazing and if you’re planning a destination wedding to Punta Cana you shouldn’t be considering any other venue! Kukua is AMAZING from the venue, service, food, drinks, decor ... EVERYTHING.

For those that want EVERY detail, I also have you covered. We started our search and, like most couples, compared venues once we decided on Punta Cana.

Responsiveness: Without a doubt, Kukua was the most responsive of all the venues we were considering. You can thank Rachel of Kukua for that. You’ll get the same attentive, detail oriented service from Rachel from the very beginning of the planning stages until you walk the aisle. You can bet on getting responses the very same day; most often within a couple of hours of your emails. You’ll also have several calls to make sure all your worries are set to rest.

Service: Spectacular! Rachel is the voice over the phone that prepares you for Kukua and once you arrive at the venue you’ll notice everyone you interact with is as kind and attentive. It’s literally the culture of the venue. Maite was amazing during our tasting and took notes to prepare for our wedding date. The waiters were spectacular and so attentive. Always smiling and always ready to help you out in a possible way.

Venue: Beautiful! You’ll literally be getting married in paradise. The venue is located on the beach and has the perfect beach breeze you hope for. When we walked into the bride/maids “getting ready” room our jaws dropped. We couldn’t believe how gorgeous it was. There will also be several options for your layout depending on where you want to get married (beach or not), if you want to be seated facing these beach (or prefer you guest face the beach), etc.

Food/Drinks: DELICIOUS! I’ll start with two words: Passionfruit Mojito! It’s no wonder just about everyone talks about it. It was so good it will be one of our signature drinks! All the food was cooked to perfection. Your guests will not go hungry. Rachel was great running through our food items and letting us know where we picked too much food for our guest count. This shows a lot about Kukua. They aren’t in it to just make money. If they can save you money, keep you on budget, and still give you the wedding you’ve dreamed of ... THEY WILL.

Closing Words: I really don’t know how anyone chooses anything besides Kukua. I’m a hard critic, but Kukua has left nothing but positive memories I tell everyone about. We are excited to have chose Kukua and you will too!

"Memorable Hike, Great Views","I just tackled Monadnock with friends over Labor Day Weekend. I loved every second of the climb, the views offered, and the occasional challenges along the way.

You’ll want to reserve parking ($15 at the time of writing) via their website. They have limited “first come first serve” parking spots, so it’s just best you reserve ahead of time. Bring sufficient water and/or sufficient water bottles to fill up outside of the restrooms. I had about 64 oz on me and felt good with that, but could’ve done with maybe another 32 oz myself.

The bathrooms are extremely clean for a state park bathroom and I’m glad the $15 parking charge is very obviously going towards the upkeep of the state park and it’s services.

On to the hike! We took the white dot trail up. I wouldn’t say I’m an experienced hiker, but I am a fitness enthusiast and I’m in good shape. Overall, the hike never felt impossible. There were some areas where you want to be mindful of footing, but with enough breaks I think the majority of people could accomplish the climb provided they have some experience. The first 25-30 mins were relatively easy and then it increases in difficulty when you begin dealing with rocky terrain. Foot placement is everything during some portions of the hike.

The views are truly incredible especially on a clear day. There are about 3-4 really good “outlook” stopping points - one, of course, being the summit. I’m excited to return during the foliage season as I can only imagine how much more breath-taking it will be.

We took white dot to white cross when we descended and that seemed to be the better decision. The white dot trail all the way would’ve been a little more challenging due to steepness and slipperiness going down and after climbing, the last thing you want is bad footing on the way down and getting hurt. My recommendation is taking the same white dot to cross trail down as we took.

Conclusion - it’s an incredible hike. It’ll be challenging, it’ll be fun, and you’ll definitely earn whatever snack or meal you bring to the summit (yes, bring some fuel food).",September 2020,Mount Monadnock State Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g46129-d104266-Reviews-Mount_Monadnock_State_Park-Jaffrey_New_Hampshire.html,"Jaffrey, New Hampshire",attractions,5.0,4.5
Highest Peak in Connecticut,"I’ve had Bear Mountain on my “hiking to-do list” for quite some time. Knowing it was the highest peak IN Connecticut made it more exciting for me. There’s a mountain in Connecticut with a higher peak, but although you start the hike in Connecticut, the peak is actually in Massachusetts. So, Bear Mountain it was!

We got started early on a Saturday morning (August). We were there at about 8:30-8:45a. There’s a small parking lot with a blue oval sign. I got lucky enough to get a spot, but at that time there were limited spaces already.

The hike itself was great. The trails are well marked and easy to follow. We took the blue blazed trail to paradise trail and then jumped on the white blazed trail (left) at the AT crossing. The last 15 mins of the hike were challenging. It’s all mostly rocks and you’ll have to do some scaling on a few of them. My friend and I consider ourselves very fit and both agreed the last bit was challenging.

My only disappointment and the reason for 4/5 instead of 5/5 was due to the summit. It was a little underwhelming. There was a structure built of rocks where you climb up for the outlook. If you bring your kids or dogs, be careful. Some of the rocks are a little loose, especially on the edge.",August 2020,Bear Mountain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33910-d6483354-Reviews-Bear_Mountain-Salisbury_Connecticut.html,"Salisbury, Connecticut",attractions,4.0,4.5
The Definition of Tropical Paradise,"Saona was absolute paradise. This review is specifically about the island and not the excursion company that took us there.

We had an opportunity to spend about 2.5-3 hours on the island. It’s picturesque, the sand is a fine white, the palm trees are made for photographs, there are hammocks to relax and take a nap while the waves crash and the wind blows through the trees. The water is crystal clear.

We had an opportunity to visit a natural pool prior to making the stop on the beach. The water went up to your waist and you had the opportunity to see starfish. If you go - DO NOT take the starfish out of the water for more than 3 seconds, as we were told.

Our last stop before returning provided us an opportunity to snorkel and see many fish.

"Beautiful Resort, Great Value, Staff Works Hard!","I feel that it’s very important to start this review by saying that this review reflects Ámbar during the Covid pandemic. Certain services are altered in order to provide the safest experience for all guests.

With that said, we have enjoyed our stay at Ámbar. It has been a pleasure.

Check In: It was a breeze. We were checked in within 10 mins of arriving. We didn’t receive our room until 3:00pm which is the standard time and understandable since they are going above and beyond sanitizing rooms before a new guest stays in it. We were allowed to eat at the buffet before getting our room and check out the grounds.

Room: We chose a basic room. We asked about upgrades and although we didn’t get any complimentary upgrade, they did offer upgrading to a swim out for a good price. We passed, but on another occasion/trip we might’ve jumped on the deal.

The room was spotless when we got in. It was much larger than in pictures. The bathroom has a waterfall shower and large sink area. We didn’t watch tv, but it worked. The safe was easy to use. The mini bar fridge had some drinks. Due to Covid they didn’t refill them, but you could request it.

Staff: Phenomenal! They go above and beyond to make you happy. They serve with a smile on their face. The entertainment staff works very hard. Oscar, the entertainment director, was amazing! I was glad to meet him during our stay.

The room was cleaned every day and the cleaning staff was great even by my very high cleaning standards, lol.

Pool/Grounds: I don’t know if it was that hot Caribbean sun, but the pool almost felt like it was heated. I never confirmed whether it was or wasn’t, but it felt great! There was a life guard on duty, no table side service, but getting a drink was easy enough.

The grounds were kept very clean and the staff was constantly cleaning and sanitizing.

The beach had seaweed, sure. However, the staff was up at 6:30a every morning cleaning it up before people got on the beach. How much seaweed you’ll see on your trip depends when you come, but rest assured that the staff is doing their very best to keep it clean. We got a better area by walking a few hundred feet down the beach.

Something that definitely deserves mentioning is that the beach is wheelchair accessible! I’ve never seen this anywhere else I’ve been. There’s a boardwalk that leads to several areas where someone in a wheelchair could access and enjoy with everyone else. I loved that!

Food: it was alright for an all inclusive. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t over the top amazing. You won’t go hungry and there are plenty of options. Reservations are made through the app upon arrival. Pro tip: you can make reservations two weeks before arriving by sending the resort an email. I suggest it as we weren’t able to enjoy all the restaurants due to limited spacing, especially because of Covid distancing rules.

Loved the coffee shop. Great coffee and tasty pastries.

Covid Rules: this is specifically for my stay. It could be a little different for you as Covid cases improve. The swim up pool bar was closed, but you can get out and get a drink at the bar.

You must wear masks at the restaurants when walking in and to your table. At the buffet, you must wear a mask to go get food. You won’t be picking your own food. Someone will be there to put it on your plate. PLEASE people, read the signs. A couple of people went around the barrier and started serving themselves. The staff was not happy about this. Just be patient.

You don’t need to wear masks in any open air areas (pool, beach, walking around).

Club/disco was closed. The village was closed.

Tourism lives! All excursions were available fo reserve. HIGHLY recommend Saona!

"Small, Just Ok","We took a trip to the Franklin Zoo on a Saturday. We purchased our tix online for about $18 pp. Arrival and parking was easy. Parking is free and there are at least two lots.

Due to Covid you chose an arrival time slot for your tix. We got into the zoo quickly and it wasn’t crowded at all. Our first stop was the bathrooms after our two hour drive. They were less than pleasurable. I was surprised during these Covid times. You’d think they’d be spotless or at least much cleaner.

We made our way through the zoo and weren’t really impressed by anything. There weren’t many animals in the exhibits. We saw a lot of birds. The butterfly exhibit wasn’t functional. Seeing the giraffes was cool and we saw two lions. Everything else seemed “average”.

You get your chicken, you get your sausage, you get perfectly cooked pasta with delicious Alfredo sauce, red peppers, and all made spicy without going overboard. My fiancé had the chicken parm and she LOVED it.

They provide large portions and plenty to get full and take home.

The service was great and fast. During Covid so they did have outdoor dining, but I’m not sure if that the norm.

Make this a stop on your Boston trip.

Pro Tip: it’s across from Mike’s Pastry Inc - leave room for dessert.",July 2020,Carmelina's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60745-d3567563-Reviews-Carmelina_s-Boston_Massachusetts.html,"Boston, Massachusetts",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Moderately Intense, Short Hike with Beautiful Views","You can get to Castle Craig by driving up, hiking up (through the woods), or walking up the paved path. We chose to hike up. The hike was short, but moderately intense. It has several very steep climbs that are totally doable. It gets rocky at the tail end. The path isn’t very well marked, but it’s hard to get lost. It’s well traveled.

There are two areas to “summit”. On one side you’ve got Castle Craig. It provides a nice safe view. I’d love to go back in the Fall for New England foliage. On the other side (a 4 minute walk from where Castle Craig is) you get a nice view of Castle Craig from across. I prefer this view to get pictures and avoid the crowd.

Pro Tip: if you choose the path that starts closest to the Hubbard Park entrance, you’ll want to look out for the bridge that gets you over the highway. It’s not obvious, but you need to get over this to continue towards Castle Craig. If you continue going straight instead you’ll almost immediately end up near the street and you’ll need to turn back around to get to the bridge that gets you over the highway.

Spend some time in Hubbard Park. It reminds me of a miniature Central Park. It’s really beautiful with a couple of waterfalls, a pond, and a nice view of the trails/forest. I’ll definitely be returning for foliage photography.",May 2020,Castle Craig,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33833-d8380317-Reviews-Castle_Craig-Meriden_Connecticut.html,"Meriden, Connecticut",attractions,4.0,4.5

Memorable Deliciousness,"My fiancé and I were celebrating our second to last anniversary as an unmarried couple. We decided to give The Melting Pot a first try. Neither of us had ever done anything like it.

The short version is, we both got a lot more than we expected in a very positive way.

The longer version is for the foodies. First of all, Shirley our server was amazing. She was very patient and we had a lot of questions. She provided recommendations and made welcomed small talk. We really felt comfortable with her. We mentioned it was our anniversary in passing and she made sure to make it memorable.

We splurged with the four course meal. It all started with a delicious cheese dip with an assortment of apples, breads, and vegetables to dip. The cheese was so cheesy and delicious.

Next, we were given our salads - a Caesar salad and a house special. Both were fresh and tasty!

At this point we weren’t stuffed yet. That would change quickly. The third course was all our meats. You have about 4-5 ways you can choose to cook your meats. We chose a caldron. Everything was seasoned perfectly. It was such a great experience to cook your own meats (sirloin, pork, chicken, shrimp, salmon). It gives you time to hold conversations, trade food, and really enjoy the moment. By the time we finished this third course we were nearing the tipping point. The best part was coming!

The last course was the dessert. An assortment of fruits and sweets (cookies, brownies, waffles) to dip in the dark chocolate we chose. Everything was delicious and fresh, and the chocolate was rich!

Shirley was amazing and brought out a special slice of cake with the words “Happy Anniversary” written on the plate. It was so thoughtful of her.

We highly recommend The Melting Pot for your special occasion or just for an amazing experience in general. We loved it and we hope to be back soon.",December 2019,The Melting Pot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33755-d2086563-Reviews-The_Melting_Pot-Darien_Connecticut.html,"Darien, Connecticut",restaurants,5.0,4.0

The breakfast sandwiches are made on authentic Spanish bakery bread, buttered, and toasted.

Didn’t Do It For Us,"We were looking for a place that would deliver. It turned out one of the delivery apps would, so we ordered from Sofia’s because the rating was so strong. We ordered a large pizza (half was pepperoni and the other chicken, mushrooms, and red & green peppers) and wings with the sauce on the side.

Our first issue was the price. We paid $57 for what we ordered. This was easily the most expensive pizza I’ve ever paid for. I had gourmet deep dish pizza in DC for less than this! We figured we were already 90% done with the order so we hoped the reviews meant the price was worth it.

The second issue is they didn’t add the red peppers. For a pizza so expensive you want to make sure you’ve got ALL your toppings and we double checked - we definitely had it on the order.

Third, all the food items were very bland. The sauce was tasteless, the chicken on the pizza seemed unseasoned, and even the cheese wasn’t sharp and rich. The chicken wings were super bland and the BBQ sauce on the side didn’t do much to save it.

The only saving grace was that the slices were large, but for $57 it’s certainly not worth it.

Is this real life?,"Our trek for the sunset started at about noon from Firostefani. We had limited time in Santorini and decided we'd do a partial Fira to Oia hike. If you have the option, start your hike before 10a.

After several hours of hiking we arrived at our photography post. We decided on setting up camp at Oia Castle. I highly recommend this location for the best view. Set up on the ledge looking out towards the windmill. We arrived about 90 minutes before sunset. My fiance and I were 2 of 4 people. Not long after we set up our cameras this location started getting packed. 20 minutes before sunset some people started to get pushy. There wasn't enough room on the ledge for them so they'll have to try again some other day. It blew my mind that other photographers (judging by their equipment) didn't think to get to the most popular location to view the sunset earlier than 15-20 minutes before the sunset. We had a good spot and let the others scramble around while we enjoyed our snacks and waited for the ""feature film"". This location was very crowded (almost shoulder to shoulder). The best seats were on the ledge since it kept you away from the crowd.

Needless to say, Oia provided us the most magnificent view of the sunset I have ever seen. The colors were so rich and vibrant. The lower it dropped into the horizon the deeper the hues got. While the sun set there were some marriage proposals, when the last bit of sun fell beneath the horizon people clapped, cheered, and whistled. I mean, literally, everyone in Oia watching the sunset cheered. It was truly a once in a lifetime experience that I hope to experience more than once in my lifetime.

My tips:

Arrive early, and sit on the ledge - people will try and ""squeeze in"", but don't let them. For the sake of your equipment (if you bring a camera and tripod), and to reduce the risk of getting hurt, allow yourself plenty of space. I recommend arrive at least an hour before, an hour and a half to be safe.

Choose Oia Castle as your post unless you have a resort that faces the sunset. In my opinion, it's one of the best locations to view the sunset.

Get some snacks and wine. You'll have to camp out for at least an hour so you might as well keep full and enjoy Santroini's other glory ... wine.

Don't rush out after the sunset. This photographers advice is ... enjoy blue hour as well.

While enjoying the sunset make sure to ENJOY the sunset. Yes, I brought my camera to take pictures, but don't be one of hundreds that only enjoys the sunset through their lens. Set it on a timer, or take pictures every few minutes, but leave time to enjoy it IN PERSON with your person or family.",July 2019,Sunset in Oia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g482941-d3369820-Reviews-Sunset_in_Oia-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A good time walking around.,"I visited Pittsburgh in August for a technology convention. During my time there I frequented North Shore trail quite a bit. It was a good place to run, walk, bike, enjoy the skyline, checkout PNC Park, etc. Coincidentally, there was supposed to be a boat festival and even though it was canceled there were still many boats out enjoying a sunny Sunday afternoon.

There's also a place to rent kayaks so check that out as well. My favorite time to checkout North Shore trail was at night. They have a really cool skyline. My favorite spot was between Roberto Clemente Bridge and the Andy Warhol Bridge.

My tip(s) would be that you're very close to PNC Park, the Roberto Clemente Statue, Heinz Field, etc. I'd say this is the center of it all and you aren't too far from some of Pittsburgh's main attractions from here.

Interesting Boarding Process,"The first strike against Delta came when they decided to board to two planes simultaneously with the gates adjacent to each other. It was difficult to hear which gate was boarding which tiered class and there was some obvious confusion among passengers.

The second strike against Delta came when I realized they didn't follow the typical boarding process. Usually airlines board you by groups so it becomes very obvious if you're the next group to board. Delta, however, has basic, comfort, premium, and some other tiers. Unless you frequently fly Delta, you're probably going to have a hard time finding out if you're next to board or not.

The flight, otherwise, was smooth and we arrived on time.

I didn't dock any points for this next comment as this isn't Delta's fault. As a passenger, make sure you disembark the plane in the same order as your seats. Trying to get ahead will only make the process slower. Are you about to miss a flight? Guess what! There's probably 30 or 40 other people that need to rush to their connecting flight as well.",November 2019,Delta Air Lines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729060-Reviews-Delta-Air-Lines,World,flights,3.0,4.0
"Drink, Dance, and Eat","I was born in Puerto Rico and have visited many times after moving away, but this was my first time in Guavate. I didn't know what to expect other than really amazing pernil (pork) according to every review.

After driving up we found reasonable parking for $3.00 USD. We crossed the street to the first location and there was a live band playing merengue. As soon as they finished another band would begin. There was nonstop music (merengue, bachata, salsa) and nonstop dancing. Whether you intend to dance or want to watch seasoned dancers show off their skills - this is the place to go. It was equally fun joining the dancers as it was seeing people enjoy themselves. I felt at home - and I was!

There were multiple places to get drinks and food and the pricing was extremely reasonable. A huge mojito was less than $8.00 USD. We got food across the street where $60-70 USD was enough to get food for about 8 of us: pernil, rice, guineito (type of boiled banana), and many other items. We ordered 6 shots for our group and that was less than $20.00 USD. This is the place to go if you're on a budget and want to have some authentic Puerto Rican fun!

You'll also find a few gift shops that are also reasonably priced.

I highly recommend visiting Guavete. My only advice for people who aren't used to driving in PR is that the road up is not for the faint of heart. I say that because driving back down can be tricky. If you're up for it, in my opinion, it's not too bad. Otherwise, there are some party buses that are part of excursions that will take you there.

Get there about 12:00pm and stay until it closes (7:00pm) You won't regret it!

For the MAIN reason people come to Cafe Marquesa: Red Velvet pancakes. You read it here - GET THESE PANCAKES. These pancakes are absolutely delicious.

You haven’t gone to Geronimo’s if you haven’t had the guac!,"Geronimo’s is an authentic Mexican restaurant in the center of New Haven.

This restaurant has a great patio that’s open all year round since it has plenty of heating for the colder months. Arrive early or make a reservation because it will get packed.

The food and drinks are phenomenal! For drinks I highly recommend a Paloma. They’re the best I’ve had here. My fiancé also got a coconut mojito and it was perfectly mixed. Plenty of that classic mojito taste with a noticeable hint of coconut.

The food is authentic so if you don’t like spicy, make sure to mention it. I had the chicken quesadillas with no changes and I absolutely loved them.

The highlight at Geronimo’s is the table side guac. You haven’t been if you haven’t had it. It’s the best I’ve had anywhere ... period! You have the option of mild, medium, or very spicy. I got medium and there was plenty of kick without being overwhelming. It’s a MUST if you stop in.

I highly recommend the coconut pancakes, the California omelette, and the French toasts. Those are all great choices.

They also do boozy brunch on Sundays with bottomless mimosas. I’m deducting one star for speed of service. When we went on a Sunday for bottomless mimosas it took a while to get refills.

Galactic Pizza,"We were heading out to Salem and needed to find a restaurant for our first spot. Pizza seemed the safest bet with a crowd of 6. One person needed gluten free options and this place fit the bill.

We were quickly seated and handed the drink and food menus. They’ve got a large selection of beer and do offer flights for $8. It was a deal! I had a flight and then ordered an Apple cider beer - highly recommend it if you like ciders.

They’re also well known for their mimosas. They ran out of the Apple cider mimosa, but their grapefruit was great. My fiancé had a flight of mimosas. Very cool!

The pizza was very good. They’re known for their thin crust pizza. We ordered the sour dough pizza which was supposed to be thicker, but looked identical to the thinner crust pizzas at the table. That wasn’t a big deal because the pizza hit the spot anyway. We also ordered Space Balls for an app. I’d pass next time. It’s not a must have for me.

Great Tour Guide and Informative Tour,"We were surprised to see so many things closed around 5:00p. We figured there had to be a night tour and stumbled across the Witch Walk. It was an inexpensive $20. For the money, you go on a tour and are also given a candle.

We didn’t know what to expect for the tour, but it was totally worth the $20. I won’t ruin the “theme”, but if you’re really open minded you’ll end the tour and be grateful for new found information and a way of thinking. I recommend this tour!

If you want to go big or go home you can add pulled pork! The Samuel Adams beer garden is a must stop for beer drinkers and so is the lesser known Opa Opa.

"Great Breakfast, Conveniently Located","I’m really surprised about the only other review on this location. I thought, first and foremost, that this location was conveniently located. It’s right next to the Fabrika bus station. Understandably, the area is extremely busy and crowded.

Even with a busy area my fiancé and I received great service. We sat outside and were quickly visited by the waitress which just so happens to be the cook’s wife. She got us started with some delicious coffees and we placed our order.

I ordered the crepe with fruits, my girlfriend had a simple ham and cheese sandwich with a bowl of assorted fruits. We didn’t have the most complicated order, but everything came out timely and delicious. The fruits were very fresh and the meals delicious and hot.

I’d recommend this place. Stop in and enjoy the small Greece/Mykonos feel and welcoming. My only recommendation is to lower the prices just a little. There are cheaper breakfast spots near by, but not as good. We know because we tried them, lol.",July 2019,Life Coffee & Snacks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g662620-d17763403-Reviews-Life_Coffee_Snacks-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",restaurants,4.0,2.0
Food Coma - Amazing Food,"Los Andes is Providence’s number one restaurant. Anytime I’m visiting the city I want to make sure I find great restaurants I can recommend to friends and family. This is definitely one of those places.

Los Andes came HIGHLY recommended. We got lucky enough to get a reservation at 5:00p. That only happened because of a cancellation. My advice is to put your reservation in early! We were quickly seated.

There were four people at the table and three of us ordered chaufa, I can’t remember the name of the fourth plate, but it’s pictured, and we ordered the ceviche as an appetizer. The chaufa was absolutely delicious. Be warned, these plates are HUGE. We realized we could’ve probably shared a plate between two people and still had left overs. We were going out for drinks later that night so the leftovers were great to return to that night!

I was excited about the yucca fries, but they weren’t great. It was the only thing I didn’t “love”. However, I asked for “special” sauce made of mayo and ketchup. They don’t carry it, but the waitress was kind enough to find mayo and make it for me anyway. Big points earned for going the extra mile!

Los Andes is a must! It’s inexpensive and even more so if you decide to share. Sharing is advisable since these plates are massive.",September 2019,Los Andes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60946-d2103909-Reviews-Los_Andes-Providence_Rhode_Island.html,"Providence, Rhode Island",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Deliciously Authentic Mexican Cuisine,"I was in town visiting and my friend had a list of top Providence restaurants we’d be visiting. He described this one as one of the best hole in the wall spots and he wasn’t lying.

We were lucky enough to arrive right before it got busy on a Saturday afternoon. We were quickly seated and provided water, delicious tortilla chips, and amazing salsa. If you’re sensitive to spicy food beware of the salsa. This isn’t your chain food restaurant kind of salsa. With that said, it’s the best salsa I’ve been given.

Everyone at the table pretty much ordered an assortment of tacos. They were really cheap and they had 4-5 different kinds. All of mine were great and everyone at the table thought the same about theirs. Ask for salsa picante. There are two; the red one is much spicier.

Along with our food we also ordered a pitcher of margaritas. Amazing! You’ll feel great walking out. It was enough to provide everyone about a cup and a half.

This place is definitely a place to stop in to if you’re in town or from town. It’s authentic and it’s local! I love supporting local businesses and this one deserves the praise and support!",September 2019,El Rancho Grande,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60946-d1487726-Reviews-El_Rancho_Grande-Providence_Rhode_Island.html,"Providence, Rhode Island",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Absolutely Amazing Brunch,"We had scoped this location out for brunch a few days before actually stopping in. We were looking for a restaurant that offered great brunch and potentially some music. Although they didn’t have a DJ this particular Sunday we decided on going anyway because the reviews of the food were too convincing.

I am glad we didn’t choose another place. First, the decor is awesome! They did a great job with the place. It’s got a 90s hip hop feel with murals of classic artists in a few spots, additional graffiti throughout the establishment, and other decor that really remind you of the Biggie/Tupac days.

We were quickly seated and our server was great. She offered quick service and solid suggestions. I decided on an omelette with yucca fries on the side. My meal was absolutely amazing. Before ordering I wasn’t sure if I wanted French Toasts, but our server convinced me to get it for the table. That was a “game changer” move! The French Toasts were the best I’ve ever had, period! You don’t even need syrup ... seriously!

No one at the table complained about their food. Most comments were along the lines of “you’ve got to try this”, “it’s the best I’ve ever ...”, “this sauce though ...” ... needless to say, this place is A+ on the food quality and taste!

If you’re wondering where to grab brunch, Troop is the only place to consider. You won’t regret it!",September 2019,Troop PVD,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60946-d13145087-Reviews-Troop_PVD-Providence_Rhode_Island.html,"Providence, Rhode Island",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Great for Families with Young Kids,"Harvey is a great beach for families with young children. It’s a “small beach” until low tide. Most people come after 12p to take advantage of the wider beach. You can walk pretty far out without the water being deep.

If you get there before 9a, parking is free. I recommend it. It’s also a beach that’s pretty dog friendly. With that said, technically you aren’t supposed to bring dogs between May and October, but a lot of people do. There’s a sign about it, but they seem to be very lenient. Bring your dog at your own risk.",August 2019,Harvey's Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33878-d497992-Reviews-Harvey_s_Beach-Old_Saybrook_Connecticut.html,"Old Saybrook, Connecticut",attractions,4.0,4.0
Great Memorial,"If you’re in the area stop on over to the Mr. Rogers’ Memorial across from Heinz field. It’s located well with a great view of Point State Park, the incline, and cityscape.

The statue is a little terrifying at first, lol. However, the Memorial itself is beautiful. They’ve got a sound track playing with, I assume, his episodes on repeat.",August 2019,Mr. Rogers' Memorial Statue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g53449-d4112198-Reviews-Mr_Rogers_Memorial_Statue-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",attractions,4.0,4.0
A Must!,"Duquesne Incline is a must do if you’re visiting Pittsburgh. I’ll start off with the particulars. It’s $5 for a round trip and they take exact cash/change. A few people in line weren’t aware (me), but a nice couple behind me was willing to spot me and I paid them back via Venmo.

The trolly is OLD. It’s great to see it still running and in such great condition. The bottom of the incline is simply the location where you start. The ride up is great and the trolly is actually surprisingly quick. Once you get to the top make sure not to speed through the building. There’s actually a ton of history on Pittsburgh, the incline, and a gift shop. It’s nice to see all the pictures of Pittsburgh in its prime “steel city” days.

The best part awaits outside. Once you get out there you realize your $5 were well spent. You’ll get a panoramic view of Pittsburgh including well known buildings, Points State Park, Heinz Field, and PNC Park. I highly recommend it for the sunrise (depending on the time of year) and you can even get a good look of the sunset, but not as a backdrop to the city.",August 2019,Duquesne Incline,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g53449-d199154-Reviews-Duquesne_Incline-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",attractions,5.0,4.5
Visited For The Blue Slide,"I visited the park to check out the “Blue Slide”. It’s well known for Mac Miller, an artist from the area that passed away. It was great to see this little piece of history.

I didn’t expect the park to be so large. It’s got so many paths to walk, views of the city, and locations to take pictures.

I’d recommend it for a family outing, casual walk/run, pictures for wedding portraits or engagement pictures, etc.",August 2019,Frick Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g53449-d2233179-Reviews-Frick_Park-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great Park!,"Visited Point State Park 2-3 times while I was in town last week. It’s a large park with some history. It’s got a large amount of grass and saw a few people there playing dodgeball and kickball. There are paths to run/walk/ride on both sides. The paths ultimately lead to the large fountain. I saw some people BMXing, enjoying meals, and catching some views.

It’s a GREAT place to catch the sunset! You’ll have a good view of Washington Mountain, the incline, and Heinz Park.

I recommend visiting the park to hang out. It’s very relaxing.",August 2019,Point State Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g53449-d258386-Reviews-Point_State_Park-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",attractions,5.0,4.5
Clueless Staff,"The flight was fine and the seats were better than expected, but you’ve got clueless staff. I had a large backpack that was better suited for the overhead bin as it protruded out from the bottom of the seat. It was still within carry on requirements. I placed it in the overhead compartment and it contained my laptop and expensive camera equipment.

The staff wanted to move my bag underneath my seat to accommodate someone’s rolling carry on that arrived last minute for the flight? I told them I didn’t want my bag moved. If someone moved my bag later on the flight or slammed their bag against mine who was going to pay for the damage to my interior belongings?

I explained this to them and they insisted. I asked why she couldn’t just check her bag in and they said “because it would really help her out”. Well, sorry American Airlines staff, but that’s not the way it works out. She was late and we paid the same (I assume) for our tickets so why should her tardiness equal my inconvenience?

Retrain your staff! Overhead compartment is first come first serve. There’s absolutely no reason to inconvenience passengers that are already boarded because someone decided to arrive late.",August 2019,American Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729020-Reviews-American-Airlines,World,flights,2.0,3.0
Great Hotel & Room,"I’m in Pittsburgh for a week long conference. I leave tomorrow and wanted to provide a full review of my week stay.

The DoubleTree has been a great hotel. My particular room has a great view. I slept with the windows shades wide open every night because I loved the lights of the city. As soon as I walked in you could smell an amazing fragrance. I’m not sure what it is they spray, but it’s amazing! The room itself was very clean and spacious. There was plenty of room to open suitcases, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was pretty clean. Cleanliness in the bathroom was a 4/5 I’d say and the rest of the room was 5/5. That’s a much higher score than you can give most hotels. There’s a courtesy safe which I used everyday and an ironing board with an iron.

The hotel provides shuttle service in the downtown area only. I believe up to 5 miles from the hotel. It’s great for getting around! They won’t take you to PNC Park due to traffic which is completely understandable.

The hotel staff was great and when the AC unit stopped functioning they quickly remedied the situation. If you’re coming to Pittsburgh to catch a game, attend something at the convention center, or just visiting I highly recommend DoubleTree.

I’ve got no opinion on the parking since I didn’t park here. My advice is park early and leave your car if possible. The parking apparently sells out which is pretty common in any high traffic city.",August 2019,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Pittsburgh Downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g53449-d115503-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_Suites_Pittsburgh_Downtown-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",hotels,4.0,4.0
Great Location and Staff,"I visited the convention center for about a week while attending the SHARE event in August. I have nothing but great things to say about the convention center and the staff.

The convention center is beautiful. It’s high tech and they are currently doing improvements to their rooftop. The location has many outlooks where you can go outside and have your pick of many beautiful views. The views include the skyline, bridges, PNC Park, etc.

While attending, the staff catered to our every need. They were great helping us find rooms, restrooms, exits, etc. The staff also provided coffee, snacks, and a lunch. The food was delicious and the presentation was done well! Funny enough, one of the staff members took a picture of their presentation work. It was great to see how proud they are of their work.

If your company is looking for a place to hold its event in the Pittsburgh area or you’re attending any kind of event here you will love this place!

Tip: there are many places to walk around during breaks if you need it. There’s also many restaurants in walking distance to the convention center.",August 2019,David Lawrence Convention Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g53449-d1418699-Reviews-David_Lawrence_Convention_Center-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",attractions,5.0,4.0
Pretty Good,"I’ve been trying to eat light and/or moderately healthy while on my business trip in Pittsburgh. Anyone that travels often knows this can be difficult. I was looking for a place to eat just after 6:00p and only found Hello Bistro was open. It was surprising that most places close before 6:00p in downtown.

I got salad that is equivalent to a taco salad and substituted the chicken for shrimp. Once paid you receive a number if you’re eating in and they bring the salad over to you. It took a quick 5-8 minutes for them to prep the salad and bring it over.

The salad was tasty and lightweight. There was more than enough salad and I was full once finished. I wish the shrimp was “hot”, but it wasn’t a make or break.

The salad was a little pricier than I think it’s worth, but only by a $1-$2. I visited another local salad shop and the pricing seems to be about the same.

It’s well located, easy to get to, and the location was spacious and clean. It wasn’t busy when I arrived.",August 2019,Hello Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g53449-d8448281-Reviews-Hello_Bistro-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Beautiful View, Not A Bas Seat","I was in Pittsburgh for a tech conference and got to go to a Pirates v. Brewers game. It was a really close game, umpire provided some drama, and Pirates almost took the win. Nonetheless, it was a great time at the park.

This place doesn’t have a bad seat! The view of the game and the city are absolutely stunning. Even if you aren’t a pirates fan I recommend catching a game.

Ballpark food and drinks are expensive, but that’s like any professional ballpark. Make sure to stop and get a picture with the Roberto Clemente statue with his bridge as the backdrop!",August 2019,PNC Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g53449-d272117-Reviews-PNC_Park-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",attractions,5.0,5.0
