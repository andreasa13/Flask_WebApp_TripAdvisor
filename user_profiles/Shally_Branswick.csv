Breathtaking!,"Don't need to be an archaeology lover to appreciate this site. We were able to understand it better with our guidebook in hand. The 360 degree view is also fantastic, especially as it was a very good day with clear skies. Don't miss it but make sure to visit early in the morning as it can get really hot.",August 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

"Professional, informative and safe!","We booked several services (transfers and tours). Driver was always on time, very attentive and very infomative. The vehicle was spotless and all Covid protocols were followed. We were very satisfied with all services and would definitely use this company again.
