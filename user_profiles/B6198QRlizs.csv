I WANT TO RETIRE HERE,"I am in love with this place, I keep going back to the pictures to look at them, this place is amazing!!! We went in the middle of October, most of the spots were closed except for one where we sat, had whatever they had left at the bar because they were closing the next day and listened to Hotel California...I really did not want to leave that place. The water was still warm, it was 80 degrees, I have seen clear water in the Caribbean but I had never seen water that looks like glass. I will return, and hopefully retire and visit Potamos Beach every day.",October 2018,Potamos Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189473-d4788874-Reviews-Potamos_Beach-Thessaloniki_Thessaloniki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html,"Thessaloniki, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"No care at all to inconvenience caused to passengers when they cancel, or are late, etc.","The computers were down, they had us on the plane five hours with no air conditioning and nothing was offered to the passengers, no water, coffee, nothing. They had a miscount and had to go over the passenger lists manually, one woman had her service dog with her and after so many hours the dog had to go to the bathroom, they gave this poor senior citizen the hardest time and said if she left the plane she couldn't get back on. They called in the Police because people were starting to get verbal. So what do you expect when you're stuck in a tin can with no air, no water, and no answer as to when you're taking off. I will NEVER fly spirit airlines again.",August 2018,Spirit Airlines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729157-Reviews-Spirit-Airlines,World,flights,1.0,3.0
Great Pictures - Lots of Vendors - Lively Place,"This must be the hangout place for the young locals, it's always full and the majority of people there are either young Greek adults and tourists. You have the Parthenon in the background, great for pictures, and the metro is right there and Plaka where you can shop and look up and see the Parthenon. At night it's breathtaking!",October 2018,Monastiraki,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d265865-Reviews-Monastiraki-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.0
FUN,"Wonderful place to go walking in the evening. Full of people, fun area, I can't wait to go back!

Transported Back in Time,"There are no words to express what you feel when you reach the top and walk where people walked thousands of years ago. It's an amazing place to go once you get in, the lines are a bit long to buy the tickets but it's worth it. As far as the gate attendants, at least the two women that were there that day were HORRIBLE. In my case I had a medical condition when I was there and my daughters needed to accompany out, when we tried to get back in they wouldn't let us and this was AFTER we told them that there was a medical situation so if you are not feeling well and have a medical condition that may require you to go out the gate don't go because the ladies at the gate are nasty and have no sympathy.",October 2018,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Host Great Party's,"I've been here twice for parties and WOW, they know how to party. The food catering service is very tasty and the service is impeccable. Highly recommend it for special occasions and in the summertime when their pool is open, that's when they open their TikiBar.",January 2019,Soyuzivka Heritage Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g47994-d10827370-Reviews-Soyuzivka_Heritage_Center-Kerhonkson_Catskill_Region_New_York.html,"Kerhonkson, New York",hotels,5.0,4.0
Dinner with friends,"The title is ""Dinner with friends"" because that's how they made us feel, as if we were life long friends. It didn't feel like a restaurant, it felt like we were visiting someone. The food, it was fabulous!!!!

Very nice to be able to know the history.,"It was a simple stop, we were not planning it but it turned out to be very educational and nice. Very nice place to take kids and let them see what real work is, maybe they'll complain less to take out the garbage.",July 2018,Amish and Mennonite Heritage Center,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g50087-d2092234-Reviews-Amish_and_Mennonite_Heritage_Center-Berlin_Ohio.html,"Berlin, Ohio",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good Mexican Food,"It's home style cooking, service is very good, food is very good. It could be a bit spicier but I think they tone it down for those of us that are ""hot"" intolerant!",July 2018,Gaby's Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47676-d1218618-Reviews-Gaby_s_Cafe-Ellenville_Catskill_Region_New_York.html,"Ellenville, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
This is the place for Sunday brunch,"For the price of $17.00, you have a brunch that will definitely satisfy your palate. It's all spread out in a self-serve buffet, you can choose from traditional breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon, etc), or a more Southern-style breakfast with fried chicken and waffles made right in front of you, to fruits, cheeses, and if you're really hungry a slice of carved roast beef. I recommend you make reservations for a good seat, the view at any time of year of the Hudson River is spectacular.",November 2017,Shadows on the Hudson,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48443-d1574351-Reviews-Shadows_on_the_Hudson-Poughkeepsie_New_York.html,"Poughkeepsie, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.0
WONDERFUL BREWS AND THE FOOD ACCOMPANIES THEM WELL,"What can I say? How many places can you go where you drink a brew and then when you eat the taste and spices in the food compliments the taste of the brew? Not too many but this place achieved just that. They brew several different types of beer, I only tasted two the Pomme L'Orange, and The George, both were outstanding. We started with an appetizer and ordered the calamari and they prepare a dipping sauce with sriracha that is just WOW. My husband ordered their 16 oz. NY Strip and it was cooked to perfection just as he asked, and my skirt steak was perfect. I highly recommend it, it's very laid back, the place looks like an old log cabin/shack but it's actually very cozy and nice. Looking forward to going again.",August 2017,Rough Cut Brewing Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47994-d8384679-Reviews-Rough_Cut_Brewing_Company-Kerhonkson_Catskill_Region_New_York.html,"Kerhonkson, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
BISCUIT AND SAUSAGE GRAVY AND GRITS UP NORTH??? YEAP,"Well let me tell you, if you're from the South and you're missing a good bowl of nice grits, or some biscuits with sausage gravy this is the place to go. It's as close as you can get without being in the South. It's better than Cracker Barrel! If you're in the mood for pancakes...forget IHOP, there they have apple, banana, blueberry, strawberry, pancakes, oh mama mia, plan to unbuckle your pants when you walk out. The coffee is perfect, not too weak, not too strong but just right. The service is excellent, we've been there when they've had a full house and yet the waitress manages to constantly check up on us, that's incredible. I highly recommend this diner.",August 2017,Kerhonkson Diner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47994-d7248149-Reviews-Kerhonkson_Diner-Kerhonkson_Catskill_Region_New_York.html,"Kerhonkson, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.0
LIVE ENTERTAINMENT & PARTY TIME,"I visited there this past Saturday and loved it. We arrived around 9pm, there was a live group performing all the top dance songs, they were actually really, really good. Very nice mix, mostly between mid 20's to 60's. As the night progressed the band got better, they played a few songs from everyone's era (mostly 80's & 90's) and by the time I left at 2am the place was packed, I would have stayed if it were not for the fact that I had to catch a plane at 6am. Highly recommend this place if you want to hear good music, dance, and be in a place where people have manners.",August 2017,Blue Martini Kendall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34438-d7826863-Reviews-Blue_Martini_Kendall-Miami_Florida.html,"Miami, Florida",attractions,5.0,3.0

Friendly,"The service was excellent, the front desk attendant and staff were very attentive to our needs and comfort. The bed was extremely comfortable and it was meticulously cleaned. The one thing we did not like is that there are no drawers for your clothes away so we did the best we could with the furniture in the room. I liked that it's a no smoking building although they do provide a space for smoks.",December 2016,Riva Urban Lofts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312741-d3491032-Reviews-Riva_Urban_Lofts-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",hotels,5.0,4.0

Walk by the River,"Beautiful place to take a walk and take in the scenery. Many restaurants and bars so you can stop, eat, have a drink, and keep walking.
