Old Florida -- 1970 -- Great Lunch,Nice local place with good food and staff. Enjoyed a wonderful lunch from the outside upper bar overlooking the canal.,May 2021,Billy's Stone Crab,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34690-d395862-Reviews-Billy_s_Stone_Crab-Tierra_Verde_Florida.html,"Tierra Verde, Florida",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Wonderful Air-Boat Ride,"Our first air-boat ride. There were four of us and everyone enjoyed the trip. Great guide. Pleasant hour on the river. Great value at $45 per person. We saw alligators, bird life, and a beautiful river.

We would do this again.",April 2021,Up River Adventures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29172-d13543250-Reviews-Up_River_Adventures-Arcadia_Florida.html,"Arcadia, Florida",attractions,5.0,5.0
Inconsistant,"Excellent Cornbread Madelines ($6). Very good roasted carrots ($7). Jack Daniels BBQ Beans A++.

Sliced pastrami plate ($16) only OK, a bit too much fat (and yes, there should be some fat) that washed out the pastrami flavor. Ray's famous Italian Beef sandwich ($14) was good. Big Wedgie Salad was good ($14). Overall, the mains weren't memorable.

Dinner for four was $129.

Good service, but slow kitchen. Good atmosphere. Decent parking for downtown.",May 2021,Dr. BBQ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34607-d12455713-Reviews-Dr_BBQ-St_Petersburg_Florida.html,"St. Petersburg, Florida",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Excellent Modern Urban Park,"Excellent example of modern urban public park.

Lots of open space for walking and viewing. Restaurants, ice cream, and a small area of craft stalls. Adjacent to marina. Nice view of skylines and airport. Public art. Great splash pad for kids. Great playground. A small beach. Festive atmosphere. Fishing spot at the end of the pier. Nice small museum by Tampa Bay Watch.

A nice place to stroll, sit, and relax. A good spot to bring kids.

Clean. Shuttles. Parking is OK.

More cities should invest in public spaces such as this.",May 2021,St. Pete Pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34607-d21117923-Reviews-St_Pete_Pier-St_Petersburg_Florida.html,"St. Petersburg, Florida",attractions,5.0,4.0
Better than last time.,"We had dinner here - outside on the sidewalk. Enjoyed the food more than last time.

I had the Margharita Pizza ($14). Very good. Thin crust, but a little doughy. Also at the table Tagliatelle alle Bolognese ($17) served only warm, not hot from the kitchen. Also Ravioli al Formaggio -- very good ($19), and a Prosciutto Cotto Pizza with Arugula ($18). The Ricotta Meatballs (Meatballs, sauce, and little balls of ricotta cheese) was excellent ($11).

We all enjoyed the wine -- a bottle of ""Conundrum"" ($41), a red blend from California. We recommend.

Good service. Dinner for four $147. We will come back.",May 2021,Bavaro's Pizza Napoletana and Pastaria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34607-d10336789-Reviews-Bavaro_s_Pizza_Napoletana_and_Pastaria-St_Petersburg_Florida.html,"St. Petersburg, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Causal Outdoor Dinning -- Ok Food,"We had dinner here. The fish spread appetizer is very good. The rest of the meal was average at best. Probably a better place for drinks and an appetizer or two, than for dinner. Excellent location and atmosphere.

Slow kitchen. Long wait for food.

I had the chicken tenders sandwich (Island Time Dockwhich - $14) and fries. Boring.
We had the grilled street corn ($7.50) and was OK, but I think they boiled it first.

Service was average.

Plastic cups for beer and cocktails.

I won't rush back, but I might give it a second chance.",May 2021,Tiki Docks Skyway Bar + Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34607-d21142920-Reviews-Tiki_Docks_Skyway_Bar_Grill-St_Petersburg_Florida.html,"St. Petersburg, Florida",restaurants,3.0,3.0
Great Lunch Spot,"We had lunch here. Four people $112. Food was good, but not excellent or outstanding. However it exceeded expectations for a place with such a good view/location. High end pub food.

I had a Mojo Pork Sandwich ($11). Around the table was Fish Tacos ($14), Grouper Sandwich ($20), and Tropical Salad with Blacken Mahi ($23). Everyone satisfied.

Lightly battered or breaded french fries -- not my favorite.

Nice outdoor seating with great views. Live music. Good Service.

They serve drinks in plastic cups with plastic straws. I would prefer real glasses for look and feel, as well as environmental reasons. Use paper straws for the cocktails instead of plastic.

We will return.",April 2021,Doc Ford's Rum Bar & Grille - St. Pete,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34607-d21054591-Reviews-Doc_Ford_s_Rum_Bar_Grille_St_Pete-St_Petersburg_Florida.html,"St. Petersburg, Florida",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Nothing Special - Poor Value,"Rumfish is dated and worn. The hotel and grounds lack good flow and function. For instance, you walk to the Rumfish restaurant through parking garage traffic or backing delivery trucks -- no walkway. The path to beach front is down a dark hall or around the edge of the building on a narrow path between the wall and the fence.

Don't forget to figure in the extra $45/day activity fee when you price your room. Read careful what it includes and if you are actually going to use much of it. The things we tend use the most are free at a Holiday Inn Express -- towels, pool, WiFi, movies, exercise room, and such.

Mixed experience with the staff. Check-in (late at night) was excellent. Check-out at 8AM was awful --- one person at the desk with a line where some people needed 10 minutes of help and others only a minute. When we tried to ask at the office if we really needed to check-out in person we were barked at to get back in line. How about online check out????

Security theater at the front gate, and the night security officer was 350 pounds in a white shirt with a badge.

Mattress was uncomfortable. Sheets rough. Towels excellent. Room furnishings old. Marginally clean -- air vents full of dust, corners full dust, etc. Your typical Holiday Inn Express is 100% better for comfort and the condition of the room.

Free generic, unbranded coffee (as part of the $45 daily fee) in your room, or $4.50 coffee in the grill.

Cabana's come with the $45 fee, but the online system to reserve them doesn't work so your reservation isn't real. (Cabana staff says it hasn't worked for months.) You must physically present yourself the day before at 2PM to get a cabana. And, cabana's with a view of the water are $15 extra.

I won't go back. Not a good value. Failed to meet expectations. St. Pete Beach is great, but it is the same beach no matter which place you stay at.",April 2021,RumFish Beach Resort by TradeWinds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34606-d309575-Reviews-RumFish_Beach_Resort_by_TradeWinds-St_Pete_Beach_Florida.html,"St. Pete Beach, Florida",hotels,3.0,4.5
It felt different and slipping.....but still good seafood.,"We had fish sandwiches, an order of cole slaw, and two sodas ($38). It was slow getting our food and they weren't overly busy (empty tables inside and out). The fish was very good and we enjoyed our sandwiches. (But we thought they used to come with lettuce & tomato -- they don't.) The cole slaw was boring. The french fries not great, just OK.

You order at the window, pay, find a table and they call name.

Clean. Window staff very good.

Parking is tough -- we park at the Kittery Trading Post, walk over for lunch, and then shop at the Trading Post.",April 2021,Bob's Clam Hut,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g40699-d412965-Reviews-Bob_s_Clam_Hut-Kittery_Maine.html,"Kittery, Maine",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great Ice Cream & Hot Dogs,"We stopped for dinner & ice cream. We had Texas Hot Wieners ($2 each) with their ""secret sauce"" and Shoe String Fries ($3.25) each. Nicely done.

The ice cream was big winner. A small soft serve ($2.25) and a Regular Size Mint Sundae Special ($3.95) with mint chocolate chip ice cream, oreos, hot fudge, whipped cream, cherry and sprinkles.

Classic old school roadside ice cream joint. Excellent value.

And, they have Vegan Ice Cream and Shakes.

We will return.",April 2021,Mickey's Igloo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48003-d828309-Reviews-Mickey_s_Igloo-Kingston_Catskill_Region_New_York.html,"Kingston, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good Lunch -- Lots of Things to Lots of People,"I had a tuna melt ($10,50), a soda and chips for lunch. I've had coffee here in the past. Its fine for lunch and you won't be unhappy, but nothing special. The kitchen is slow for what they make.

They are covering a lot of bases here -- bakery, coffee shop, lunch stop, entertainment & events (story slam, open mic, music, etc.) --- so its hard to rate them across all their roles -- so I'm limiting my rating to stopping in for lunch.

Lots of outdoor dinning. Good COVID protocols and procedures.",April 2021,Taste Budd's Chocolate Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48473-d836026-Reviews-Taste_Budd_s_Chocolate_Cafe-Red_Hook_New_York.html,"Red Hook, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.5
"Great Sandwiches, Take-Out","I eat lunch here twice a week. They make excellent Sandwiches - made to order or from a list of standards. All Sandwiches are $9.50. They usually have two soups (or a chili). The buffalo mac & cheese is great. All the usual chips, sodas, and other drinks you would expect at a village store.

This is mostly a take-out restaurant. There are some picnic tables outside. They serve breakfast and lunch. You order at the counter and pay at the register. Plenty of parking.

They make a good breakfast sandwich -- English muffin, egg, cheese, and bacon.

Basic coffee -- no cappuccino or specialty items.

Friendly service.

Also serves as the Village convenience store for basic items.",November 2020,Old Village Store,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g41453-d208262-Reviews-Old_Village_Store-Barnstable_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html,"Barnstable, Massachusetts",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good Coffee House -- Good Lunch Spot,"We had lunch here. The food was good and you won't be disappointed. Pretty normal sandwich shop fare and breakfast fare that is well done. Full range of coffee items. Beats going to any of the chain restaurants.

I had a Rueben sandwich. It was average. Sandwiches are about $8 to $10.

Service was good.

Lots of space inside and lots of distance between tables. Outside seating also. You order and pay at the counter.

I would go back.",November 2020,Boston Bean House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41669-d4135079-Reviews-Boston_Bean_House-Maynard_Massachusetts.html,"Maynard, Massachusetts",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Coffee and Breakfast Sandwich,"We stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. We had coffee and breakfast sandwiches on a bagel. No cappuccino..... just regular coffees -- dark, medium & light. Good bagel -- it held up well as a breakfast sandwich (not soggy).

They are primarily a bakery, not a restaurant. You won't go wrong with coffee and pastry or a bagel for breakfast.

Pastries looked great.

Average pricing. Service a bit disjointed, but friendly and not too bad -- they could use an operations expert -- there layout and systems makes the staff bump about too much and overlap with each other.....",October 2020,Annabelle's Village Bake Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48473-d14051169-Reviews-Annabelle_s_Village_Bake_Shop-Red_Hook_New_York.html,"Red Hook, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Best of Fast Food Asian,"We had take-out diner. I had a rice bowl with pork and an egg. It is about $11. Lots of flavor to it and good ingredients. I would go back.

Good value -- filling.

Drive-up take-out only at the moment. Order online and drive up to the window at the appointed time.

They have a second location in New Paltz, but not part of a larger chain. A similar concept to Chipotle, but I liked it much better.",October 2020,Crazy Bowlz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g48003-d4850780-Reviews-Crazy_Bowlz-Kingston_Catskill_Region_New_York.html,"Kingston, New York",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Burritos,"We had lunch from Bubby's - a Brisket Burrito, a Chorizo Burrito & a Stand Burrito. We all enjoyed them and would return. The Stand Burrito is a traditional Burrito. Chorizo and Brisket made for a flavorful variation.

Burritos are $9 each.

Mostly a take-out place (and all take-out during the pandemic).

"Classic Fried Seafood, Outdoor Dockside Dinning","Excellent fried seafood. We pulled off I-95 and had lunch here. I had the whole clam roll, small onion rings and a root beer float. I would order this again. Plenty of clams. The batter is nicely done and not too greasy.

Your basic stand in line, order at the window seafood shack. Lots of outdoor seating, some under a pavilion. Nice view of the harbor and marina. Decent parking.

Lunch for two people was $47.36 (including a $5 tip).

There was a long line, but it moved reasonably fast, and the wait for your order was OK.

We would eat here again.",September 2020,Captain Scott's Lobster Dock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33852-d473772-Reviews-Captain_Scott_s_Lobster_Dock-New_London_Mystic_Country_Connecticut.html,"New London, Connecticut",restaurants,5.0,4.5
A Lot of Effort for A Coffee & Bagel,"We stopped (3 of us) for Coffee & Bagels. First we stood in line (inside) to pay, then we had to go outside to order the coffee, then back inside to a counter to order the bagels. We sat outside a table on the sidewalk. We had go back in to the counter to find our bagels. The coffee came out to us. We had to go back inside to dispose of trash....... all of this seems to be part of their COVID routine. Coffee & Bagels were fine. The price was right. Nice old market. Good selection of specialty items and basics. Maybe locals know the system.... the staff wasn't overly helpful and seemed annoyed at questions.",September 2020,Otto's Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47780-d2716138-Reviews-Otto_s_Market-Germantown_New_York.html,"Germantown, New York",restaurants,3.0,4.5
"Good Bourbon, Good Food Truck -- Overall Experience Lacking","The Flore Food Truck on-site was very good. The distillery was OK. There bourbon is very good.

They sell premixed drinks from a dispenser or you can buy them premixed in bottles. They are OK at best. Buy their bourbon and mix your own drinks.

We came at lunch time, we got drinks and a cheese/cracker plate from the distillery. We got lunch from the food truck. Outdoor dinning.

No real engagement from the staff.

I would buy their bourbon again and I would get take-out from the food truck again, but I don't think I'd go for the experience of drinking/dinning there again.",September 2020,Hudson Valley Distillers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g47780-d6924464-Reviews-Hudson_Valley_Distillers-Germantown_New_York.html,"Germantown, New York",attractions,3.0,4.5
Fun Way to Spend an Afternoon,"Did a tasting of three of their products -- two bourbons and one gin. Excellent products. The staff were knowledgeable, attentive and fun. We bought a bourbon and a gin for us, and we got maple bourbon for a friend.

We also purchased their Bourbon Maple Syrup, an item we've had before. Wonderful on pancakes.

Peaceful, pastoral setting. Lots of parking. Taste three items for $15. Small bags of chips available, but no food or snacks -- the only weakness.

Throw-Back to Another Era (1939)- Great Burgers,"Under New Management as of August 2020 & they seem to have preserved what everyone liked about the White Hut. Simple menu and good food.

We had lunch here. Burgers and Cheeseburgers with fries and onion rings. Burgers with fried onions is the signature dish and has been for the 50 or so years I've been coming. At the moment, the inside counter is closed, so its takeout or a few outside tables (we did takeout). The day we came, the milk shake machine was not in service.

Great service and value. Hamburger is $3.75, a cheeseburger is $4.00, and a hot dog is $3.75. Fries are $3 and onion rings $3.50.

The burgers are fried on a grill top with onions. They are very good. The fries are average. The onion rings above average.

The lounge area is a big round indoor fire pit with big comfy chairs. Plenty of beer on the tap. You can order drinks and food delivered to your bowling lane.

One weakness is the food. Its below average or barely average bar food. Ok for snacks and beer and bowling. The nachos are pretty good. The pizza is super thin and I'm guessing frozen/microwaved or something.

Easy Walks and Beautiful Views,"Easy, family friendly hiking/walking trails. Not as crowded as other sites in area. Beautiful ocean views. Meadows & wildflowers. Site of ancient Nauset Indian encampment -- now marked as ""Indian Rock"" - a grinding rock for making knives and arrowheads.

Two small parking lots off Fort Hill Road and some additional access at the town landing (Hemenway Road). Signage OK.

Also, check out the Penniman House near the first parking lot.

You can do a short walk of 15 to 20 minutes or spend two-hours here.

Excellent Spot for Coffee & Croissant,"I had coffee and a chocolate croissant for breakfast. It was as good as what I've experienced in France.

I sat outside at small table on the sidewalk. I'd put having coffee and a croissant here into the hidden-gem category. I wish I they were near my home! Note, all they serve is coffee and croissant, and of course chocolates which what they are really known for.

They are a small franchise.

I look forward to another visit.",March 2020,Schakolad Chocolate Factory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34607-d5209948-Reviews-Schakolad_Chocolate_Factory-St_Petersburg_Florida.html,"St. Petersburg, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Breakfast,"We had breakfast here. I had corned beef hash and eggs ($10). Very good. Good Value. It's a small locally owned restaurant. Very Good Service.

Its not on the beach, its right on Gulf Blvd across from the Plaza Beach Motel.

We we return.",March 2020,Sea Turtle Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34606-d8512475-Reviews-Sea_Turtle_Restaurant-St_Pete_Beach_Florida.html,"St. Pete Beach, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.5
"Fried & Grilled Seafood, Drinks, Loud","We were a group 14. This is a good place for large group. The seafood is better than you would expect in a place with large tables, a big bar, a large loud crowd, and on the beach.

I had the boiled seafood dinner -- shrimp, corn, potatoes, and french fries. Basic, but everything was done right. Others had fried Grouper and enjoyed it. Excellent Cesar Salad.

Mid-range price. Very good service.

We will return.",March 2020,Crabby Bill's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34316-d494848-Reviews-Crabby_Bill_s-Indian_Rocks_Beach_Florida.html,"Indian Rocks Beach, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Very Good Traditional Pizza,"We got six large pizzas for take-out. Two each of cheese, pepperoni, and vegetables. Good sauce and not so too much cheese (so as to overwhelm the other flavors). A traditional or typical dough and crust.

It's located in the Publix Plaza near the entrance to the Maximo Neighborhood.

Good service. $106 for all six pizzas.

We will go back.",March 2020,Portofino Italian Ristorante,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34607-d835785-Reviews-Portofino_Italian_Ristorante-St_Petersburg_Florida.html,"St. Petersburg, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Good Food - Weak Service,"This is at Tampa Airport. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Tots & a Soda. (About $8) I got a fried chicken sandwich instead. It wasn't what I wanted, but it was good -- in particular, the lettuce and tomato were fresh. The tots were average.

Service was a bit slow. Good value for airport food.",March 2020,PDQ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34678-d2444939-Reviews-PDQ-Tampa_Florida.html,"Tampa, Florida",restaurants,4.0,4.0
OK....Nothing Great --- Nothing Bad,"We had dinner here. I had a burger. It was average pub burger fare. Service was average. $60 for dinner & 4 drinks for 4 adults.

Service was average. Lots of parking.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but I won't resist it if someone wanted to go and get lunch or dinner here. It's comfy. It's Ok.",February 2020,Bobby Byrne's Pub,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41623-d384851-Reviews-Bobby_Byrne_s_Pub-Hyannis_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html,"Hyannis, Massachusetts",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Good Pub Food for Chain,"We had dinner here. It's a chain. Compared to chain restaurants I rate this above average, mainly on the strength of dinner. I had the Steak & Ale Pie ($14.99). It comes with cheddar mashed potatoes and vegetables. It's got flavor and its not too salty the way many commercial foods are. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, but no hint of cheddar.

Average to good value. Above average service. Lots of parking.

My experience with this chain is that the food is consistent from location to location.

Good Pub Food,"We had dinner here. Three pizzas shared by 4 adults. These are personal size pizzas (10"" - 11""). A pepperoni ($13), a fig & prosciutto ($15) and an onion & mushroom ($12). Not a traditional pizza style - a bit trendy, but very good. Lots of flavor -- nothing bland. Crust could have been more crisp.

Great atmosphere. Very good service. Average pub value (dinner & drinks for 4 $90).

Parking is difficult. We parked in town and walked up.

I would go back.",February 2020,1883 Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41753-d17599270-Reviews-1883_Lounge-Onset_Massachusetts.html,"Onset, Massachusetts",restaurants,4.0,4.5
View Beats the Food,"We had dinner here. I had Lobster Fra Diavolo ($38). Not great. The sauce was dull and soupy. The bluefish pate with our appetizer was excellent, the tempura was very good, and the salmon was dull. Overall, the meal wasn't good. Tourist food with a view --- you paying for the view.

Service was very good. The view/location is excellent. There was live music in the bar that was good. Without the music, the noise level in the restaurant is high. Good parking.

I didn't like the way the Lobster Fra Diavolo was prepared (in addition to the bad sauce) and presented. It is essentially a tight ball of linguini in a soup of tomato sauce with a boiled lobster on top. It also had clams in shell, mussels in shell, and shrimp with the tails on. A super mess to eat. To my mind, Lobster Fra Diavolo doesn't require you to pick your lobster meat from the shell dripping with tomato sauce. You should add the lobster meat to the sauce in the pan just before it is mixed with the linguini. The same for the other seafood items. I don't want to pick my shrimp out of the sauce to take the tails off. I want to eat the pasta, sauce, and lobster all as a single dish.

If someone invited me to join them for drinks and an appetizer to enjoy the view, I'd go. But, I'm not looking to come back for dinner.",February 2020,Fishermen's View,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41802-d10323094-Reviews-Fishermen_s_View-Sandwich_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html,"Sandwich, Massachusetts",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Wood Fired Pizza,"Wood fired pizza is their thing and its good, but not the best. Decent by Cape Cod standards. I found the crust to be a bit soft for wood fired. I had the sopressata pizza ($14.50). The sopressata was very good.

Six pizzas, wine and one appetizer was $138.

Service was above average.",February 2020,Pizza Barbone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g41623-d3296094-Reviews-Pizza_Barbone-Hyannis_Cape_Cod_Massachusetts.html,"Hyannis, Massachusetts",restaurants,3.0,4.5
It's OK,"I had lunch here. I had a small ""495 Wreck"" -- pastrami & corned beef sandwich. It was average. I had an order of fries (big enough for 2 or 3) and they were average.

The restaurant is in a strip mall space with plenty of parking and easy access to/from I-495 or RT 110.

Mixed Feelings -- Great Beer v Average Food,"I had dinner here with a large group. They make their own beer and do it well. The food is average pub food. Very good staff.

This a big loud place that's suitable for anyone. They are heavy into their own merchandising.

Clean & Comfortable,"I stayed one night. My room was clean & comfortable. This hotel follows the standard template of its class and does it well. The front desk staff was very good.

I didn't get a chance to try the breakfast because I left before it opened at 7AM on a Saturday. I think it opens at 6AM on weekdays.

Its All About the View.....,"A Five Star View and Two Star Experience. We came for drinks and appetizers. The drinks were OK (most drinks are -- its hard to get them too wrong), but the appetizers seemed commercial -- nothing great.

Service was OK. Pricey, you are paying for view and rooftop location.

If you are coming up for the view and a drink before diner, its fine.
