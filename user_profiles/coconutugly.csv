Never online!!!!!,"This is a pathetic service. My 2nd experience with a web purchase and i’m “paying the price”. I bought a bed base beginning on Feb, returned it on the same day.... no-one has come to collect AFTER NUMEROUS CALLS.... and end of March they want to charge me 300€ for the purchase!!!!. The 1st time was a cruise booking that went wrong. Never purchase on their website",March 2021,El Corte Inglés,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1207898-d10214678-Reviews-El_Corte_Ingles-Puerto_Banus_Marbella_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andaluci.html,"Puerto Banus, Spain",restaurants,1.0,4.0
Nice menu,"Nice menu and what helps is that they deliver. I did try their burger at last , and it was decent. I’d like to try their other dishes....",March 2021,Milk & Honey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1207898-d21229461-Reviews-Milk_Honey-Puerto_Banus_Marbella_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html,"Puerto Banus, Spain",restaurants,4.0,4.5
We’re burger mad!,"We’re burger mad. We’ve been trying to find the perfect burger in Marbella. I have my favorite, but this comes a close second. Very friendly staff, they’re quick and efficient and the place
Is clean. Also a fun atmosphere with quite a lot of customers!! Great to see. We have tried the Rome, London, NY and Berlin Burgers which have all been fresh and tasty. I LOVVVVE their dirty fries!",March 2021,Brödernas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g6940262-d21083642-Reviews-Brodernas-Nueva_Andalucia_Marbella_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html,"Nueva Andalucia, Spain",restaurants,5.0,4.5
The perfect house reef,"We’re avid snorkelers and probably place the importance of the house reef above all else ! Here we saw a ton of things... HUGGGE sharks, 3 of their “house” turtles, so many octopus that I lost count. Rays, scorpion fish, lion fish... the list goes on and on and on.... The beauty of Baros is that you can pretty much snorkel out at every point on the little island. We had an over the water villa with full on sun, but having seen their beach villas, I’d choose that next time. More privacy, prettier rooms, cool bathroom outside.... lots more shade and closer to the restaurants. I love the idea of our own “butler” (forget the term!?) Ours was Azzam who went above and beyond, to make us happy. I drove him crazy by changing the restaurant bookings all the time. He was so sweet. And so professional. Thanks!! The food was very good. They could do with an extra restaurant for lunch because the Lime menu, after a few days, was a tad tedious. The Lighthouse menu and food and staff were top. From here you gaze out at 2m sharks that seem to feed at
Night. The bar upstairs needs a facelift... its old 80’s .... with no atmosphere. The dive staff were fab, good excursions and activities on offer although we didn’t do any. The island layout is stunning,... the walkways in the “jungle” are super TOP. The reception and sails bar is soooo pretty. It’s old school chic. Not a lot of beach....
The only thing that needs attention (in my humble opinion) is their drab and old fashioned pool and sunloungers etc. HERE THEY COULD DO SOMETHING SERIOUSLY BEAUTIFUL... the pool is raised and no colour nor atmosphere around. Pool service is also bland. As a Small Luxuries Hotel, i feel they could do a slight refurbishment here and there... some things are starting to look old fashioned. Solid, yet old. Its a 20mins speedboat ride from Male and although the city lights are in the distance, it didn’t bother us, as it’s not in the flight path. You can also see factories burning stuff which was a bit of a downer. The visibility on the reef was good in the morning but slightly dirtier by afternoon. Again, we didn’t mind as we loved the 4km reef! On the whole, a top notch resort... which lives up to its name. I’d definitely return.",January 2021,Baros Maldives,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2104233-d316882-Reviews-Baros_Maldives-Baros_Island.html,Baros Island,hotels,5.0,5.0
Loved the 2m sharks,"Loved this restaurant. Loved the menu, friendly staff, and it was a nice break from eating at Lime every day. The bar upstairs needs a facelift though. Lovely part of the evening was watching a few MASSIVE sharks swim around.... apparently if you’re lucky loads of stingrays too.",January 2021,The Lighthouse Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2104233-d10716902-Reviews-The_Lighthouse_Restaurant-Baros_Island.html,Baros Island,restaurants,5.0,5.0
Best sushi and food ever!!,"We loved this restaurant. I could’ve eaten here every day. Loved the service, the menu, the stark interior.... and on the water. We had amazing pork belly starter 10/10 and the salmon main dish was incredible. This is their star restaurant!! Great menu incorporating new style modern japanese dishes",January 2021,Kanusan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g12219072-d11642014-Reviews-Kanusan-Kanufushi.html,Kanufushi,restaurants,5.0,4.5
