Fabulous lunch,"Booked as a treat after lockdown, had to book in August to get a weekend pod in September but well and truly worth the wait. Glorious day to sit in a pod on the side of a hill with fabulous sea views. Food was super scrumpy, best squid rings I have ever eaten and the lobster was well worth paying for. No complaints whatsoever, thoroughly enjoyable day out and would certainly recommend.",September 2020,The Lobster Pod Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1526073-d15049087-Reviews-The_Lobster_Pod_Bistro-Hope_Cove_Salcombe_Devon_England.html,"Hope Cove, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Enormous swordfish,"We ate dinner here two nights ago and it was delicious, the swordfish was enormous and twice the size of any I have ever eaten in the UK.

Fabulous view over Athens,"A fabulous day out, take the funicular to the top and then amble back down. The most beautiful little church at the top with the most awesome views over Athens.

Afternoon Tea,"Absolutely delicious afternoon cream tea, lashings of cream and jam, best scones I have ever tasted, crumbly on the outside and soft inside.

Excellent value for money,"Iceland is very expensive so if you are looking to go on a budget then this is the hotel for you. Very clean but very basic, small rooms with no mod cons except wifi. Staff extremely friendly and very helpful and as breakfast was included you certainly could not argue. If you are looking to spend time in your room then this is not the hotel for you but if you just want somewhere to sleep after a day out and about it really is good value for money and considering they offer salad, two soups and a hot choice for your evening meal at a reasonable charge, again if you are not a fussy eater, a good deal. However, if you want a city centre location be aware this hotel is a 20 minute walk away but there is a lovely view from the 6th floor.",January 2017,Hotel Cabin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189970-d234325-Reviews-Hotel_Cabin-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",hotels,5.0,3.5
If it is good enough for Rick Stein then it's good enough for me,"Well, after seeing Rick Stein eat there we had to try it. Struggled to locate in the first instance but google maps came to our rescue. Small queue but moved quickly enough. Not elegant dining, school dinner table dining, but food is excellent. Tried lobster soup, delicious and also tusk skewers (cod like fish) which was the deal of the day and have to say it was delicious. Not brave enough to try whale but each to their own but would certainly recommend for a different dining experience. Excellent value for money.",January 2017,Saegreifinn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189970-d1209708-Reviews-Saegreifinn-Reykjavik_Capital_Region.html,"Reykjavik, Iceland",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Awesome Faberge Eggs,"Wow. Impossible to put into words just how amazing the exhibits in the museum are. You are able to wander around, take as many pictures as you like, either rent the audio guide or make use of the free guide books (loaned and need to be returned at the end of your visit). Staff were so incredibly helpful one even ordered a taxi for us so we could return to our hotel.

Fabulous break,Booked as a Groupon deal so unsure what to expect but absolutely faultless. Cannot comment on all the rooms as we upgraded and had a great view over St Michaels Mount although the meal in the dining room and the awesome cocktails at happy hour did mean we did not stay in our room much! Staff incredibly helpful and friendly and nothing to much trouble.

October 2015,"Sunday lunch was taken here. The most amazing experience, made more special due to the fact that we should have gone in March but due to my partner suddenly being rushed into hospital we had to put our trip on hold. So looking forward to it and it certainly did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived it was completely faultless, the guide was funny and informative and whilst I would not have chosen the meal we had it was absolutely delicious and just proves sometimes it is good to move away from your comfort zone.",October 2015,Spitbank Fort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186298-d3410738-Reviews-Spitbank_Fort-Portsmouth_Hampshire_England.html,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5

Skylon Tower Dinner,"The best way to spend 90 minutes eating. The views are awesome and the food was absolutely fab, from the moment you step into the lift on the side of the building the journey just gets better and better. A bit of a queue once inside but well worth the wait and the food in the restaurant is delicious. Could not fault the whole experience and even brought my souvenir glass as a reminder for when I got back home.

afternoon tea,Delightful venue for afternoon tea. Delicious sandwiches and truly mouth watering cakes. Would not hesitate to recommend and if there was a downside it was the wasps...

Afternoon tea with free flowing bubbles,"Unfortunately arrived 45 mins late as we drove up from Devon and traffic was solid with a 4 hour journey taking 6 and a half hours so raced into the library late and a very stressed party of four. What can I say other than fabulous. Window seat we had requested had been saved for us and the staff were extremely welcoming, could not fault the staff, the food or the setting and to finish of the afternoon because we had arrived late and could not enjoy all the time we had booked we were taken into the bar area and our glasses refilled again. Well worth every penny and would recommend without hesitation. Just wish I could name our waiter as he was faultless.",June 2015,London Marriott Hotel County Hall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d195225-Reviews-London_Marriott_Hotel_County_Hall-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Afternoon Tea,"One word sums up a great day. ""Perfection"" from the moment we were greeted on arrival it really was a fabulous experience with the most delicious sponge cake I have ever eaten. We arrived early but this was not a problem, sat outside in the sunshine and had a truly leisurely afternoon tea with attentive staff and gluten free cakes not a problem. Day was rounded off with a lovely walk around the grounds.
