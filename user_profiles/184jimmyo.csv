Unbelievable,"Travelled from Naples to Pompei by taxi. This place was very calm peaceful but very sad, the work done here and which is still on going is amazing. An experince never to be forgotten. Travelled onto Sorrento , the cost of the trip was €250 For 4 persons as we wanted to leave, otherwise €50 per person ,(total 6 persons) we got deal from Milo +39 3396043476 ( I called him Robert de Nero) very nice pleasent driver , we spent 2hours at Pompei and 1hr 40mins st Sorrento, ""this was our choice"" Milo would have stayed linger if we wanted.",September 2018,Pompeii Archaeological Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187786-d195477-Reviews-Pompeii_Archaeological_Park-Pompeii_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html,"Pompeii, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Tickets hop on hop of buses,"Just back from visit to Rome, 21/09/2018 , decided to spent 3 days in Rome after our cruise. Weather was very warm and humid ( yipee) , we had decided that it was best to buy tickets for the hop on hop of buses to see as much as we could in the 3 days. Wanted tickets to Vatican, Sistine chapel, and Collosseo. Clearly stating these were a must , paid €82 each for the Green bus at a ticket shop on the street near stop 4 of the green bus route. We did a full lap of the city to see where evetything was and planned our route. Were told our tickets to the vatican and Sistine Chapel were valid till 3.30pm each day and Collosseo till 4.30pm . Were not told we had to validate our tickets to get in from shops in these places but reassured that tickets we had for Collosseo were ok and would get us in, ( totally not true ??? Couldn't understand why these people could not tell us the truth), were not allowed in the Vatican at all ( arrived at 11.25 , told to come back at 1pm.) Had skip the queues also, the queues were very long as there was thousands of people there which made the skip the queues long also. Inside the Sistine Chapels it was extremely warm and humid, you have to wear clothes covering your shoulders and knees , took too long to get around the Sistine Chapels forcing us to cancel the Collosseo till the next day as it was near 4 o clock before we got there and were too hungry ( lol) and thirsty. Visited Collosseo next only to be told we had to walk all the way around to a shop to validate our tickets again to a set time.... in between our main sites of interedt we wanted to see the Trevi fountains, beautiful, stopped to have a cool beer in a cafe, and asked a waiter after we were finished and paid up directions but were abruptly brushed of by him , gobsmacked is putting it mildly, took €17 For 2 beer of us and was the rudest person you could hope to meet?? For me the sites are a once in a lifetime experience, but ""some"" of the people who are involved that I have encountered in variest ways and jobs need reminding that the bubble could burst because of their manners. We had a lovely Taxi driver who took us from Naples to Sorrento his name was Milo, I called him Robert De Nero +39 3396043476 ,really informative, and curtious to our needs.. City Of Rome I'm afraid was a disappointment, could not believe how bad the footpaths and roads were around our hotel and how unclean it appeared . The roads are cobbled in most places and in poor condition, scooter bikes are huge and are everywhere , zipping in and out at daredevil levels ,(scary) Our Hotel was exactly as we expected, loved it, quiet and very clean with good air conditioning, lovely staff too, Hotel Villa San Pio ( some photos below ). For Irish tourists try Fiddlers Elbow bar, magners served ,lol €5 day time with owner Franco (below) and €6 at night.",September 2018,Hop On Hop-off Bus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190409-d3474359-Reviews-Hop_On_Hop_off_Bus-Monte_Carlo.html,"Monte-Carlo, Monaco",attractions,3.0,4.0
Eastern Mediterranean Cruise on Jewel Of The Seas 09/09/2018,"Amazing Cruise....
Didn't get of to the best start after we flew into Ciampino airport. We were traveling by train. Caught the bus from airport (Atral) at bay 4 (€1.20 each) to Ciampino station. Bought tickets at machines (€5.60 each) which was a connecting train,change over at Termini Station, which was where our troubles started, found some staff members to be very unhelpful ,very rude to be more precise. Directed to platform 1 and then correctly redirected to platform 26 causing us to miss our train , having to wait over 1 hour for next one even thought stated there was another one before it???? On arrival at civitavecchia station approached by taxi driver but when we told him to boat port he waved us away ??? Walked towards ships we could see ported and asked bus drivers inside port which one was Jewel of the seas and got shrugged shoulders except to wait for shuttle bus which never came??? Walked to an entrance and was directed to another bus stop which eventually brought us to the ships shuttle buses , leaving us only 30 minutes to spare, not good and left a very bad impression on us as to the Italian way of treating holiday makers in need of guidance.... But once we were on the Ship it was amazing , the staff were absolutely brilliant in every department and we soon forgot our woes, loved every minute of our stay on board and met some fantastic people from many different countries ,and will be sailing to new destinations for sure in the future. Thank you to all the Jewel of The Seas crew for making it a holiday to remember. The cabins were brilliant, we had an oceanview 3136 , kept clean everyday. Food was endless and varied . Entertainment was 1st class . Especially my best new friend ""Charlie"" from Jacksonville who gave me a six pack from laughing, ""Beer"" lol and his lovely wife Fran xxx Till next time xxx",September 2018,Share a Shore Excursion in Italy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g194743-d1972274-Reviews-Share_a_Shore_Excursion_in_Italy-Civitavecchia_Province_of_Rome_Lazio.html,"Civitavecchia, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
Mid week break,"Stayed here 10 years ago on a stag weekend, didn't remember much . Stayed 2 nights at s fantastic Valve B+B rate, on arrival was met by a very polite Male receptionist who booked us in very quickly and guided us to the hotel bar for tea and biscuits... dined in hotel that night and can say the meal we received was absolutely delicious ( rack of lamb and lamb shank) had a few beers at the bar and was happily served and chatted to by ""Ger"" the barman ..top man.. also service at breakfasts was educationally as was given lovely advice on walks and areas to go to by waitress. Room was spacious and catered for all our needs, bed was super size and very comfortable. Westport was very quite but was getting ready for paddy's weekend.Was a lovely fresh 2 days stay and would recommend Clew bay Hotel for value and location. Thank you to all who made this a warm and relaxing stay for us...",March 2017,Clew Bay Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186627-d212615-Reviews-Clew_Bay_Hotel-Westport_County_Mayo_Western_Ireland.html,"Westport, Ireland",hotels,5.0,4.5
beutiful Dubrovnic Croatia,"Stayed at Hotel Vis from 03/06/16 - 10/06/16. transfer by taxi was 300 kunas ( 7 kunas to €1 ) about €40 one way. Were met at the steps by porter who helped with the bags and was pleasant, steps down to hotels entrance about 2 flights . Receptionist was polite , there was typing error on their side but was resolved later on. We went to hotel outdoor resturaunt and met with big smile by waiter. View was overlooking the pebble beach which was beautiful, but beach could do with some TLC . Sun loungers were 35 kunas each per day . but had no mattresses, we ordered local beer and a side snack, have to admit Croatia beer is the best ive met on my travels so far. We went back to check in and were allotted our room 212, a standard double, was on the small side but very clean, there was a very small balcony only holding 2 plastic chairs, didn't matter as we don't spend much time in room, only to sleep. The hotel Vis is in the Lapad region and only a stroll downhill to the shops and diners and very few bars, sport is very popular on Tv's.. The average price for a main course ranged from,, 120-180 kunas , this does not include drink or starters or desserts. Water is best bought in local shop as it ranges up to 30 kunas in resturaunts , ( about €4) Found a little Bar called THE IRISH BELFAST BAR and this was the cheapest drink in the whole area coming in at 20 kunas a pint, and the staff were very very friendly, myself and my beautiful wife settled here as we had been going since 1am that morning, On buying our 3rd drink we were not charged and this seemed to be a pattern, any time we returned we always got a smile and a free drink, have to say it was a pleasant surprise. This is a smoking bar as are most of the resturaunts, We strolled back to the hotel and fell into our very large double bed , very comfortable too, room had air conditioning which i set as temps were rising. B+B is the basic package, we like to dine out, breakfast was continental and was very suffice considering the price we paid . On return we discovered the cleaners had been in, and this was the pattern everyday , absolutely brilliant workers in this hotel. The dining staffing are constantly clearing tables and the staff are middle aged who as we inquired one worked there for over 34 years. These hotels close in winter by the way... Off to the old town we went, deciding to walk, took about 50 minutes over a very hilly terrain, water in local shop a must till u get to old town where you can fill up bottle for free from fountain in square. The old Town with it's surrounding walls is a sight for sore eyes, stunning. To view surrounding area from these walls is 120 kunas each. loads of museims to see each have a cover charge . At the end of the town there is a harbour , with various boat trips to islands or Cavtat town , 110 kunas for 50 minute trip to cavtat return, last boat at 5.30pm . There is a Cable car ride nearby, can be accessed from old town costing 110 kunas return, stunning viewes of the old town ,harbour and some islands. The Gaffe Irish Bar is just off the main street in the old town, and even has Guiness ( not like home ) but makes a good photo, they also serve food , steak not too bad . The No.4 bus stops directly outside Hotel Vis and Uvala which is a sister hotel to Vis. You can use the Spa and wellingness centre in Uvala which has 2 pools, one indoor and one outdoor, bubble baths, showers , lockers , sun loungers with mattresses and 2 towels given for 50 kunas, and use of the poolside bar and resturaunt with beautiful views of the bay. All transactions are paid with a reciept given. There are loads of cats in the area , all are clean, look thin compared to Irish cats ,but are not overly hungry. On check out there is a government tax of €1 per day per person. Really enjoyed my stay, the hotel staff are very efficient of which i thank them .. loved my little Irish Celtic Belfast Bar and it's staff , 2 of the girls even had dyed red hair lol many many thanks Croatia... hope some of this information is helpful , Dubrovnik has a lot of steps in the old town and no lifts if access to the wall top is sought ...",June 2016,Hotel Vis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295371-d304338-Reviews-Hotel_Vis-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",hotels,3.0,3.0
A Must Do,"Stunning views , lots and lots of steps , walking impediments not advised, 110 kunas is the price to access the walls, you can see the work that is still under way as you walk along. it Takes about 40/50 minutes stroll the approx 2 km round trip .",June 2016,Walls of Dubrovnik,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295371-d522915-Reviews-Walls_of_Dubrovnik-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beauty to the eye,"The ride on the cable car can be acessed just outside the old town, it costs 110 kunas per person return. it is a very quick ride only taking a couple of minutes, there is a lovely dinner at the top with stunning views of the old town and surrounding area. There is a musieum and access to buggy cars outside the cable area, For the more energetic person you can walk up or down to this area, have no idea how long that would take,",June 2016,Dubrovnik Cable Car,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295371-d1886448-Reviews-Dubrovnik_Cable_Car-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",attractions,5.0,4.5
Andro Arkulin,"Hired a taxi at the airport as wanted direct travel to hotel. Inquired how much fare would be for the 27km journey and was told 300 kunas ( approx €40+) .Had a very informative Taxi Driver by the name of Andro Arkulin .So we booked him for the return trip also. He had a different driver pick us up on our return, who was a very very pleasant man who even gave us a small guided tour of an area devastated in the 1991 aggression on Croatia. It is about a 30 minute trip with breathe taking views as you arrive in the Dubrovnik region.",June 2016,Dubrovnik Tours & Transfers by Vidokrug,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295371-d6537543-Reviews-Dubrovnik_Tours_Transfers_by_Vidokrug-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",attractions,5.0,4.5
