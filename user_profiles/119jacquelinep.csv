Very good!,"We had a couple of hours to kill before heading to the airport and decided to go to the museum.

Also, great view of Acropolis from inside the museum and free WIFI.",September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Great view!,My husband and I only stayed for a night but enjoyed the lovely view of Castello del Moro. Small but cute balcony. Concierge was very helpful. Cute restaurant nearby named Plane. Breakfast was a typical European breakfast. Eggs weren’t very good but food was plentiful.

Fantastic View!,"My husband and I stayed at the petite suite. Incredible views of Oia, with blue and white domes. The hot tub was very nice as well. The breakfast was enormous a d delicious! With scrambled eggs, yogurt, pancakes, fruits, croissants, chocolate and vanilla pound cake, orange juice, milk, jam, cereal and coffee. We could barely finish. There was a leak on our first day but they were very quick to fix it. My only suggestion is that they rope off your stairs as we had Instagramers wander onto our patio tub area to take pictures. Also, note, the patio is viewable to the public as there is a viewing point above.",October 2019,The Dream Villas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482941-d12347043-Reviews-The_Dream_Villas-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Breath taking,I absolutely loved the Acropolis and personally never grew tired of it. The highlight of our trip! My husband and I love ruins so we thoroughly enjoyed it. I was a fan of all the cats too.

Amazing view and location!,"We stayed in the room with the Acropolis view and jacuzzi. Our room was at the top floor and was roped off. Can you just say VIP service?!? We never tired of the view and the staff was simply amazing. Aris, out concierge, was so funny too. The breakfast was delicious. We had robes and slippers and daily housekeeping. They are situated in a very charming little street with shops and restaurants in Plaka. We have since departed to Santorini, Heraklion and Chania and still compare everyplace to this. They set the bar high!

Great stay with our dog!,"We were greeted like stars every day! The room was clean, beds were very comfy (pillow top?), room was soundproof, which our dog really appreciated during thunderstorms. They provided water, tea and coffee and fruits downstairs. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the pillows but I have neck issues and brought my own. I would definitely stay here again!",July 2019,Le Meridien Philadelphia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60795-d1479774-Reviews-Le_Meridien_Philadelphia-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",hotels,5.0,4.0
Good for the money,"It was a great price. Room was clean, staff was very helpful and friendly. No true ocean view. Breakfast was good. Pool was very nice. We loved seeing the monkeys from the pool. They also provide drink service by the pool which is a nice touch. AC was rare in the area so we were very happy to have it.",September 2018,Hotel Cuna Del Angel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g313829-d797038-Reviews-Hotel_Cuna_Del_Angel-Dominical_Province_of_Puntarenas.html,"Dominical, Costa Rica",hotels,3.0,4.5
Horrible Customer Service,I contacted the hotel and Orbitz a few minutes after booking in order to cancel. Orbitz mentioned they would fully refund me if the hotel agreed. The hotel agreed to cancel and mentioned Orbitz would have a fee but they would be happy to cancel. I told Orbitz they agreed. Orbitz reached out to the hotel on several occasions to confirm and they never picked up the phone or returned their messages. I never received a refund.,January 2018,Hotel Casa Blanca Boutique 506,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g309293-d13083890-Reviews-Hotel_Casa_Blanca_Boutique_506-San_Jose_San_Jose_Metro_Province_of_San_Jose.html,"San Jose, Costa Rica",hotels,1.0,3.0
Great hotel near the city,"Just 5 minutes away from the city center! The bus is right across the street and concierge conveniently sells the tickets for them The staff was extremely helpful.

Amazing room and food,"Our reservation was lost but they upgraded us to a suite for the trouble. All is forgiven!! We had panoramic views of the lake and stayed in the largest hotel room we've ever seen. The room was extremely large and had two rooms along with a terrace. The food included the best lamb and homemade cheesecake we've ever had. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. They even spoke English. Quiet, zen like hotel and surrounding. The best stay during our trip, hands down.",September 2017,Hotel Kriunes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1093088-d1886743-Reviews-Hotel_Kriunes-Kopavogur_Capital_Region.html,"Kopavogur, Iceland",hotels,5.0,4.5

Best Tour for Northern Lights,"Boy am I glad I booked this tour for the Northern Lights! After tracking the aurora borealis on 2 different apps, I decided on booking with this company due to the vehicle. The jeeps are equipped with the largest wheels I've ever seen, enabling them to go farther and higher than most cars. They took us to the most remote places to get closer to the lights. What we saw that night, was beyond our expectations. The forecast was a 6 and the amazing display of lights took our breath away.

Excellent service!,"We were in Nuuk for 3 days and decided to book a tour on the 1st day. All tours were booked, including this one. However, since they knew we were leaving in a couple of days, they were kind enough to book us a private boat fjord tour after their regular business hours. They were so very accommodating and offered life suits to place over our winter gear. They also provided tea to warm us up. This tour was like being inside a painting. The beauty we witnessed was insane.",September 2017,Boat Tour to the Fiords,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g295112-d12868360-Boat_Tour_to_the_Fiords-Nuuk_Sermersooq_Municipality.html,"Nuuk, Greenland",activities,5.0,5.0

"Great location, nice room","We were close to all the monuments, Capital Hill and the White House. We walked everywhere. The hotel is located in the Financial district so a lot of places are closed on the weekend. Very friendly staff and very nice room. Ask for a room viewing the street if staying on a Thursday night. Otherwise, you will end up waking up in the middle of the night during trash pick up. All other nights are quiet. They do provide ear plugs just in case. Free bike rental and lemon water.",September 2016,Hotel RL Washington DC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g28970-d84080-Reviews-Hotel_RL_Washington_DC-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",hotels,4.0,4.0
