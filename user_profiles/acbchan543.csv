Poor communication on delay information,"The flight was delayed 30 min, then 30 min, then another 30 min, and 30 min more. We were wondering if the flight was going to take off at all. We asked the counter, and the lady was impatient to answer my inquiry. I even got a text message on my iphone and told me to consider rebooking with no detail. And the airline offered no compensation at all.",December 2019,Delta Air Lines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729060-Reviews-Delta-Air-Lines,World,flights,3.0,4.0
Definitely worth visiting if you are interested in history,"A tour guide will make the visit much more meaningful since history is so rich in this place. Reading poster descriptions could be another option, but not as thorough and interesting. Even the view itself is magnificent and impressive. Going there early is an advantage to avoid the crowd since this is such a popular place.",November 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Maybe a better hotel around the same area,"The location is excellent. The beach is right across the street. There are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Each room seems to have a small balcony for guests to sit outside and see the street and the water (or part of the water if not from an oceanfront room). Our two rooms are spacious. That said, I did not find their hotel environment attractive. Have been in many Marriotts with nicer settings. Parking is expensive ($45/day), and there is an additional charge of $35/day/room. Some minor points: they don't provide hotel slippers and there is no water in the room (have to go downstairs to get it from the water supply station). There is a small pot to make coffee or tea available, but one cup only. Must wait for the device to cool down to make a second cup.",December 2019,Marriott Hotel Waikiki Beach Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60982-d214683-Reviews-Marriott_Hotel_Waikiki_Beach_Resort_Spa-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html,"Oahu, Hawaii",hotels,3.0,4.0
A calm and spiritually attractive place,"Although not a large place, it gives visitors a sense of calmness and peace. I met one or two older clergymen doing daily chores there, and they were very friendly. The place is well kept. I particularly like the little garden with variety of flowers. If in the neighborhood, the monastery is well worth a visit.",November 2019,Krusedol Monastery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304079-d550447-Reviews-Krusedol_Monastery-Fruska_Gora_National_Park_Vojvodina.html,"Fruska Gora National Park, Serbia",attractions,4.0,4.5
One of the good airlines we have ever flown!,Both the land crew and the flight attendants were polite and helpful. The planes were clean. The food was good. Both flights were on time.

Must visit,This place is different from many other museums. I call it a monument in memory of many freedom fighters in Ireland. It embeds a page of human history with many sad stories. Listening to the description from the tour guide will make your blood boil and fill your eyes with tears.,November 2019,Kilmainham Gaol Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d191025-Reviews-Kilmainham_Gaol_Museum-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Small but neat place to visit,"This two-floor building houses a large variety of animal, fish, bird, and insect models and specimen. It is particularly suitable for children. There is a post at the entrance, ""If you are free, we are free too.""",November 2019,National Museum of Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d191021-Reviews-National_Museum_of_Ireland-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.0
A good and convenient way to see the city,"Most efficient way to see the city. There are 31 stops in the bus loop, which allows us to visit many locations along the way. Tour buses run frequently and we do need to wait too long at any stops. Narration is available at different languages. Senior folks even get discount on ticket fare.",November 2019,City Sightseeing Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186605-d11739272-Reviews-City_Sightseeing_Dublin-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",attractions,5.0,4.5
Definitely an attraction of the city,"Although the renovation has not completed, the outside looks magnificent. The basement is opened to the public. It is large and beautifully decorated.

I took the day trip,"Max M, who stationed inside the Fortress park, gave us a very clear explanation on what to expect from the boat ride. We appreciated his patience and was attracted to this activity. He suggested we should take the day trip instead of the night trip so that we could see the city better. Turned out it was a popular ride and the boat was full.",October 2019,Danube River,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294472-d536399-Reviews-Danube_River-Belgrade.html,"Belgrade, Serbia",attractions,4.0,4.5

Didn't get much from my Northern Serbia tour,"It's convenient to be picked up from the hotel, and the ride was smooth. That's the best I can say about the trip. Did not learn much about the points we visited because our guide said little. I did not learn anything about Novi Sad since we were left in a square to walk around by ourselves after we got there. This is disappointing especially.",October 2019,"Northern Serbia, Sremski Karlovci, and Novi Sad Full-Day Tour from Belgrade",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g294472-d11992558-Northern_Serbia_Sremski_Karlovci_and_Novi_Sad_Full_Day_Tour_from_Belgrade-Belgrade.html,"Belgrade, Serbia",activities,2.0,5.0
Good location for Sydney visit,This hotel is right in the center of activities. Many are within walking distance. The hotel is clean and staffs are helpful and courteous. The only thing is it is a touch on the expensive side; perhaps this is because we come in the peak of travelling season.,November 2017,Amora Hotel Jamison Sydney,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255060-d284258-Reviews-Amora_Hotel_Jamison_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",hotels,4.0,4.5
Definitely worth the visit,"We joint the 1-hour guided tour instead of the 30 min one, and we were very happy about it. We learned a lot about this renown architecture - the history, the operation, and a lot of detail about the building that we would never know if not because of the tour.

That is a nice church to visit,"For some leisure walk and do not want to lock yourself up in the hotel room, coming to Hyde Park is a good way to spend your time on a sunny warm day. In it, you will find this magnificent cathedral. A good place to say a little prayer for a happy vacation. Even if not a Catholic, one still enjoy the calm atmosphere and take a little rest after strolling under the sun for a while. But this is not the place to find something stunning.",November 2017,St. Mary's Cathedral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d256719-Reviews-St_Mary_s_Cathedral-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,4.0,4.5

"Nice garden with ample space, free admission",It is adjacent to the Opera House. We killed two birds in one stone by confirming our guided tour time for the Opera House and used the time in between to see this garden. It is a huge area to cover within a short time. The alternative is to ride the Choo Choo Express to see more with limited time. Can buy the train ticket near the Opera House.,November 2017,The Opera House to the Botanic Gardens Walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255060-d556175-Reviews-The_Opera_House_to_the_Botanic_Gardens_Walk-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",attractions,5.0,4.5
