Most Romantic honeymoon destination,"Stay at Santorini

We chose to stay in Firostefani ,as being the center of city, everything was within the reach.In firostefani we stayed at Sunset Hotel, the experience of staying over the caldera is once a lifetime for sure.Location wise it is the best place to stay within budget.

Room cost was 114 Euro per day in mid November which further reduced to 92 Euros in late November.

Day 1
Since we visited in November,weather was quite unpredictable. So the day we reached, it was raining heavily and weather turned out to be pretty cold.
We took our raincoats and decided to explore Fira on foot. Walk from Firostefani to Fira was about 2kms. Due to heavy wind ,weather turned out to be really cold. It was hard to find vegetarian food in Fira, only thing we could had in budget was Pizza and soft drink.

Day 2

Oia has world’s best sunsets so the plan for day was to hike Fira to Oia. Entire hike is of approx 10 kms and takes upto 2.5 to 3 hours. Its advisable to start early as by 10 am because you can avoid mid afternoon heat. November was the best time to hike because weather was favourable compared to Hot summers of Sanotrini. Don’t forget you camera , some of the most scenic landscapes and seascapes will stretch before you .

Red rock beach,"Beach is really worth visiting . Rocks here are red in color. You have to hike a bit to reach the beach. When i visited there were warning sign boards of rock slipping so its advisable to watch the beach from distance rather than going down.

Kamla Nehru Park/Hanging Garden,"Recently I have been searching some place to visit with my family in Mumbai . Since I was done with all famous places so was looking for something left unexplored.
So decided to check out Kamla Nehru Park and Hanging Garden at Malabar Hills. I was knowing about this place but wasn't sure if its that worth a visit.

HOW TO REACH-

I travelled Kamla Nehru Park from Malad. The nearest station for Hanging garden is charni road. From there we hired the taxi which costed around 60 Rs. Taxi will drop exactly at the gate of the Garden.

It took us one hour to reach Charni road from Malad west.And then another 30 mins from station to Hanging Garden.

Right in front of the Hanging Garden we have Kamla nehru park with famous Boot house. Which is pretty interesting I must say but only kids below 12 years are allowed to enter into the house..which is sad :(",April 2019,Kamala Nehru Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304554-d324635-Reviews-Kamala_Nehru_Park-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,"Mumbai, India",attractions,4.0,4.0
