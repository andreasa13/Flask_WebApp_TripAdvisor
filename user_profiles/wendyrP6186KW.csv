Delete this museum!!,This “museum” is on a run down deserted street and is closed up. Phone doesn’t work. Don’t waste your time!!,March 2021,Classic Cars International Antique Auto Museum of Utah,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60922-d272257-Reviews-Classic_Cars_International_Antique_Auto_Museum_of_Utah-Salt_Lake_City_Utah.html,"Salt Lake City, Utah",attractions,1.0,3.5
Acropolis is amazing!!,"We went to the side entrance right when they opened, no line to get in. A combo ticket gets you into the forum and other sites, well worth extra charge. A guide came up and said $20 per person if we wanted a tour. We had group of 4, best money we spent. Anastasia was her name, she was a phenominal guide. Going up the back side you start with the theater and the Odeon before going up to the acropolis. A must do when in Athens.",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Highly recommend this tour...,"We enjoyed this tour, and had the hotel pick up which was really nice. I will try to use this feature in the future as much as possible. It was a nice mini-bus and a small group. Great sites, and the guide was very good at relaying the history to us. Seeing these sights were very meaningful to us as Christians.",October 2019,Ancient Corinth and Daphni Monastery Half-Day Tour from Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d11895982-Ancient_Corinth_and_Daphni_Monastery_Half_Day_Tour_from_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,4.0,5.0
Highlights tour!,"We had Valentina as our guide, and she was very friendly and knowledgeable. We left right on time, and the skip the line was nice. Of course you still have to wait for security once in, as there are other groups that are also skipping the line, common sense. It doesn't take long, they move you through quickly. Once inside she moved us through to most important pieces and explained them, why they are important, and a bit about the artist. My husband really appreciated this as he is not into museums, but he enjoyed her presentation of the info and liked the speed and length of the tour. Would definitely recommend!",October 2019,Florence in 4 Hours: Skip the Line David & Uffizi Express Group or Private Tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187895-d13365683-Florence_in_4_Hours_Skip_the_Line_David_Uffizi_Express_Group_or_Private_Tour-Flore.html,"Florence, Italy",activities,5.0,4.5
Tuscany is a must see!,"We had Eleza as our guide, and Nando was our driver from Walkabout Florence tours. They were both great! Eleza was so friendly, and she spoke very good English so no struggle to understand. She gave us information about the area and history, and we saw a beautiful winery and organic farm. We ate lunch at the farm, and had wine tastings. What a beautiful setting, I want to come back already. Only thing that could make the day better would be more time at each village location.",October 2019,Tuscany in One Day Sightseeing Tour from Florence,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187895-d11450566-Tuscany_in_One_Day_Sightseeing_Tour_from_Florence-Florence_Tuscany.html,"Florence, Italy",activities,5.0,5.0
