Recommended!,"Excellent tasty greek meals and friendly and brisk service. The waitress helped me to choose the proper food for my low carb diet. HUGE portions of fresh vegetable salads, grilled veg was better for me. Reasonable prices. It s a spacey place so, don t be deterred, even if it is not full of people, don t hasitate and go",October 2019,Tsi Tsi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g562630-d4841416-Reviews-Tsi_Tsi-Glyfada_Attica.html,"Glyfada, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Breathtaking experience,Amazing. Just few people there and almost tangible genius loci. Restaurants and cafes very close the place. I didnt have enough time to search throught the whole ancient area but even then you can see a lot of ancient ruins and beautiful forests around.,October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Nothing special,I dropped in for lunch and was looking forward to sea food. The grilled octopus I took was not what expected. Very salty and not very tasty as well as the grilled vegetable. Also loud music there with speakers by almost each table. Prices a bit higher than standard. There are better places nearby worth spending such money.,October 2019,Kotili,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2340576-Reviews-Kotili-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Warmly reccomendedðŸ˜Ž,"I have nothing to complain. The room is clean and cosy and people here very nice and helpful. The highway just next to the place is busy night and day, though. Then sensitive individuals should take it into consideration. Personally I prefer quiet places, but even then I was perfectly satisfied.",October 2019,Minavra Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562633-d662594-Reviews-Minavra_Hotel-Voula_East_Attica_Region_Attica.html,"Voula, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.0
