Worst airline ever,"We had to fly on June 3rd We bought a ticket 2 weeks before we fly from Milan bergamo to Tirana Albania ,4 days before the day we fly we received an email from the company saying they're sorry but the flight is cancelled...... seemed like there were never going to be a flight but they make people buy tickets anyway...... they then ask you to keep the credit in your wizzair account to use it for future flights. Soooo it's a trick and a trap to keep your money..... to call them from Where we lived cost so much..... so this airline loses some customers......for future flights....... no matter how cheap they are in the future I will never ever buy another ticket from wizz air....... the only time ..the most crucial time in my life that I needed them ...they disappointed and made me angry..... not because a flight just got canceled.... but because they tricked their customers into buying a fake ticket that would never take place...... I guess it worked this time.... but never again.....",May 2020,Wizz Air,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729187-Reviews-Wizz-Air,World,flights,1.0,3.0

The truth of this restaurant.,"When it first started I was very pleased to eat here because the food was very good and the price was lower than now.

Seems like it's getting worse , I would say to the management to take a good look at the restaurant section and try every dish ... if they find nothing wrong with the food then they need to look for a new job.

Waiter was very rude.,I don't understand why in Athens the restaurants and cafes still hire old school waiters.... ordered our drinks then when waiter brings them over he asks to get paid because his shift was over . Weird because when we paid him he put the money in his pocket and never left. We never got a receipt he just verbally said the amount. What made it worse was that he kept his eyes on our table.... wasn't sure if his goal was to make us leave soon or? We thought he pocketed the money without the boss knowing about it.
