More than just the Parthenon,The Acropolis is the hill. The Parthenon is the biggest building at the top. But there are several buildings up there and they are all interesting in their own way. Be sure to stop by Athena's olive tree and get a pic. [It's not the original tree but don't let that ruin the moment.],February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Just go,"There are very few places as important to western civilization as the Acropolis and Parthenon. The walk up to the top has stairs and some steep spots, but it's worth it. Visit the Acropolis Museum first, then hike up the hill.",February 2020,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Very interesting - great background info,"We were encouraged by several guides to visit this museum before heading up to the Parthenon. That recommendation was spot on.

By visiting the museum, you can see both original pieces from the Acropolis as well as reproductions of large bits of the Parthenon that were either destroyed or spirited off to England a couple of centuries ago. Having this context makes your visit up the Acropolis that much more rewarding.",February 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Sunday morning - arrive early,"The changing of the guard is fun. But even in February the crowd was quite large and arriving at 10:30 is much too late to get a great view. We did ok for viewing but arrive closer to 10:00 if you want to really be able to see and take unobstructed pictures.

The guard change happens every hour, though with much less fanfare. Go to one of those before the Sunday morning change, just to get a sense of what they do. Sorry, no music during those other changes - that's Sunday 11:00 only.",February 2020,Changing of the Guard Ceremony,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d12064411-Reviews-Changing_of_the_Guard_Ceremony-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
