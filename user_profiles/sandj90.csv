Another fantastic meal,"Went with friends for Sunday lunch. All had the roast. Three pork and one beef. Once again the meal was excellent as were the puddings. Got as busy as social distancing would allow. Hope the pub gets through these difficult times as there are too many closing down at the moment. The beer garden is great, very neat and tidy with plenty of tables and on a sunny day would be great to sit there and have a beer. Long may it continue. I am related but by no means has this influenced my opinion.",August 2020,The Crown Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g652382-d4757380-Reviews-The_Crown_Inn-Shepton_Mallet_Somerset_England.html,"Shepton Mallet, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
With friends,Took friends for Sunday carvery. Great Yorkshire puddings. Excellent meal. The desert was to die for. Very friendly guy behind the carvery deck.( I have to say he is my nephew) but this hasn't influenced my review. If it wasn't good I'd have written nothing. Good selection of beer as well. Enjoyed it immensely.,September 2019,The Crown Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g652382-d4757380-Reviews-The_Crown_Inn-Shepton_Mallet_Somerset_England.html,"Shepton Mallet, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
So good we went back,"Had a couple of meals in other restaurants close to our hotel. The meal we had in Gods Restaurant was so good we went back on our last night. It wasn't a fluke, the next meal was as good if not better. The waiters were very friendly and we were made very welcome. After our second visit we felt like family.

Very different Sunday,"Went with friends in a group of six. Apprehensive at first even more so when we saw the venue. Don't be put off. Did the Hotel Hostage. Very amusing and clever. Got us all working together and we managed to get out in 45 minutes......with help and a clue. A very different, but amusing way to spend an hour or so on a Sunday.

Fantastic pub,"Six of us went for lunch after 'City Maze' experience. We were a bit early but were made welcome and a table was soon sorted for us. All had roast dinners. Great food, great puddings, great atmosphere, good range of drinks, friendly staff. Fantastic pub with a happy ambiance and very busy. The toilets were spotless which is always a good sign.

Terrible,"Visited our local Wetherspoons for lunch today with visiting family, we have used this pub chain all around the country and have to say our ""local"" is the worst we have been in. We ordered lunch for six of us and were advised of a 30 minute wait, after 40 minutes we checked on the progress of our order, 5 minutes later the one starter ordered arrived but the waitress walked away with cutlery in hand, after a further wait we checked on the main courses again only to be told that the Hog Dog wasn't available, so we re-ordered and waited again. Finally the food arrived most of it was cold apart from the ""cooked"" cucumber in the salad side. Clearly this had been sat under a hot lamp, after complaining once again we were offered free desserts. It wasn't especially busy, we have seen it much busier and sadly have had this problem once before in The Lantokay, there wont be a third time.",November 2014,The Lantokay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g780820-d3672538-Reviews-The_Lantokay-Street_Somerset_England.html,"Street, United Kingdom",restaurants,1.0,3.5
