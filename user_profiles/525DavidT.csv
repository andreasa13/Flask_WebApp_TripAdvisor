We dined as a group of 6.

I had the special, got the last one, 1/2 lobster mornay with chips & salad as I really struggle with the menu as many of the offer dishes we have had are not the best.
The lobster cooked well, the salad mostly lettuce & very bland.

"Sensational, Fantastic, Much more than we expected. A must do.","We thought the Abrolhos islands consist of 4 islands, one inhabited with old fishing shacks, How wrong were we.

The Abrolhos group consist of 4 cluster of islands protected by reefs, totaling 122 islands.

You must remember WA's west coast is the windy coast so each tour will vary depending on the weather.

We scored 3 perfect sensational days (very lucky) so we packed so much in.

Fantastic snorkeling, equipment supplied, If you do not snorkel there is a glass bottom boat option, they have two, so plenty of room.

Eco walks on several islands with an very knowledgeable specialized guide .

A visit to one of the habited islands.

Every day the opportunity to do an early morning lobster pot pull & fishing (6.30am). Over our trip we pulled over 220 crayfish & caught plenty of excellent fish.

On one night you fish off the back of the boat, fantastic the night we were there you could literally walk across the water as it was covered with bait fish, amongst the fish enjoying a meal were 4 bronze whalers, 2 Dolphins & a seal all competing for the bait fish that we were also catching. What a special night.

We had a new chef on board & boy does he now how to cook. What a great variety of lovely food & yes of cause plenty of Crayfish (lobsters) & he even had time to fit in a beautiful Birthday cake for a guest celebrating his birthday. What a nice touch

The crew, well every single of them were so accommodating & friendly we felt part of a large family. Certainly would recommend this adventure.

There is the option to fly back to the mainland instead of the 6 - 8 hour boat trip.

We took this option it certainly was the quicker better option but it would have been nice if the plain flew over the group of islands & commenting on sites like the Batavia wreck which was eluded to being part of the flight.

1 calamari, large packet frozen rings commercial product but was a very tender & a generous serve, if you ask they will honestly tell you if it is fresh or frozen.

1 pork ribs excellent , tender & tasty.

2 Family pizza 1 satay chicken & 1 Vegetarian both absolutely lovely.

The only two things that put me off a little was a board outside says Food Fired Pizza's, they need to remove the board as they use commercial ovens, the wood fired oven was sealed up & has not been used for some time.

You really need to book the right room & make sure you get that room.,"We booked through Bookings.com a pool view room, the hotel deducted our charges well in advance

On arrival we went to our room near the pool BUT our only view was a brick wall no balcony or external table & chairs.

With paperwork in hand we spoke to the desk only to be told that our booking was made through a third party & we have no control over what the offer. ""WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH"" The hotels place their offers into the third part site. Unfortunately the pool view rooms were all booked so we stayed were we where.

This is a large complex with many different room offerings so please choose you room carefully.

The front of the complex is your typical drive in motel complex with only driveway & car parking views.

The rear has a loop road around the rooms & large central Pool not all rooms here have pool views.

Our room was large & well appointed looked like the photo's obviously recently refurbished. Could not complain about the actual room, only no view.

The site has several swimming pools, inside & out, a mini tennis court, mini golf & kids play area, the motel was very popular with families.

We also book the full breakfast both mornings, $19.90, continental $15.90.

A unique experience,"Do not expect a hotel. Think a concentration camp layout. Yes it is a unique experience.

You arrive at the top gate, visitors open car park / reception.

After check in a van takes you to your block. The vans are available at call, allow 20 minutes to shuttle you around the massive grounds & to the front gate.

The rooms vary depending on your booking but please remember it was an old Quarantine station that is slowly being upgrades.

Our queen room with bathroom was compact but that was the quarantine room sizes but they have since added bathrooms.

Note some rooms have attached bathrooms external to your room.

Rooms have a fridge , coffee tea facilities , toiletries. Tv , ours suffered from regular stoppages. Some rooms have harbor views but not all we were lucky.

The breakfast was at the end of our block but for others they had to walk.

The variety for breakfast was cereals fruit & yoghurt. Variety of toasts. tea, coffee.
A changing variety of 6 heated items, tomato/ hash browns or button mushrooms /bacon rashes( quite fatty)/sausages(not very nice) / Baked beans / Scrambled eggs.

breakfast starts at 7 am. On the first morning we arrived at 7.30. the food was lukewarm, on the second morning we arrived at 7am to get HOT food, that did not work as the food was just warm & the baked beans & grilled tomato cold.

We chose to eat at their award winning restaurant one night but cancelled as the menu was a set menu of about 5 Entrees / 5 mains / 5 desserts.
Minimum 2 course $65 or 3 course $80. We cancelled for several reasons after seeing the menu,
1) we really struggled to find something we liked, Maybe the Wagyu steak with fries & salsa verde ???? not really fine dining, we went into Manly and had the Wagyu steak medium with chips, vegetables, Red wine jus , well cook, yummy $28 at the local pub.
2) it was totally overpriced for the offer.
3) we really only want 1 main eat.

Finally we must say we visited the 1st full week of opening After covid & the cleaning standards especially on the verandahs did not exists. Looking at the 4 & 5's as visitations pick up we can only assume there standards do.

Well they must have a new cook.,"Give this place a miss.

We ordered Pad Thai with seafood, $20.90. first it was no where near a pad thai it was more like a thin noddle stir fry , we could not eat it. seafood consisted of 2 prawns, 2 pieces of calamari 6 small shelled mussels obviously all from the freezer well over cooked.

BBQ beel, small serving, very overcooked tough beef & again, not nice at all lacking flavour.

Chicken red curry which tasted very nice but again chicken was tough.

We were so looking forward going back.,"This was one of our favourite thai restaurants, not anymore.

We struggled with the menu, finally choosing the grilled lemon chicken, a grilled chicken breast, it came sliced on a plate in a small amount of sauce with a lettuce leaf & slice of tomato. Very average we left some.

The chefs suggestion Sizzling seafood plate, 2 mussels, 2 prawns , 2 scallops, 2 small pieces of fish, 4 tough pieces of calamari In a onion & carrot spicy sauce. It was spicy & tasty.

We were left disappointed & this is our 4th & last visit.

Nice meals but a little pricey for a club. The use of the word seafood a little misleading.,"When you see the word seafood & Grill it conjures up the thoughts of an array of lovely prawns , oysters, bugs , lobsters etc. This is not the case at all yes they do have meals that have fish etc but that's it.

Unfortunately some quests left early as one of the lifts were out which left long waits for the other or you could use the stairs 11 floors in total.

We stayed over new year which is a little pricey, breakfast extra which they offer for $20 when checking in,normally $30, should be included. Not worth it. That is our opinion & the opinion of other guests, food lukewarm even cold ,we only ate there one morning.

Parking offered for $25.

You really need to pick the right weather.,"The boathouse does have some indoor protected seating but the majority of the seating is external under a large roof with the sides open to the elements.

On the day we went is was windy & cold, yes they did put the heaters on after we asked but would not put the side curtains down, we guess its because it would have been to load with the wind blowing.

The restaurant was full, we booked a table for 8.

We ordered 3 child meals, two chicken nuggets & chips & one fish & chips, all good servings.

We also ordered an adult fish & chips, again a large serving of chips with two battered fish & salad.

We also ordered the seafood platter for 2 which 4 adults shared.
It had 6 large prawns, 6 oysters, 4 scallops, 2 large pieces of battered fish 1 crab, battered calamari, grilled octopus & copious amounts of chips.

We also ordered 2 different salads & they gave us a complimentary one.

We could not eat everything & should have dropped the adult fish & chips.

Yes they are big serves, packed full of chips. We found the batter they used on the fish & calamari unpleasant.

The also only have 1 combined bathroom for all their guests.

Absolutely beautiful Business class,"We flew two separate legs, Athens to Doha & Doha to Sydney.

Athen business lounge they us Swiss port, it is a small quiet lounge, minimal very average food & drink selection.It did not rate for us.

The flight Athens to Doha was in a std flat bed business, very comfortable & very good cabin crew.

Doha business lounge is very large with a few sleeping areas, you really need to be quick to get these. We were there for 11 hrs due to our original flight being moved& missed out on a sleeping room.

There are several snacking areas down stairs & a very good eating lounge upstairs,

The flight Doha to Sydney we had what could be called semi private seat/sleeping areas very nice. Good food selection, open eating times & excellent staff.

Whilst being assured that all selections would be available, we only ordered our breakfast & left our diner selection to later, when it came to ordering, the steak was no longer available.

Lovey beachside view,"We went to this taverna as our hotel staff had recommended. We both had the fillet steak. Whilst it was seasoned well, it was over cooked and a little tough. Not what we would call a true fillet cut. Staff are very friendly and service was good. We also felt the marinated anchovies were overpriced, and salty. We have had same portion serve at other tavernas for half the price and better flavour. As the taverna is open to the elements it is not good on windy days.

On our last day of our 3 month Greek holiday we walked past & took a look at their menu, we are now very wary of the Greek menus as the final dish rarely looks like the picture, NOT here, what you see is what you get.

Yes it is a little bit pricy to some of the other restaurants nearby, one in particular pricy restaurant nearby, we sent the food back & left. But the food here is excellent.

For lunch we each had a serving of fresh oysters , beautiful , & shared the Aubergine stuffed with veal, it was very very nice.

For diner we had the tuna tartar, again lovely.

My wife had the crusted lamb rack which she really enjoyed & I had the pork tenderloin with pepper sauce which I really enjoyed.

The staff are very friendly & helpful.

We really enjoyed our 6 night stay,"We originally booked a standard room but wanted to pay to upgrade to a suite for our last 6 nights of our 3 month Greek honeymoon.

They did everything possible to accomodate us, we ended up staying 5 nights in a suite due to cancelations & one night in a std room.

On arrival they had a platter in our room & offered a bottle of sparkling for our honeymoon , a very nice considerable thought.

The suites are very nice with a good size bedroom, lounge room with sliding doors and partition to seperate both. Nice bathroom. With two balconies overlooking the port area.

The std rooms are just that, nice bathroom & compact bedroom.

All have a stocked minibar with finally, very sensible prices, well done.

All the staff are extremely friendly & helpful.

The location in old town on the waterfront is fantastic . Walking distance to many attractions and restaurants.

We ate our breakfast out on the boardwalk but you can eat inside if you wish

The breakfast offered is extremely good with many options.
On the first morning I got to fried eggs that were just put in the warming trays, they were stone cold??? From then on I asked for two hot fried eggs & it was never an issue, each morning I was even asked if I wanted my eggs as usual. That's friendly service.

I found the Internet a little slow at times but you could look up most things but I could not load photos to Facebook or get into my email account, problem solved, just go to any of the restaurants close by & use theirs which worked perfectly.
On the last day in the side std rooms, it also works well.

They also provide a few bikes free of charge for quests use.",July 2019,Porto Veneziano Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189415-d227375-Reviews-Porto_Veneziano_Hotel-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Do not go on Wednesday or Friday.,"We Believe entry to the whole area should be closed on Wednesday & Friday as you can not enter the Monestry on those days, yet they are happy to take your 2.50 euro , same entry fee as Monestry of Triada.

Our rating can only be done without seeing the Monestry.

After walking past the closed Monestry , you open a gate & start your 30 minute descend down a rough stone pathway, as you descend on the other side of the valley there is what looks like a lovely old building reasonably in tact which appears to also be built into the mountain, unfortunately the path does not lead there.

You finally end up in a ruin, behind is a cave which looks like an old large bath inside, near the entry is to tiny rooms made out to be small churches.

The path then wonders further, a group of your girls came up so we asked what was down there, they replied a path to nowhere so do not waste your time, so we ascended the cliff.

They also don not allow photos or videos. Understandably in the Monestry however taking of photos on your journey to the cave we cannot see why.

We both ordered medium veal/rump steak, it normally comes with chips & rice.
My wife asked for chips only & the mushroom gravy on the side.

I had the medium rump, chips & vegs with mushroom gravy.

When they arrived, they were both cooked medium with perfect crossed scorch marks but pale meat colour ??????!

Both had chips & salad ( tomato cucumber & lettuce) the gravy on mine did not quite mix with the salad. I actually asked for vegetables.

The steaks were a little tough & chewy. The mushroom gravy was lovely with large slices of mushroom.

You can only get bottle or glass wine here, it a shame as most house wines in Greece are nice.

They are destroying their own business,"We went to the restaurant about 1 pm on a Wednesday, apart from the family & friends chatting loudly & playing bat gammon. We were the only customers.

We sat & waited for them to stop chatting & bring a menu.

There was a reasonable extensive menu & the prices were cheap.

We noticed a lot of asterisks which indicated frozen product.

There promotional board promoted BBQ/Grill

My wife chose the fried calamari. It was tender but oily.

I wanted the BBQ meat, or steak, sorry none of the BBQ was available.

I then asked about the frozen pizza, is it made here or manufactured packaged, it was the last. She then proceeded to go through the menu telling me what was available, out of all the seafood, one item, yes manufactured, in fact on 40% of the menu was available. Stews salads & manufactured frozen items.

I felt like leaving but we were hungry, settled to a Greek salad, basically tomato, cucumber , slice of feta 5 olives .

As we were finishing a family of 3 arrived. They sat then she stared at the family until they brought them a menu & set their table.

The one dish we noticed being delivered was a Greek salad which she took back , had words with the staff & returned with a lot more extra's.

Yes it is cheap, calamari, Greek salad, 1/2 ltr wine, 1 500 ml mythos beer, 20 euro.

They really need to change their approach & supply a menu they can deliver & not serve frozen manufactured products.

When I was rudely interupetted by a male ( whose duty is to ensure photos are not taken) I Was told to leave . I said to the person I am still praying and I will be finished in a minute. He then persisted in telling me I must leave. I said I will leave when I have finished my last pray. Is this Christanity?

"Stay away, look at the food being delivered before you choose this restaurant.","We were looking for a good steak, whilst the steaks are not cheap, we do not mind paying for a good meal.

I ordered the 12 hour slow cooked beef ribs, the one being the main photo on the trip advisor page. 24.80 euro.

My wife wanted the rump, the waiter told us the rump delivered this morning was tough, so it was not available, finally after 3 months in Greece, an honest waiter so we order the veal fillet steak with sauce on the side 27.80 euro.

After our experience we guess it was not available because they certainly not worried about quality.

Well our 500ml mythos beer 5 euro & our 500 ml rose arrived, an hour later our drinks were finished our meals finally arrived. Whilst waiting we noticed numerous people arrive, order, mainly pizza , eat & leave.

We started to suspect something was wrong as 12 hour slow cooked ribs would be ready to serve& a good thick medium steak, 9 minutes at best.????????

Our obersevation the pizza's we say delivered were overcooked & burnt, we noticed people struggling to cut them with a knife & fork, a family next to us arrived much later. on leaving here pizza just arrived so I asked her what the pizza was like as she seemed interested when we sent our meals back , she replied ""it wa rock hard"".

My 12 hour slow cooked ribs looked nothing like the photo, there were two very lean small ribs which were tough slow cooked I don't think so. Serving was very small and not a portioned to price. After I tried to cut the ribs I tasted the mash (which was lukewarm being genourous)

My with specifically asked for the sauce on the side, it came with sauce all over the meal we asked for it to be returned , we also said we did not want the same fillet back
as the last time that happened they took it back, scrapped the sauce off & heated it up serving an overcooked tough steak.

We asked for our bill not wanting anything else and being the first time in 3 months we sent both meals back & did not pay for them, when our bill arrived, the soda was overcharged. We paid for our drinks & left totally disappointed.

Great BBQ on a Sunday,"We visited the lovely lake side village of Kournas on a Sunday by accident on our way to Chania. What a great find with all the restaurants along the lake. Most served a BBQ ( meat on a spit) Sunday lunch.

After looking at all the restaurants we chose this one as it seamed to have a lot more meat cooking than the others & a greater variety. They had lamb on racks near coals in one outdoor large oven the most popular dish. On the spit over coals they had an offal dish obvious a very popular local dish, on the other was pork & chicken.

We were going to have the lamb, pork & chicken but was talked out of it from the waiter as it would be too much, he was right, we had the lamb & pork, both served with chips, we changed one to salad.

Rimondi is two different hotels adjacent to each other,"When you look at at their night photo's there appears to be one large hotel, when in fact what you see are two hotels, but not realising it as they are located across a lane way from each other. This confused us when booking & we actually chose a room that did not really suit us.

Both hotels share the same reception & kitchen.

Generally all the staff are very helpful & friendly with the exception of one gentleman on reception was very snappy when asking about the water policy, that being 2 free small bottles during your stay, not to each day like a lot of othe hotels we stayed in during our 13 weeks in Greece.

The one we stayed in is Polazza Rimondi, it has a compact pool in the courtyard where breakfast is served. The other being Rimondi estate.

On arriving we noticed the pool in our hotel looked untidy with leaves in it, during our stay that did not change much except we did see it cleaned on on Occassion, there was also a piece of electrical wire laying across the entry, they could be a little tidier.

The breakfast has a good coverage breads, cakes & pastries, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, whole, diced & sliced. Sliced meats, trout, cheese etc. They have several hot dishes, always scambled eggs, lightly cooked bacon & mini frankfurts, mixed pies. The rotate between baked beans & grilled veggies. I found the baked beans & scrambled eggs nice and warm but the rest generally cold or Luke warm.

We chose a Duplex Palazzo, obvious now it is a tri level in the Polazzo hotel.
On entry you have a little bar area (good size mini fridge with coffee/ tea glasses etc, the mini bar is also stocked. The compact bathroom is also on this level.

Down 3 steps, a lounge area with wardrobe & small low table. This is where you stow your clothes.

From the entry you also go up a narrow staircase to the tight bedroom whith an impracticle writing table and stool situated under a stair well, when you stand up you hit your head. There is also a good size balcony overlooking the pool courtyard area. We did not use it as the two aircon motors are situated here, making it noisy & hot due to the heat output of the motors.

We found it uncomfortable going down the stairs at night & also to get changed or dressed.

As we said we just chose the wrong type of room.",July 2019,Palazzo Rimondi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189421-d494024-Reviews-Palazzo_Rimondi-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5

We started with the marinated fresh anchovies , the anchovies are deboned served with a little olive oil and fresh herbs , lovely.

I had the chicken wings with BBQ sauce, you get 10 portions of very tender wingetts with the sauce served on the side as it is a little spicy but very lovely.
