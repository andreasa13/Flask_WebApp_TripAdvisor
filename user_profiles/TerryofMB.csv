Wonderful Meal - excellent for pre-show audience,"We had the Filet, Schezwan Long Beans, Asparagus and Mashed Potatoes. Everything was perfect. We probably ordered to much as the portions are a decent size but it is so hard to choose. I will say my favorite was the long beans but as noted before EVERYTHING was wonderful.

We dined here before going to the Ahmanson and it is an easy walk between the two if you are so inclined.",February 2020,Nick & Stef's Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32655-d364770-Reviews-Nick_Stef_s_Steakhouse-Los_Angeles_California.html,"Los Angeles, California",restaurants,5.0,4.0

Nice airline - but watch for the carry-on requirements,This was a great airline but their carry on restrictions are strict. When checking into my flight they checked the weight and you guessed it I was overweight so I ended up paying the $60.00 checked bag fee. While I saw may passengers that had bags that were siimilar size and weight they did not have the same issue - it does make you wonder why some people are picked out and others are not (I was not alone in having to go and pay),October 2019,Swiss International Air Lines [SWISS],https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729160-Reviews-Swiss-International-Air-Lines-SWISS,World,flights,3.0,4.0
Tight quarters,The leg room is a tight but that is true of most airlines now if you are flying economy. I was not surprised the flight was crowded but I am sure most of the others on my flight probably booked as I did for the lowest price offered on a flight to Athens.

Iconic,"This is a must see on any visit to Athens. The acropolis is currently under renovation to preserve this historic site but that does not diminish the overall experience by much.

Exceeded expectations for a quick meal,The atmosphere may a little lacking - but the food is great! My friend and I really enjoyed everything we every ordered here. The food is fresh and delicious. There are so many options it can be hard to choose. I came here every morning of my stay here to get a coffee and pastry of some type. They have both sweet and savory options. I tried and like both options. But because the breakfast items were so good we also came here to get dinner a couple of times and were not disappointed! The articoke hearts with potatoes were amazing!!! I also enjoyed the Moussaka. The prices here were extremely affordable so if you want some delicious food at a great price this is a great place to go.,October 2019,Bread Factory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d11816586-Reviews-Bread_Factory-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Beautiful,While the bus trip is not short going to Delphi was worth it. I enjoyed hearing more about the history of the various items located at the site in addiion to the information I already knew about Delphi. The views from here are spectacular especially if you hike all the way up to the stadium. The museum is also worth a visit. The items on display are well displayed in a modern building to show them in their best light.,October 2019,Delphi day tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d5568551-Reviews-Delphi_day_tour-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Exceeded All Expectations,"This trip was one of the best trips I have ever taken! The side hikes off the river show the diversity of the area and lead to beautiful waterfalls, vistas, and just cool places to hang out and listen to music provided by our guides! If you can I would ask to have Cliff and Oliver (both musicians) and have so much information about the canyon that you will be amazed. You experience both peaceful moments and exciting rapids on this trip. You have the option to sit in the front portion of the boat (the wet zone) or towards the rear for a little more comfort and much drier. The meals provided are cooked at camp by the guides and are of good quality with an excellent variety. They also accomodate for vegetarian and vegan rafters if you advise them in advance.

Our group all got along which made the experience even better - you could not ask for more. This trip is good for couples, singles, friends, and families.

I highly recommend this outfitter!

If you have more time you may want to consider the 14 day raft trip - but I found the 7 day trip to be just the right amount of time.",September 2019,Canyoneers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60971-d14132852-Reviews-Canyoneers-Flagstaff_Arizona.html,"Flagstaff, Arizona",attractions,5.0,5.0

Great Sandwiches,"The sandwiches we ordered here were excellent! They were made with good quality ingredients and are very large. We ordered the Club Subs with Avocado and could not have been happier! They are off the main highway but worth finding.

Amazing! Try to see at night if possible!,This is a beautiful memorial which is worth seeing - but if you really want the full experience see it at night. The way they have this lit makes it even more dramatic and the message that more impressive.

Who does not like a good looking Tiki Bar/Restaurant,As you can guess the name gives away the motif and this one is done beautifully.

The restaurant itself if lovely with a beautiful view of the ocean. There is a 5 course tasting menu if you arrive from 5:00-5:45 that everyone raves about but sorry to say we missed this.

The décor is tasteful and a reference to the historic structures here on site. There is a lovely spa, gym, tennis courts, pickle ball and of course golf!

The guided tour is the only way to go in my opinion as the guide is well versed in the mission of the GIA and all that they represent. You see some amazing work (jewelry, photography, loose stones, etc.) and also get a peek at some classes in progress - it was very informative.

Everyone enjoyed their meals. As with most restaurants in this area the prices are not cheap but in line with what a good meal costs today.
Since the produce is from the farm sometimes you can not get what you want. One of our friends was not able to get fresh tomato slices as they were already out of them that day.

The corner window seat was great for taking a break and just looking out at the beautiful coastline or reading - we were in room #10 which is upstairs so make sure you are good with taking the stairs. Be aware that you come here to relax so there is no television but there is Wi-Fi so you are not totally out of touch.

Clean and quite,This is your basic Hampton Inn. Well maintained but this location does not have mini fridges or microwave ovens in the room. There is the standard free breakfast and WiFi. The staff was friendly and courteous.,February 2018,Hampton Inn & Suites Tucson East / Williams Centre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60950-d1485691-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Tucson_East_Williams_Centre-Tucson_Arizona.html,"Tucson, Arizona",hotels,3.0,4.5
Loved it!,"A group of us went to Sushi Ran for lunch and it was truly amazing. We shared the seaweed salad, crunch roll, kaisen futo-maki, and the tempura udon noodle. We loved it all!

The location is just off the main tourist street in Sausalito.

If you are having a yen for sushi and are nearby make this your stop.",November 2017,Sushi Ran,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33062-d379256-Reviews-Sushi_Ran-Sausalito_Marin_County_California.html,"Sausalito, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great Pizza and Salad,"This place is quite charming and the food was excellent.

We started with the Point Reyes Blue Cheese Organic Salad, and followed that with a Margarita Pizza and a Chicken Sausage Pizza. If you are having the salad as your appetizer (or with your meal) order the small it was enough for four of us since we were having pizza too.

Also they have free donut holes for just a taste of sweetness if you do not have room for that lovely pie!

We came here with our appetites after visiting the beach at Point Reyes and this really hit the spot.",November 2017,Cafe Reyes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32908-d346645-Reviews-Cafe_Reyes-Point_Reyes_Station_Point_Reyes_National_Seashore_Marin_County_Californi.html,"Point Reyes Station, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Surprisingly Good!,"I did not know what to expect as this is a low cost airline - but this was a very pleasant flight. It was a newer Dreamliner and while you do pay for checked baggage (if you have any) or want to choose your seat, these were not a issue for us We were still seated together and the service on the plane was excellent if you needed anything.

If you want food/drinks you can place your order on the touch screen in front of you and pay with your credit card and your items will be brought to you in short order. I thought the prices for the items offered were fair.

This was a very pleasant and cost effective way to travel. I plan to use them again.",September 2017,Norwegian,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729125-Reviews-Norwegian,World,flights,4.0,3.5
"Good location, friendly and helpful staff","We chose this hotel as it is located in a good part of Rome without being directly in the high traffic tourist area. You have easy access to everything you could want to do from this hotel. You can take a bus/trolley (stop is right in front of the hotel) or you can have the excellent hotel staff call a taxi for you.

You can also walk to a few things (Villa Borghese, Zoo, Art Museum, or Catacombs) if that is something you enjoy.

Rooms are on the small side but they are well thought out and use the space well.

I would stay here again.",September 2017,Hilton Garden Inn Rome Claridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d203182-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Rome_Claridge-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,4.0,4.0
Must See,This is one of the must see locations in Rome. The history of the building alone makes it worth the trip. There is always a line to enter but it is fast moving so do not let that deter you from entering. This is a wonderful stop and the fact that it is free is a bonus.,September 2017,Pantheon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d197714-Reviews-Pantheon-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
Amazing Villa,"This is an amazing venue and worth a visit. If you love art it is worth getting a private guide to explain the finer points of the artwork and history of the villa - which is of note.

Make sure to get your tickets in advance as this is done with timed entry tickets. If you plan it right you should really try and walk the surrounding gardens and park along with enjoying the Villa.",September 2017,Villa Borghese,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190133-Reviews-Villa_Borghese-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful,You can't come to Rome and not see the Trevi Fountain. I came here two times during our visit (once at around 4 pm and the next morning at 8 am) while the morning is less crowded do not think you will be the only one there. But if you are looking to take some pictures the morning still rules.,September 2017,Trevi Fountain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190131-Reviews-Trevi_Fountain-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
Massive Monument,"This is a massive monument in the center of Rome. If you like military history this is a good place to come. There are nice displays of military flags, insignias, and other items.

It also makes a good meeting spot as you can not miss it!",September 2017,Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190985-Reviews-Monumento_a_Vittorio_Emanuele_II-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
Delicious,"This restaurant is popular for a good reason - the food is great. I have never been here when there is not a crowd.
This is a seafood restaurant so if anyone in your group is not a seafood eater your options are very limited. But given that for seafood this is the place - fresh fish and excellent sides!
Parking in the area can be tough but there is a two story city lot across the street which works as you are unlikely to find street parking nearby.",October 2017,Fishbar Manhattan Beach Seafood Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32678-d2203656-Reviews-Fishbar_Manhattan_Beach_Seafood_Restaurant-Manhattan_Beach_California.html,"Manhattan Beach, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great camping on the central coast,"We loved our stay here at the San Simeon Creek Campground. While it is right off the highway you do not need to cross over it to reach the beach as there is an under pass which takes you from the campground to the beach. This is a great spot to view wildlife, look for moonstones, or just walk on the beach.

It is located close to Cambria and San Simeon so you will have options for dining out if you choose.

The campground sites are nice and the facility has showers (you will need quarters to use them) that are well maintained.

I plan on coming back again soon.",August 2017,San Simeon State Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33039-d216015-Reviews-San_Simeon_State_Park-San_Simeon_San_Luis_Obispo_County_California.html,"San Simeon, California",attractions,5.0,4.0
Excellent!,"We came here for breakfast at 8:00 am on a Sunday and still had to wait. The food is excellent prepared with fresh ingredients. Our group had a variety of items but I must say my favorite was the ricotta stuffed berry french toast.

Parking can be a challenge even early in the day so keep that in mind - but do not let that deter you from coming.

If you do not want to wait there is a lovely take out portion to this restaurant too.",July 2017,Claire's on Cedros,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33101-d1522152-Reviews-Claire_s_on_Cedros-Solana_Beach_California.html,"Solana Beach, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Trendy and Tasty!,"This place was packed with happy people enjoying their evening! Great food, excellent drink selection - who could want more. From the exterior you would not guess that this place is as nice as it is - not that it looks bad just that it is a wood and glass exterior located by Whole Foods in a shopping center. but once inside you walk through a gauntlet of wine and then the view explodes into the bar and dining areas - the pillow packed banquets are a nice touch as are the horses strung on wire (acknowledging you are in Del Mar after all) delineating the staircase to the upstairs.

The food was amazing - we ordered family style and shared the chopped salad (escarole, radicchio, casalingo salumi, caciocavallo, shishito, tomato, ceci bean, castelvetrano, crouton, oregano vinaigrette)which was a lovely explosion of tastes. This was accompanied by the triangoli (eggplant, roasted grape, ricotta salata, crispy ceci bean, mint sunflower seed pesto) and the mushroom pizza (mushroom, goat cheese, fried onion, truffle oil).

I highly recommend this restaurant!",July 2017,CUCINA enoteca Del Mar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32286-d5444604-Reviews-CUCINA_enoteca_Del_Mar-Del_Mar_California.html,"Del Mar, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Scrumptious!,We went there on a Saturday on the recommendation of one of the locals and they were right this place is fantastic! While I did not have time to try other types they all looked great - I don't really think you can go wrong with any of their choices.,June 2017,Surfside Donuts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32894-d8292305-Reviews-Surfside_Donuts-Pismo_Beach_San_Luis_Obispo_County_California.html,"Pismo Beach, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
