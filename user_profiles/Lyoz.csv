Great coffee,I’m not into the specialty drinks but I do get a cappuccino once in a while just for a little change and everything is always good.

Excellent Polish dishes,It’s a small place but the food was really good and the prices are very reasonable. I had their pork special and the sourkraut soup and on a cold winter evening it really hit the spot.

Nice site,Not really much standing at this site but you can get the general idea of the layout and the location of the buildings. If you have any interest in the apostle Paul than this is where it’s reported that he preached so there are usually a few Christian tours reading the gospel as your walking around. Museum is small but some nice Roman artifacts and a really nice Greek helmet.,September 2019,Archaeological Museum of Corinth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189484-d243255-Reviews-Archaeological_Museum_of_Corinth-Corinth_Corinthia_Region_Peloponnese.html,"Corinth, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5

Tremendous location,What a view! Both the ride to the site and once you climb up through the site there are tremendous views of the valley below. The site itself is obviously only a shadow of its former glory but you can tell from what remains that it was a great and sacred site for the ancient Greeks.

You will feel like a king,"Standing at the top of this hill looking down at the valley below, you will feel like a king.

One of the top five in Greece,"This was one of my top five things that I saw in Greece. I was so impressed by the construction of this theatre. Our tour guide had us climb to the top of this 15,000 seat theatre and she dropped a coin and ripped a piece of paper on the stage and we could hear it just as clearly as if we were in the front row.

We really couldn’t get over how beautiful the hotel was with beautiful stone work throughout, large spacious rooms, big pool and great selection of food for both breakfast and dinner.

Cool statue,Not sure why I liked this but I just thought it was great that a city today would spend money on a large statue.

Completely covered archeological site,The only completely covered archeological site that I have ever seen which makes it very pleasant to walk around and visit. Must be seen with a guide because the few signs don’t give you the full story and you need someone to explain things.

Excellent food and drink,"We accomplished our mission. My wife and I needed to warm our old bones, get some vitamin D and eat/drink well. All of which we completed at this resort for an entire week. The weather was excellent which was our main focus - because when we left home it was 8 degrees and when we landed it was 80. The sun shone every day with only a drizzle one evening and all of the food was really good. The liquor was all name brands, the bars were within easy reach and the in room refrigerator was refreshed twice a day. No matter how they made their chicken it was always moist, the deserts were excellent and the lobster tails Friday night at the eight rivers restaurant were large and done just right. The only area which needed improvement was the entertainment. It’s not that the singers weren’t good and we really enjoyed the steel drum band. It’s just that it was pretty much the same every night. I know it’s a Caribbean island what do I expect but we’ve been to other islands and they do try to vary it a little. Tip, don’t do the shopping trip off the resort.

We went for a birthday celebration and the food was good with a nice selection for everyone but no one was blown away by anything and the one complaint that everyone had was that it was really loud. So if you’re looking for a quiet romantic dinner this is not the place. I would go back, just with slightly less expectations.

Really close to the park entrance,Small hotel with clean rooms and close to the Manuel Antonio Park entrance. I'd come back to this hotel since it's just far enough away form the beach and park entrance to not have the commotion but just an easy walk to restaurants and shops.

I was disappointed that I could not leave and come back in the same day without paying again.

It was clean, quiet and the van arrived when we needed it but it wasn't close to anything but the airport.",February 2018,Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Philadelphia Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60795-d96715-Reviews-Microtel_Inn_Suites_by_Wyndham_Philadelphia_Airport-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",hotels,3.0,2.5
Great for Lunch,"We ate here twice and each time the food and drinks were great. A huge selection soI would have gone back to try even more. Excellent crepes, watermelon juice and makiccino.",February 2018,Orchid Coffee Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g951347-d2414023-Reviews-Orchid_Coffee_Shop-Monteverde_Province_of_Puntarenas.html,"Monteverde, Costa Rica",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Better after dark,They let you visit during the day and then come back at night for free-they even provide a flashlight. During the day some of the frogs are out and at night others so since we were staying just up the road we visited twice. Excellent selection of frogs. Since many are really small and camouflaged it's hard to see them in the wild so this really was the only way to see some of them. Good for kids and curious adults.,February 2018,Ranario Monteverde Frog Pond,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g644053-d2721044-Reviews-Ranario_Monteverde_Frog_Pond-Santa_Elena_Monteverde_Province_of_Puntarenas.html,"Santa Elena, Costa Rica",attractions,4.0,4.0
Not a big fan of snakes,"While I'm not a big fan of snakes, this was still interesting to me to see the scary stuff that might be lurking under the bushes, without getting to close to the glass. Good selection of both venomous and non-venomous snakes along with some turtles and lizards.",February 2018,Serpentario,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g951347-d1572532-Reviews-Serpentario-Monteverde_Province_of_Puntarenas.html,"Monteverde, Costa Rica",attractions,4.0,4.0
Really nice learning experience for adults and kids,They start out with a lecture about geological periods and show the advantages for animals to go through different stages of metamorphosis. Besides butterflies they also talk about scorpions and other indigenous bugs so it's really well done.

Incredible smells,"Lots of orchids, obviously not all bloom at the same time but the variety was astounding in such a relatively small garden. I really never knew orchids could have so many different smells. Everything from tutti-frutti to Chanel no5 to orange and even blood.",February 2018,Monteverde Orchid Garden,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g644053-d2529634-Reviews-Monteverde_Orchid_Garden-Santa_Elena_Monteverde_Province_of_Puntarenas.html,"Santa Elena, Costa Rica",attractions,4.0,4.5
