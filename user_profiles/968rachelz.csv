Once again great service!,"We used Rome cab transfer on our way in and out of the city and both times the driver arrived early and was kind and polite and speaks good English.

Good Tiramisu,"We visited twice this little Tiramisu shop in the center of the city. The idea of 2 sizes is clever since it allows you to taste more than one flavor at once. The original and the Pistaciu are better than the other flavors. Nice for a quick stop or a take away because there are only a few seats on the bar
We ate good Tiramisu in other places in Rome so I wouldn't define it as the best like we read here in some reviews before but it is certainly one of the best in the center of the city.",December 2019,Two Sizes -Tiramisù in Rome-,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d11917500-Reviews-Two_Sizes_Tiramisu_in_Rome-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Plan to come back!,"We enjoyed a 3 nights stay in Hotel Damaso.
the location is central and the service was very good.
We enjoyed the breakfast buffet which is very diversified and the additions of an omelet that is prepared on the spot specifically to your requests and a good cappuccino were very nice touches.
The room and the bathroom were spacious, modern and convenient. Once again a final touch of some chocolates before bedtime was appreciated.
The only thing that bothers a bit is the noise from the street since the hotel is located on the main street on one side, each night we couldn't avoid the noise of police cars and ambulance sirens.
We do plan to come back and ask for a rear room.",December 2019,Hotel Damaso,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d12497396-Reviews-Hotel_Damaso-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,5.0,5.0
Disappointing service and too loud music,"When we first entered the restaurant the ambiance seems cool with middle eastern music that matched the dishes served later. Unfortunately, the music was so loud that you couldn't speak to a person next to you and it's quite annoying and more appropriate for a dance club and not a restaurant where you want to have a nice dinner.
The food was good except for the dessert that was a huge disappointment. seems that someone in the kitchen forgot the sauce that is a crucial part of the cake we've ordered and hence it was so untasty.
The service was unprofessional across the whole evening with a waiter that forgot a glass of wine although he was reminded twice, a random waiter or waitress that served us and eventually no one cares that most of the dessert was left on the plate. The only one of the team that seems to care was the waitress that gave us our coats before we left that wanted to understand why we were so disappointed with the dessert. But although she was, for a change, attentive she didn't offer any sort of compensation.
Overall it's not a cheap restaurant, for similar prices, we ate much better food and got a much more excellent service in the other evenings during this trip to London.",October 2019,Coal Office Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d15049972-Reviews-Coal_Office_Restaurant-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5

Good value for money and very convenient location!,"The room was small but very well organized, it was designed with lots of thought and so every inch is used wisely. Lots of storage place in drawers under the bed so you can unpack your suitcase when you come for a few days.
For 5 pounds you get a varied breakfast and we used it every morning during our stay there.
There is also very reasonable pricing on cocktails, beers, and light food in the evenings and you can get tea and coffee for free all day long (although it would have been more convenient if there was a kettle in the room).

Wonderful B & B,"We spent 1 night in this lovely small B & B.
The room was clean and when we had a problem with the hot water it was solved promptly.

Just ok,"It's quite evident that a lot of money was spent on this huge museum but unfortunately, it doesn't add too much to the knowledge regarding the Titanic.
The building itself is quite impressing and the trolley ride inside is fun (we were quite lucky not to wait a long time in line) but otherwise, if you have only half a day to spend in Belfast (like we had) it's best to do the Black Cab Tour and wonder in the city and not necessarily visit this museum.",June 2019,Titanic Belfast Entrance Ticket: Titanic Visitor Experience Including SS Nomadic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g186470-d12027392-Titanic_Belfast_Entrance_Ticket_Titanic_Visitor_Experience_Including_SS_Nomadic-Be.html,"Belfast, United Kingdom",activities,3.0,4.5

Nice afternoon break but not the best,"Overall the atmosphere is nice and it's a nice and relaxed pause in the afternoon.
For the price paid we expected an impeccable experience, however, we've been in a much better afternoon tea experiences elsewhere.
The service was nice but not quite attentive: seems that the same staff has to serve the customers on the terrace as well as those inside the room. But the reason it was just an average experience and not a WOW one like expected is the quality of the pastries. Seems that the emphasis is on the visibility and the photo opportunity rather than the taste and it's a pity.",June 2019,Art Tea at The Merrion Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186605-d6222881-Reviews-Art_Tea_at_The_Merrion_Hotel-Dublin_County_Dublin.html,"Dublin, Ireland",restaurants,3.0,4.5

After a few days in the city, I would definitely recommend staying on the south side of the river, we found it to be much closer to the majority of the attractions and much more agreeable.

A must visit,"No doubt, in my opinion, that while in Athens you should visit the Acroplis.
Actually since the Acropolis which means upper city is higher that the rest of the old city, you can see is lovely sight from anywhere in the old city center and it's exciting to climb eventually and visit this site of historically significance.
We bought a ticket for a guided tour just to avoid the queue at the entrance but although the tour guide was clearly very knowledgeable she wasn't an interesting guide, Our recommendation is to buy your ticket yourself online and tour the Acropolis on your own.",March 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Very good hotel but the service is a bit slow,"We stayed in this hotel for a short weekend vacation and enjoyed the modern amenities, the varied breakfast buffet and the great location.
Another nice thing is the gorgeous view of the Acropolis from the restaurant on the top floor.
There were however 2 problems, the main problem was their inability to let us enter the room at the promised time - although we came back (after storing our luggage earlier) 10 minutes before 14:00 - the Check-in time according to the hotel policy, it took them another 45 minutes (!) and several assertive reminders from our side till they finally gave us the room. The lobby was by that time very noisy full of other guests that tried to get to their room on time with no luck.
Another thing is that the elevators are very slow in the mornings.
Seems that they have to sort out some efficiency issues in this new hotel.",March 2019,Elia Ermou Athens Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d15656080-Reviews-Elia_Ermou_Athens_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Finally an opportunity to taste Pierre's Herme creations in front of his pâtisserie !,"After years of visiting Paris and consuming the fine pastries of Pierre Herme on the bench at St. Sulpice square (the closest bench to his old shop), it's possible to sit and relaxed for a few minutes with a cup of tea or coffee aside the chosen cake/ macaron.
The prices are high and the place is quite small but comfortable enough for a short sweet break.
My most loved item here is undoubtedly the Croissant Ispahan.

Horrible service!,"We ordered cappuccino but unfortunately got a coffee that taste horrible since the milk was spoiled. Obviously after one sip of the coffee we asked the waitress to take the coffee and prepare for us another with a different milk. She came back after a minute and announced that the milk is good and walked a way without waiting to hear us anymore. The barista or the manager didn't bother themselves and couldn't care less. We didn't have a choice but to leave very disappointed obviously without paying for a product that we couldn't consume.
If it wasn't enough that we were ignored and expected to consume a rotten product when we came out the owner start shouting at us since we obviously didn't pay and left the coffee almost as we got it on the table.He tried to humiliate us in front of all customers and shouted that we can return to our country and later cursed us in French ( unfortunately for him I did understand it) -

Good hotel in a convenient location,"The room was cosy and comfortable and included small refrigerator with free light beverages.
Another nice feature in this hotel is that you have some snacks, hot drinks and light beverages free of charge in the lobby at all times.
The personnel was friendly and helpful and the location was very convenient -in between 3 different metro stations with different lines.
Two disadvantages: the bathroom was very tiny and was hence less comfortable.
The second thing that needs improvement is the consistency of the breakfast - We had 4 breakfasts here but each day something else was missing and one morning many things were missing and only some of them were completed later after we've asked for, several items were simply missing.",December 2018,Hotel Monterosa - Astotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d313060-Reviews-Hotel_Monterosa_Astotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great base for touring the ravishing Dordogne & Lot region with lovely hosts,"We have enjoyed this lovely and tranquil base for our travel during a week .
The hosts - Yvette & Paul are originally Flemish and they decided to made the Lot region their home. Paul was very helpful regarding recommended sights and restaurants in the region and can provide also some maps & brochures if you need it.
The rooms are spacious with great renovated shower and lot's of place in the bathroom & in the room to store your stuff.The room is actually a suite of 2 rooms with a separate living room/ TV room.
The Breakfast was rich and varied.
We didn't have time to use their poll since we came rather late at the end of each traveling day since we wanted to explore this spectacular region to it's fullest but it seems nice and the couple do provide extra towels for the swimming pool.
Down stairs there is also a kitchen that served all the tenants and you can store some products in the refrigerator and even cook yourself meals (if you insist, we preferred some good restaurants in Cahors - the small city that is located 15 minutes away).
Bottom line: Warm recommendation for the place, the hosting, the view & the food.",September 2018,Chambres dHotes Maison Les Fraysses B&B,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2484373-d3668959-Reviews-Chambres_d_Hotes_Maison_Les_Fraysses_B_B-Bellefont_La_Rauze_Lot_Occitanie.html,"Bellefont-La Rauze, France",hotels,5.0,5.0
Do yourself a favor & keep looking for a much better hotel!,"I'll start with the positive things because it's really short:
1. Great renovated shower.
2. Convenient location near several options of public transportation.

Unfortunately it's surely not enough and from years of traveling and especially in Paris I know for certain that for the same money you could do much much better:

1. The service was horrible: the not so kind receptionist gave us a room that was tiny compare to others (small by not so tiny) with no closet, no space to put anything in the bathroom, a broken lock on the door and a safe that can't be closed either, hence we can't use it! only after a very assertive complaint he was willing to give us the room next door that surprisingly enough was already renovated and we can actually close it's door, put our clothes in the closet, use the safe and a have a little space in the room.
2. The Elevator is practically not useful: when we came the elevator didn't work at all and we have to carry our suitcases in a very narrow and twisted staircase.
When the elevator did work it was of no use since it's not really gets to the level of the room. you have to take a few steps down and then some more steps up in order to get to it, so we didn't use it till the last day, then after a very long wait we could use this tiny elevator with our luggage after we carry it on the stairs..
3. The worst was the deceive/negligence of the lady that was in the reception on our last day: she promised and we verify twice the price for a taxi to CDG airport and she seems very experienced and confident in herself. She indeed ordered the taxi or us but at the evening when we arrive to the airport the driver demanded 24% more and we didn't have a choice but pay him and hurry to our flight!",September 2018,Hotel des Bains,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d194236-Reviews-Hotel_des_Bains-Paris_Ile_de_France.html,"Paris, France",hotels,2.0,4.0

The location is great, the room was reasonable in his size and was modern with great shower, decent wardrobe, safe, mini fridge, hair dryer and a kettle - all the useful amenities you need in your stay.
Everyone in the front desk speaks good English and all are willing to help if needed.
We didn't take their breakfast but, again, in such a central location there are lots of cafes nearby so you can make your choice on the spot.

No justification for those prices and no reason to visit this over rated location of Champ Elysee,"We came with great expectations due to the combination of those 2 great french ""institutions"".
The first disappointment was that there is no real merger between the two brands it's just a blunt trial to sell 2 different successful brands with almost no connection between those brands (there was 2 L'oocitane products that was done in collaboration with Pierre Herme).
The main disappointment was the overpricing - 15 euros for a piece of cake is a bit excessive and the service wasn't exceptional or even special or nice enough to justify those prices.
I would continue, like each time in Paris, to consume Pierre Herme excellent products on the bench in front of St. Sulpice church right across his main shop in Rue Bonaparte.

Disappointment,"After reading good reviews we came with high expectations for a reasonably price good bistro food but unfortunately was disillusioned.
The first dish was ok, nothing special to write home about but OK.
The main dish was a fish that was overloaded with oil that simply destroyed the delicate fish completely.
The dessert again was ok, nothing special.

We enjoyed the privacy and the feeling of living in an apartment. You have a code that opens both doors - from the street and to your room. We got room 9 since we've asked for a quiet room, the drawback is that there is no view but it got the advantage we preferred of being quiet.
The service was unstable: on the first day we put the door's sign and thought that they will clean the room but it turns out that both sides of the sign keep them out of your room (unlike the a custom that one side declares ""don't disturb"" and the other ""please clean my room""). The problem was that the day after they only arrange the bed but not the bathroom and left us with no clean towels. To their credit I must note that they called us immediately back after we left a message and told us where we can find clean towels and the next day they found a lovely way to compensate with a tray with a kettle, tea & pastries.
Overall the room was very spacious and the shower was completely renovated and very comfortable.
The design is modern & clean. The location was great. There is a basket in the entrance with small bottles of mineral water which is very useful.
To sum up: I would love to stay in Hall Chiado again.",April 2018,Hall Chiado,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189158-d3535118-Reviews-Hall_Chiado-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",hotels,4.0,4.5

Great Walking Tour,"We took this tour on our first day in Lisbon ant it gave us great introduction to this lovely city. Our guide Kate was nice and knowledgeable and it was interesting to hear her explanations and stories and she also gave us many useful recommendations for restaurants, shops and Fado bars that some of them we used in the next days after out tour.",April 2018,Take Lisboa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189158-d11891322-Reviews-Take_Lisboa-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",attractions,5.0,5.0
yummy and there a place to seat!,"Unlike many shops that sell pastel de nata in Lisbon, here you can seat and drink a coffee as well and the Pastel is made in front of your eyes and tastes good.

Fantastic day tour with a great tour guide,"We enjoyed our almost private tour with Rui along the coast of the Atlantic ocean till Pena palace & Sintra.
It's a maximum 8 people group and we were lucky that only one other couple was that day with us so our lovely driver & tour guide - Rui - added some few extra stops that wasn't in the original description. We had good lunch in an authentic restaurant in the way instead of eating in the more touristic restaurants in the center of Sintra.
The stops in the coast & Pena palace are beautiful. we wasn't so impressed with Sintra itself.
They have 6 different drop-off points so we had one just 3 minutes walk from our hotel.
Overall: it's a convenient way to see all those beautiful sights without having the trouble of renting a car for just one day trip & the tour guide adds lot of information for us not only on the sights but on life in Portugal, which was really interesting.",April 2018,"Full-day Tour of Sintra, Pena Palace, and the Portuguese Riviera from Lisbon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189158-d11991438-Full_day_Tour_of_Sintra_Pena_Palace_and_the_Portuguese_Riviera_from_Lisbon-Lisbon_.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",activities,5.0,5.0
The Best Pastel de Nata in Lisbon,"It was simply the best Pastel de Nata that we tried in Lisbon and it survived well even a trip back home and a few days in the refrigerator before my colleagues at work had the chance to enjoy a bit of Lisbon as well.

"Overrated, not worth your time!","If you want to try the Pasteis de Belem do yourself a favor and try to have a table because the queues outside for the ones that want to buy & go are insane! we didn't succeed in the first day and in another day after visiting Belem we had a chance to catch a table without waiting.
The Pasteis itself is very average and disappointing, inside the city we had much better Pastel de Nata!",April 2018,Pastéis de Belém,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d939704-Reviews-Pasteis_de_Belem-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html,"Lisbon, Portugal",restaurants,3.0,4.5
"Great location, excellent service, very nice breakfast","Hotel Abruzzi is located in front of the Pantheon - right in the center and you can practically walk everywhere.
The room was spacious and renovated, the Wi-Fi worked impeccably during the whole stay. The service was great in every hour we wanted to ask something we found helpful member of the staff in the reception desk.
Breakfast was served in a coffee house that was 15 meters from the hotel and was served in a buffet which included a variety of eggs, cheeses, cold meats, fruits, cereals, juices. pastries and coffee.
We had an excellent stay and definitely will consider coming back again next time in Rome.
The only thing that needed to be mention is that there is no elevator, we were in the annex on the first floor and it did't matter to us but it might be important to someone who is unable to climb stairs easily.",January 2018,Hotel Abruzzi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187791-d236134-Reviews-Hotel_Abruzzi-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",hotels,5.0,4.5

Famous coffee institution that you shouldn't miss,"If you love coffee you must visit Tazza D'oro while in Rome.
We visited there a few times during this last visit to Rome and it wasn't the first time.
You should be aware that it's not a coffee house where you can sit and rest with your coffee but rather a place where you get your coffee in a long bar, you can have some pastries as well but everything is served while standing in front of the bar and you're drinking in a few minutes and continue in your way. it's the way the Italians drink their coffee.
The coffee is excellent and the prices are very friendly.",January 2018,Tazza D'Oro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d8339131-Reviews-Tazza_D_Oro-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Good Tiramisu in a tiny and over crowded place!,"We chose the option of 3 smaller portions for each of us so altogether we tasted 6 different and it was good, although not all of them in the same level.
Although by the name you might think the place serves only
tiramisu, actually it's more a wine bar with variety of dishes and it was really packed and crowded while we were there to the level that many times during our visit we had to get up and move our chair in order to enable a staff member of another guest to cross. It was quite annoying and seriously interfere with the whole experience. It's like they're trying to squeeze as many guests as possible in a tiny place instead of focusing on giving a good service to fewer guests.",January 2018,Mr. 100 Tiramisu,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d13223918-Reviews-Mr_100_Tiramisu-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,3.0,4.5
"Good food, nice atmosphere and great service","We had a very good lunch in this nice restaurant that is a bit far from the very crowded places in the ancient center of Rome.
You can find innovative dishes as well as classic ones and everything we tasted was delicious.
The Tiramisu is quite unique compare to other places, it is served inside a chocolate ball (see in the picture) and it's recommendable!
The place itself is quite big and the restaurant is a part of a complex that includes a delicatessen & a workshop space. The service was good and overall it was a very nice experience and we will be happy to visit again!",January 2018,Romeo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187791-d3656680-Reviews-Romeo-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",restaurants,5.0,3.5
Highly recommended experience in Rome!,"We had a 4 hours ( that took a bit longer..) food tour in Testaccio with Emma and it was a real nice experience!
We had 6 different food stops and in between Emma, our lovely guide, took us to the Pyramid & the A-Catholic cemetery (it was actually a nice experience and not one that suppresses appetite, as it might sounds).
It was a great opportunity to visit a neighborhood that real Romans lives in and not crowded with tourists, we visit places where locals eats and buys their food and it was enjoyable.",January 2018,Eating Europe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d2201794-Reviews-Eating_Europe-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,5.0
A spectacular must-see site!,"Visit Barcelona without a visit to this spectacular Gaudi's church, would be simply incomplete!

Great service and nice design but no so practical,"The overall stay was good due to wonderful and helping staff -each and everyone of them (we've been there for a week) and especially the lovely Nuria!
The location is also great, very close by to placa de catalunya but not in the middle of all the hassle and bustle of the Ramblas .
Another good thing in this hotel is the nice buffet breakfast that is quite varied for a very reasonable price.
The problem is that the rooms are suitable for couples or for one person and will be quite awkward for business partners or for friends that's because the shower is completely transparent to the room (I've seen 3 different rooms).
Another problem is the lack of space to put your staff outside the suitcase if you came for more than 1 night - there are a few shelves but no cupboard with enough space for 2 person to unpack.
Another practical issue with the shower is that it's isolated in a separate chamber with a door without an option to put the towel anywhere but outside (otherwise it'll get totally wet).. so you have to finish your hot shower open the door to take the towel which is quite freezing and then pass to the another separate small room where the sink and the toilet are and some of your necessary toiletries. (there is not enough place to unpack your toilet bag in that small room either..)
And last thing - we reserved the family room (for 3 friends) but got 2 separate rooms that are next to each other but has no linking door as we understood from the description in the hotel's website. That inconvenience + the transparent shower cause us to add a third room (which of course cost substantially more than we planned) but the staff was extremely helpful and manage to find us a solution immediately in the next morning although the hotel was quite full.
To sum up: there is a priority for design over practicality (comfort for the guest and usability of the room) and I wish they will try to combine those 2 elements.",May 2017,Hotel Praktik Vinoteca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d7184002-Reviews-Hotel_Praktik_Vinoteca-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.5
A charming and interesting site,"It's simply a lovely site that you don't want to miss!
we took the guided English tour (you must buy tickets in advance on their web site) and it was very interesting as well as lovely.
Another option to see this charming site is to buy a ticket to one of the concerts, I assume it should be quite an experience to see this beautiful building (and especially the ceiling) and listen to some fine music, I surely intend to try it next time in Barcelona!",May 2017,Palace of Catalan Music,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190824-Reviews-Palace_of_Catalan_Music-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,5.0,4.5
