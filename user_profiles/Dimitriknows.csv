Italian food at its best,"What a place. I'm still raving about it a year later. They are amazing. A bit of background on how we found it and most families will appreciate it.

Well, my wife to the little guy to Locale and they helped out and had no issues assisting us. I immediately made a reservation for dinner and came back the following night. What an experience. The food was more authentic then when I was in Rome. The customer service was amazing.

Great place for brunch and dinner. On the pricier side, but you get what you pay for. The people, service and food are exceptional.

O.G of souvlaki and gyros,"If you find yourself in glorious Athens, please don't forget to visit this spot. Take a break and sit on the patio and enjoy a cold beer with an authentic Gyros. The waiters can be pushy and a bit fast, but overall its an experience that everyone should try.
