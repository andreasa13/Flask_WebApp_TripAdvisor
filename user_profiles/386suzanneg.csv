Lunch and coffee,"Great place to have a meal. Lovely quaint decor and very friendly efficient staff. The meals were tasty and served hot. We had soup and the gnocchi which tasted beautiful with interesting flavours. The atmosphere is really relaxing and you can sit inside or outside in a Garden area. I can’t say enough about the staff they were all knowledgeable, respectful and eager to make our experience the best it could possibly be. Can’t wait to go back and try the scones!",August 2019,The Rusty Bike Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g552276-d10515971-Reviews-The_Rusty_Bike_Cafe-Yackandandah_Victoria.html,"Yackandandah, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great food and service.,Food was fabulous. Pork belly and the salmon dishes very tasty. Desserts were amazing and tasted as good as they looked. Very reasonably priced. The serving sizes are a good size. Staff were very helpful even when there was a small glitch with our booking. Wine selection was extensive. Definitely a place to visit when in Orange.,April 2019,Zona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255326-d13001778-Reviews-Zona-Orange_New_South_Wales.html,"Orange, Australia",restaurants,5.0,4.5
