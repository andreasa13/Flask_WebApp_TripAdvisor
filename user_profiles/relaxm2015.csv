"Affordable, addictive Indian food ! The best I've found in Athens!","I eat here every 2 days when in Athens. The prices undercut all competition at 10 Euros for a curry (korma, tikka masala, butter chicken, rogan josh, etc.) with a rather large, fresh side salad and a heaping portion of white basmati rice. At any other restaurant downtown, you would be paying an extra 5 Euros for the rice/salad. That being said, the dishes are all expertly prepared and the presentation/plating is Instagram-worthy (if you are into that) with sprinkles of cilantro on the curries, etc. My favorite chicken dishes are the chicken tikka masala and the chicken biriyani, as they both use chicken that has been marinated and cooked in the tandoor oven. In contrast, if you get the korma with chicken, it has only been marinated in yogurt and is less flavorful, although the sweet, creamy korma sauce is really addictive for dipping the naan into... The biriyani comes with a nice side of raita, the yogurt, that complements it perfectly as one is salty and spicy (if you get 'medium'), and the other is cooling. I also love their fresh chickpea salad for 5 Euros that is a huge portion and very tasty (enough to feed 2 adults). My least favorite dish is probably the butter chicken, as its red sauce was just too sweet (more than even the korma). The butter paneer dish with a similar red curry sauce is a bit less sweet and highly recommended, especially for dipping the naan. The least sweet of the 3 'red' curry dishes would be the tikka masala, which also has nice chucks of tomato vs. being pureed.

As for the naan, it's addictive and fresh. The garlic is good, but for 1 Euro less, the plain/basic naan is amazing and a huge portion that comes out glistening from the ghee/butter rubbed out before it reaches your table. 1 naan is enough for 2 adults to share, or is 2 meals for 1 adult.

Lastly, the modern bathrooms in the basement are far nicer than most restaurants. The waitresses, who are probably all tri-lingual in English, Greek, and an Asian language, can answer all questions in fluent English and are very nice, as are the chefs you can see cooking in the kitchen. Keep in mind that if you enter on a night when you see at least 5 tables taken, the wait for food will likely be 30+ minutes, as they have 2 chefs and cook everything fresh, on-demand. Really, there is nothing not to like about this place. If you have leftovers, just ask them to pack it for 'take away.' They also take credit cards with a mobile payment processor.

I will keep going at least once a week so long as I am in Athens!

Location: They are 1 long 'avenue' block (as we say in NYC) from the Ambelokipi metro stop. There is also a bus stop in front and only many adjacent corners.",February 2020,NaanStop Indian Cuisine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d17528427-Reviews-NaanStop_Indian_Cuisine-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
solid Ethiopian for 10 Euros,"The location: I went here on a Sat. night around 10 pm and it was empty except for a lone man drinking at the bar. The place was very smoky from cigarette smoking, and the air was stale. I haven't smelled air like that in a decade or more since most countries outlaw smoking indoors in communal spaces. They desperately need a good HEPA filter to filter out the smoke (""Rabbit Air"" brand makes a great HEPA filter in the US for cigar smoking aficionados that people rave about). The neighborhood is rough looking with lots of graffiti, and I found myself avoiding clusters of young men hanging out on dark streets.

The food: 10 Euros of a vegetarian combo plate with 5+ small servings of different foods (yellow lentils, lentils with berbere spice, beets, Greek salad, shiro, green beans, etc) . I was so impressed that the Ethiopian chef/bartender working was able to produce the warm plate of food in what seemed like 15 min. without using a microwave. The presentation was really nice. Unlike most places that give you injera on the side, this place uses 1 massive injera on the base that is folded over on the outer edges, so you have plenty by just using the base and don't need extra. As I was leaving, I saw 2 men get a a large shared plate of what were 2 massive piles of maybe Doro Wat and collard greens with a small pile of white feta or cheese (something Greek they don't serve in the US). All in all, the food is really great for the portion size and price. The injera was also in the top 5% I have ever had (I eat Ethiopian often) and perfect in texture and taste.",February 2020,Habesha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d13188661-Reviews-Habesha-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,5.0
