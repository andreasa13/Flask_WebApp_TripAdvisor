Incredible food and great value,"This place is amazing, by far my favourite restaurant I’ve been to so far in Athens. The food is Greek with a modern twist and it’s great quality. Highly recommend the zucchini balls and any of the cheese pastries but it’s all good.

I also took part in a cooking lesson with one of their chefs at the hotel and it was awesome, would highly recommend as you get a meal as part of it. You have the bits you cook yourself but also a ton of extra dishes and some wine, was amazing value for money.",November 2020,ERGON House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10472648-Reviews-ERGON_House-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Acropolis amazing, walk was surprisingly easy!","So obviously the Acropolis was amazing but the main thing I want to talk about is the walk to the top.

A lot of the reviews make out the walk up to be a bit of a nightmare. I am very very unfit and it was a piece of cake. I was so over prepared, I brought my hiking shoes, gym leggings and a massive bottle of water and honestly It’s a gentle uphill stroll with a few steps here and there. I was honestly shocked when we got to the top.

If you are elderly or disabled I could see this being tough but I think it’s the same as walking up any steep road in Athens because it’s well staggered.

It might be different in the height of summer but it’s honestly nothing to over prep for. Do start from the Acropolis metro side though if you want a longer walk round to the top.",November 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
A few exceptional pieces comically odd staff,"Firstly the building itself and the garden inside are beautiful. When we were greeted inside one of the staff specified that we could take pictures but NEVER in funny poses. She then proceeded to demonstrate what a normal pose would be which was very very funny. Overall the staff did seem a bit on edge the whole time which was odd.

The pieces themselves are a mixed bag but they do have the earliest example of an ancient computer which is a must see. On the other hand the vases section must be about a mile long and a lot of the museum is dedicated to ornamental statues found on graves.

Worth a stop though for sure just for a few of the pieces. Didn’t stop at the cafe, looked a bit dingy despite the beautiful garden outside.",October 2020,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Lovely museum and idyllic cafe,"A small but very stylish museum, really well curated with a few really nice collections. Was impressed with the display of the items as it was far superior to how the other museums display/preserve their pieces.

The cafe and the shop are excellent. The cafe had amazing cake and the shop was full of great books in English as well as Greek",October 2020,Athens Museum of Cycladic Art Admission Ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g189400-d21281166-Athens_Museum_of_Cycladic_Art_Admission_Ticket-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",activities,4.0,4.5

Beautiful & Unique Hotel,"If you want to experience the best of Sibiu this is a great place to stay. It is situated in the beautiful old town, a stones throw away from the main square.

Interesting buildings but not lots to see,"Overall I would say this was a pleasant day out, but it feels like more of a park than a museum. There are lots and lots of buildings to look at here but not really any exhibits per say. All the buildings are locked and some were full of storage equipment for the park. It wouldn't take much for this museum to fill some of the house interiors and then it would be excellent.

There are also lots of great market stalls and a lovely cafe so you can easily make an afternoon of it.",September 2018,"Muzeul Naţional al Satului ""Dimitrie Gusti""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294458-d318261-Reviews-Muzeul_National_al_Satului_Dimitrie_Gusti-Bucharest.html,"Bucharest, Romania",attractions,3.0,4.5
Impressive building,This was one me and my partner went to to tick it off a list of things you have to see in Bucharest. It is absolutely huge and very impressive but I wouldn't say it was particularly pretty. We tried to get closer but there were a lot of very big busy roads and roadworks in front.

Full of hookers,Don't go here. My husband is half Chinese and as soon as we parked I got shouted at by an aggressive group of prostitutes who i assume wanted me off their turf.

"Great fun place, watch for extra charges","This place is great fun, well thought out design so that kids and adults won't mix. Good clean modern facilities. Pool bar was excellent and reasonably priced but avoid the restaurant because it's expensive.. To avoid the charges other reviews talk about, bring your own towel, swimming costume and flip flops and do not wear them in. Have them clean and in a bag.

"Nice Collection, Very Quiet","We actually visited this museum by mistake but once we paid the very reasonable price of two lei each to get in we were greeted by a very pleasant collection of Romanian folk art collected by Dr. Nicolae Minovici. The museum is very small but on the plus side is extremely quiet so you basically get a free guided tour from the very nice staff.

We were also told there was a collection of communist era artwork in a nearby building. We weren't told that it was a collection of erotica (maybe not one to visit with children) but throughly enjoyed it non the less.",September 2018,Muzeul Nicolae Minovici,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294458-d10472598-Reviews-Muzeul_Nicolae_Minovici-Bucharest.html,"Bucharest, Romania",attractions,3.0,4.0
"Great for kids, horrendous lighting","Overall this museum is pretty good. Lots of the taxidermy was very well done. Could see how this place is great for kids.
