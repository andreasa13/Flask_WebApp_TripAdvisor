Nice property if not the right one for us this time,"Lovely location and rooms as well appointed and clean if a little small for a junior suite. As mentioned by other there are a lot of stairs, however this is in keeping with the other hotels in this area. Milen and Argiro on reception are excellent and very professional. Milen in particular suggested and booked yacht and car hire for us and is a credit to the Dana.
In my opinion this hotel should be classed as adult only as we had our daughter (15) with us and whilst we were never made to feel awkward by the staff we were the only travellers who were not in a couple. By way of illustration the loungers by the pool are joined in the middle and fold together and all tables are set up for two. All other guests were polite, however the majority seemed obsessed with taking selfies presumably to post on Instagram.
The pool staff are polite, however they wear their masks under their chins as some kind of fashion accessory and never covering their face as you would expect, this was the same throughout our 4 days at the Dana.
One final mention must go the the porters who are heroic in collecting and carrying you cases (plural) up and down the stairs for you and to our car - they were magnificent and deserve every tip that they get.
The Dana Villas and Suites is a lovely property but one that I would suggest if for adults only, especially if you like selfies.",September 2020,Dana Villas & Infinity Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635607-d196091-Reviews-Dana_Villas_Infinity_Suites-Firostefani_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5

Semi private platinum day cruise,"We were recommended and booked with Vista Yachting by our hotel. Our party of 3 included our daughter and we wanted to ensure that we did not end up on a booze cruise. We decided on the semi private platinum day cruise as we were advised that would be the most appropriate and it was a great experience. There were 12 people including another family of 3 on our boat and it was a fun classy environment. Maria was our main host backed up by Eddie and Christou and they were all very attentive with Maria full of amusing commentary throughout. The food was a really good standard especially when you consider a good portion was cooked fresh onboard on a bbq at the back of the boat.
Hats of to Vista Yachting for providing a super trip.",September 2020,ViSta Yachting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189433-d12603570-Reviews-ViSta_Yachting-Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Lovely service and atmosphere,"Lovely service and atmosphere at this family run restaurant. Throughout our travels in Greece we have eaten out at least twice a day and this place is the quaintest, most relaxing place we have eaten.
The food was good and even though it is a little way of the strip my advice is make the effort and you will be rewarded with a charming atmosphere and good food.",September 2020,Parea Local Cuisine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g642171-d10714986-Reviews-Parea_Local_Cuisine-Parikia_Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Lovely stay,"We stayed her for 3 nights and had a great stay at a lovely property with nice gardens. We stayed in a superior sea view room with a lovely sized balcony with great views of the harbour. The path to the beach is right on your doorstep and makes access to Marcello beach really easy.
The food at breakfast is good with plenty of variety and the restaurant which we ate at twice in the evenings had some of the best food we ate on our trip.
There is a complimentary bus into the town however it is quite infrequent and in my opinion could do with being more frequent as I see no reason for it not to run hourly in the morning till 12 and again later in the day 4pm until 12.
We visited during the covid pandemic and it is understandable and expected that there would be certain restrictions in place to keep both guests and staff safe. All the notices were present and the staff always wore masks, however that’s more than could be said for some of the guests. It must be a difficult balancing act for the resort to maintain safety for all guests whilst ensuring that they do not impose too much on their guests. However for me there is room for improvement at Agnanti as whilst there are notes on the doors to the breakfast area about using the hand sanitisers (provided on all tables) , wearing masks indoors in common areas and no more than 6 people in the breakfast serving area at any time these are not enforced nor are guests politely reminded to improve adherence. I would say that the 50% of the guests complied, however there were a number of families and couples who either through ignorance or choice did not follow the advice regarding masks, sanitiser and numbers which I would suggest could be fixed by a gentle reminder to all tables as they are seated of the rules to keep everyone safe. The service for drinks can also be a little slow, which is frustrating waiting for 20 minutes for 2 cocktails when all appears to be quiet, however if ordered at the pool bar during the day they take 5 mins. The pool is lovely with great loungers and the young lady serving was excellent. It is not too crowded and loungers spaced out to give you some privacy.
I used the gym whilst there which was perfectly adequate for my holiday needs.
Overall I would recommend the Agnanti if you like a quiet stay and do not want to be in the hubbub and a little isolated. If visiting Paros again I would be happy to stay at the Agnanti as my lasting impression is of a
nice room, great terrace/balcony and attentive if sometimes slow staff.",August 2020,Paros Agnanti Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g642171-d241776-Reviews-Paros_Agnanti_Resort-Parikia_Paros_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Paros, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Exceeded expectations,"I’ve just finished a trip to Mykonos staying at the Aeolos resort and feel more than ever the need to review our experience.
We are travelling through Greece for a few weeks and don’t often do summer beach trips and were somewhat apprehensive about visiting Mykonos as we felt it may be too busy for us especially with a young daughter.
From being collected at the port, checked in with a warm welcome from the owner Panos we were definitely looked after superbly.
We were offered the choice of the room being upgraded from our original booking to a family room if we wanted to have the extra space.
However our initial fears disappeared as Panos and his team made our stay wonderful; It has been mentioned in many of the reviews that the service here is good, however I would go further and say that the service exceeds the star rating the property has. Panos and his team always seemed to anticipate what you were thinking or wanted, be it walking over with a towel for your lounger, collecting your cases, offering a lift to town, recommending a trip for the day to arranging car hire - simply put this is 5 star service but never overbearing, there is a lot that other owners could learn from Panos and his team. The service here is better than some 5 star hotels we have stayed in and Panos should be very proud of what he has achieved.",August 2020,Aeolos Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g662620-d529847-Reviews-Aeolos_Resort-Mykonos_Town_Mykonos_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Mykonos, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
WOW - You only Live Twice,"Been here twice and it didn’t disappoint either time. My wife and family were sceptical when I suggested a trip having been before on a ski trip with friends. However the place won them over and was a highlight on our family ski trip to neighbouring Obergurgl.
I can’t imagine how much they must have spent on this place but it feels like going into a Bond villains top secret lair, all highly polished concrete and spectacular views across the mountain range.
Definitely somewhere I will visit again in the future and the attached restaurant is also great.",February 2020,007 Elements,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g608679-d14929084-Reviews-007_Elements-Solden_Tirol_Austrian_Alps.html,"Solden, Austria",attractions,5.0,4.5

Wonderful stay,"Modern contemporary hotel that manages to pull off a homely feel.
We stayed here during the busy February half term (UK) and the staff were at all times never too busy to help answer a query or provide help.
Special mention must go to Peter in the restaurant who looked after us all so well during the week and made our daughter feel special by always anticipating what she would and wouldn’t want to provide alternatives to the a la carte menu.
The spa is a good size whilst not huge and benefits from having an adults only section as well as one for families which we used.
Great trip and we will be back again.",February 2020,Hotel Gurglhof,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608674-d497733-Reviews-Hotel_Gurglhof-Obergurgl_Tirol_Austrian_Alps.html,"Obergurgl, Austria",hotels,5.0,4.5
Stunning,"We had wanted to see this for some years and when we finally got to visit it did not disappoint.
There is no denying it is HOT however well worth a couple of hours sweat and toil walking up for the views that await.
We were advised to use the south entrance as it is less busy and the views are the same, also to avoid late mornings as that’s when most of the organised tours are there. We were fortunate that Athens was quiet when we visited, however the guides told us that up to 26,000 people a day visit at peaks times.",August 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Should be better,"This is a nice hotel located next to the old Olympic stadium about 15 Mins walk from the Acropolis.
The room we stayed in is large and it has clearly been well thought out and finished to a high standard when new. The receptionist who greeted us was very enthusiastic and even brought us 3 cans of beer and suggested we go to the roof top terrace to get a view of the Acropolis and it is fair to say we were very impressed.
On closer inspection the next morning we noticed that the room whilst not dirty had only had a surface clean and not what my wife would call a proper clean. The room as a whole is modern and stylish although it lacks some privacy with as you are able to see into the room from both the stairwell and the seating area downstairs. The bathroom has 3 lights (see picture) which are part of the styling and 2 of them did not work and the drencher shower head was broken and mainly spilled water out of the side rather than through the head itself. We mentioned these issues to the receptionist in the morning who said that she would fix or get the owner to fix, neither of which happened during our 4 night stay. Incidentally the receptionists are different each day plus is only there early morning and appear to be the cleaner and cook for breakfast omelettes also, this was fine for us as independent travellers but may not suit all.
Overall I would say that it was clearly a nice hotel initially but it looks to have dropped its standards, certainly in our room (room1) and the public areas that we used included the chipped and damaged furniture in the breakfast room, the roof terrace whilst amazing views has poorly completed workmanship to the flooring and lighting and throughout our whole stay there was a large water stain on the floor in reception that was never cleaned.
It wouldn’t take much effort to put this hotel right and hopefully they will do this in the future as it is a shame.",August 2020,Pi Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d11737945-Reviews-Pi_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,3.0,4.5

Great location,"We attend here on the 31st floor for 4 nights at the start of a trip across western Canada.
Reception staff advised us after trailing for 18hrs that they no longer had any of the rooms we had booked available (2 double beds). This was not ideal, however they gave us a larger room with a harbour view and placed a casual bed in the room which was ok if not ideal.

Good orientation to the city,"We had Logan as a guide and he was really enthusiastic and had a sound knowledge of the city.
There was a nice icebreaker at the beginning when everyone introduced themselves and told an interesting fact, which I haven’t experienced on a free walking tour before.
The tour covered the main city centre tourist attractions along with some of the more challenging areas of the city.
Logan was a great guide and made the effort to go around the group talking to everyone individually at some point.
The only slight drawback for us was that the break halfway through was at a bar which mean that due to licensing laws we couldn’t take part as we had our 14yr old with us.
All in all I would recommend Toonie tours and Logan for anyone visiting Vancouver who wants to orientate themselves and learn a little about the city’s history.",August 2019,Toonie Tours Vancouver,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154943-d14014678-Reviews-Toonie_Tours_Vancouver-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html,"Vancouver, Canada",attractions,4.0,5.0
Worth a visit,"We had not researched this before booking tickets so were pleasantly surprised with how good it was.
The gondola is well organised into time slots to reduce queue times although you are time
limited at the top and given a return gondola slot also. That said the time at the top was sufficient for us and did not inhibit our enjoyment.
There is a great boardwalk up to the old weather station with stunning views along the way of the surrounding mountains and valley.
There is a lovely restaurant at the top which I will make sure to book the next time I’m in Banff.

Disappointed,"The tour consists of basically driving around in a loud noisy vehicle hoping to see some wildlife from the roadside.
Our guide Ronnie was enthusiastic, however told us nothing that anyone with a passing interest or some common sense would not already know. We saw far more wildlife on our own car journeys during the previous week.
The only animals we saw (along with everyone else who stopped in their own cars) were a group of Elk. Whilst everyone else gets out of their cars, you have to sit on the bus and look through the windows.
Really disappointing as whilst you book the trip in knowledge that the animals are wild, we had expected to be taken to some of the less travelled areas and not the main routes throughout Banff which everyone uses.
In my experience poor value for money, however if I had ‘chanced’ upon a grizzly bear I may have viewed this differently.
Lastly, I would say that friends also took a tour and did not see anything either - perhaps I should have taken more note.",August 2019,Discover Banff Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g154911-d775889-Reviews-Discover_Banff_Tours-Banff_Banff_National_Park_Alberta.html,"Banff, Canada",attractions,2.0,4.5

Disappointing,"This restaurant bar if located in terminal 2 Manchester Airport and is part bar with some craft ales and also serves food. The restaurant itself is nicely styled and looks great. My review focuses on the food as I just had a standard bottle of beer so can’t comment on the ales.
I had a Korean chicken burger which was pretty disappointing and poor value for money. The burger was just a small fried chicken breast with some mildly flavoured coleslaw on it. The coleslaw was straight out of the fridge and freezing cold and so wet that the bun just disintegrated as you were eating it. Whilst you expect to pay a bit more at an airport (although no reason I know of for that other than being a captive audience) however £16 for a small burger and chip still feels excessive given the standard of food.

There is a long wait in the summer sun whilst having bags checked and then a monorail or ferry crossing to enter the park, all in all it took us 50 mins from parking the car to entering the park.

Very poor property,"We booked in here for 6 nights whilst in Florida. We were in block 6 to begin with and the room was filthy with stains on the seating and walls. We asked to be moved to block 7 and were moved to another room which we initially thought was better. But on closer inspection we noticed that the bedding had stains on it but it was past midnight and with children was too late to move that evening. My wife did not sleep at all and the next morning we went to complaint and ask for a refund. We were asked by raj who was very understanding if we wanted to check one more room out in block 10 which was far better than either of the other room being at least clean and more like a hotel room than the other two which were motel rooms.
We stayed as we wanted to get on and enjoy our holiday and not waste time look for accommodation. This room also had really noisy ac which we asked to be fixed however the problem was not resolved in the next 2 nights we stayed. I would also note that when we complained there was another guest also complaining about how dirty his room was and that his family were upset plus he had a dog next door to him which was barking all night.
We were due to spend 2 night here on our way back but have cancelled them as one of the staff told us that they regularly have to move guests due to the condition of the rooms.

Tired property,"We were booked into this property by a travel agent on their recommendation and did not do our own research - big mistake.
When arrived the property it was clear to see that it has seen better times and that the professional photographs are generous to the resort.
The front desk staff went through the motions of checking us in to our beach side room.
We were given directions to our room and went across the pool area and instantly knew that our first impression were correct. This property is very tired and lacking in basic maintenance. We arrived at our room and the door would not open without a shoulder to loosen it. We walked into the room and almost straight back out. The room was dark, dated, damp, peeling paintwork, dirty carpets. This may only be a 3* but that doesn’t mean it should be dirty and not maintained. I should have taken pictures as it was like the Bates motel but you will find these on some other peoples reviews. We went out the the beach and the patio was equally disgusting. My family could not stay there so we checked out immediately. Mariett was very good about this which made me think it was not an unusual occurrence. It may be that they have better rooms on the property but that they would think that this was acceptable is unbelievable.

We arrived on time and were asked if we wanted to be seated or go to the bar for a drink and we elected to be seated only to be told that they needed to clear the table so to have a seat at the bar. After 30 mins at the bar and seeing 2 ‘walk ups’ ask for a table and be given one we enquired about our table whereby the surly girl on reception said she check what had happened and after 5 mins came back to us and arrange for our table, no explanation, apology and we carried our own glasses, bottle and coats to the table.
Our food was average at best and the service was again poor. The focaccia was particularly bad and we had to query if they had even given us the right order as it was like no focaccia we’d ever eaten before.
Our desert came with desert wine which we had to remind them about as they had forgotten to bring with the order.
All in all a really disappointing visit and sadly I get the impression that they have forgotten that every customer is a chance to impress with great service and food or too disappoint. Unfortunately it seems to me that they are trading off their hard earned reputation rather than providing the good experience it used to be some years ago. I’m sure they think that they did a good job though as they added a service charge to the bill 12.5%

Nice contemporary hotel,"We stayed here for a night and found the service superb. All staff were very engaging yet respectful. The rooms and general areas of the hotel are beautifully detailed and everything fits with the Gotham theme. My only minor negative would be the price of the drinks in the brass bar which were expensive £25 for a margarita and gin and tonic. Also was a bit concerned that some of the other guests were going to be partying all night as they had music coming out of their room on the two occasions we passed; however this proved not be a problem when we returned to our room later and luckily we weren’t staying next too them so weren’t disturbed.
I would recommend this hotel as very classy with great staff and attention to detail.

"Great food, average service.","We ate her on a Sunday afternoon whilst having a cheeky beer. Good number of options all really fresh and enjoyable. The starter of Nachos with chilli were particularly nice. Service was slow, we had to chase them after sitting down for 15 mins to take our drinks order. and asked for side plates to eat our food on which never arrived and consequently our meals dropped all over the tables as it is street food and eaten by hand.
We sat outside and people were pestered by street sellers for magazines on several occasions.

Disappointing hotel,"I always try to be fair when doing reviews however, even with this in mind I still find myself having to rate this hotel poorly. We checked in at reception and despite there only being rooms to check in this still took 25 mins plus they could locate our details. We were allocated the wrong rooms and had to go back to reception to be allocated an additional room. Well as a one off you can understand that this was just an error, however it was just the start of how unorganised this hotel appears to be. We were also advised that we could only use the Spa facilities on 3 occasions during our stay and that on 2 of those occasions we would need to use the spa prior to 5pm, which when you are skiing is generally when you are out on the slopes therefore rendering it pointless. I did however attempt to use the spa on a day that I had finished early only to be told that it only had capacity for 12 people and was full. Now if you bear in mind that this hotel has hundreds of guests, the chances of ever getting to use the facilities are extremely rare. I did query this with reception and was told by the manager that I should book and finish skiing early - this to me is absurd, if you advertise and charge in the price for a Spa facility it should be able to cope with more than a tiny percentage of guests.
My main disappointment with this hotel though was the quality of food and the unprofessional staff, but more on them later.
The food served and quality to some degree depended on when you arrived as unless you were early the food tended to be either cold or had run out. I can understand that they need to be aware of waste, however subject to arriving within the meal times I would expect to be served a full variety of dishes and not what is left. The food itself was not to my liking, nor to my friends who are more adventurous in their food choices, even to the extent that they ate the snails that were served, so I don’t think we can be classed as to picky. Additionally there was no hot drinks except at breakfast which left the options of soft drinks or wine only (the wine is poor).
My biggest concern with this hotel is the staff and especially management appear to be very unprofessional. Now let me clarify what I mean as they were never rude and I would not wish to give that impression. The staff dress in a works shirt and then many had jeans, trainer and some had hoodies on occasion, although one of the managers wore the same woollen hoodie all week (no name badge) but he always had scruffy jumper/hoodie and glasses on his head. Alan by comparison was always well dressed and looked the part.
The tables in the dining room were always left with trays and food on them as the clean up team could not cope with turning the tables quickly enough - it resembles a messy school canteen where you often have to find and clear your own table. What is particularly frustrating about all this is that the other staff are always stood around talking to each other and joking around rather than helping out, there appears to be no oversight or management control, in fact often they are joining in or up to 3 stood at the door welcoming people late into service rather than helping out or organising. A further small bug bear of mine is that the staff eat their meals in the same area and not screened off. This may sound picky, however when they are all messing about and being noisy it looks unprofessional and not something I have seen or want to see at a hotel I stay at. As an example they was one occasion when they were throwing bread rolls about. I understand that they are young people, but this should not happen in sight of paying guests, who are sat in a messy room because of lack of staff to clear up. Often mugs at breakfast run out as do glasses in the lunch and evening service, I had to ask most days for staff to get some which they always did politely, but this is indicative of a lack of proactive staff. They appear to do the minimum required.

As mentioned by other contributors they rooms are very small and have 6 hangers for a weeks stay for 2 people. One last bug bear was that the balcony is thick with ice making it a real hazard to use. I understand it’s a ski resort and that it was particularly snowy when I was there however it appeared to be weeks old and was really thick. I’ve had balconies in many ski resorts and never had thick ice like this before.

All in all I would say that this hotel could do so much better than it is currently doing and provide much better service if it was better run.

Free tour with Ian,"We have done many free tours with SANDEMANs in lots of cities and decided to do so again in Lisbon.

I have to say that Ian was brilliant and one of the most passionate and informative guides we have had and he brought all the history together without ever making it hard work to keep up , just enough information without overloading you. He we're so impressed that we booked onto the afternoon paid tour to Alfama as we understood I would be guiding that also.
It transpired that we had a different guide Francisco and I have to say his style was not to our liking, he was very laconic and seemed generally to be going through the motions.

Good guest house,"On a recent ski trip to Austria with Inghams I stayed at the Hotel Eggerwirt in Soll Austria. My initial impressions of the hotel was how friendly the owner is and how hard she works, reception, waiting own and always with a smile and some friendly banter. The hotel itself is a 3* establishment, which I would agree with. The rooms are small but functional with plenty of wardrobe space, balcony (more for summer guests) our room had a bath although our friends who were in a triple room did not. The rooms would benefit from being updated which is not to say they are shabby just a little dated. The food in the restaurant is pleasant and wholesome and portion control good for somebody such as myself who likes to over indulge, ensuring I did not over eat but was adequately fed. If you are after al'carte then this is not the place for you but again the service is generally very good with the owner again helping make the meal with her witty banter, drinks can be a little slow in coming but nothing too serious. I did not use the sauna facilities but noted a sign which indicated that it was only in use on certain days of the week so bear this in mind if you like a daily sauna. Wifi is free which is great as many hotel in Austria have started to charge, it can be very frustrating though as it is only available in reception and around the dining room. It is also very patchy and getting connected can be a lottery, meaning people on my trip were trying to catch up with email, photos home at meal times if they were lucky enough to get online. All in all you get what you pay for and this is a well run, pleasant 3* which I would recommend to others.",February 2013,Hotel & Restaurant Eggerwirt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608680-d500461-Reviews-Hotel_Restaurant_Eggerwirt-Soll_Tirol_Austrian_Alps.html,"Soll, Austria",hotels,3.0,4.5

Beautiful setting - Pity but could do better,"I stayed at Cameron House on April 2012 in a classic room. We arrived at the hotel and were instantly impressed by the concierge service who help us with our bags. Due to other guests being checked in at reception a member of reception staff took us to another area , seated us and completed our details whilst confirming our dinner reservations (a bit of a shame as it turned out as I had booked Martin Wishart's as a surprise but totally innocent on behalf of the staff member)
Our room was initially impressive as it looked great, however it was not very well cleaned, there was significant debris/stains on the carpet and a lot of dust on the leather seat in the room. The rooms are well appointed with all you would expect and a Bose iPod doc. We found that when the room next door moved in that the noise from the TV and Bose was was VERY loud. We had to complain to reception who asked them to turn it down which they did however due to the Set up and location ofnthe tv In the room we could still hear them and the next morning at 7:00.  We were upset and uncomfortable in our room due to noisy neighbours and asked to be moved twice but reception advised us that they were fully booked, whilst the hotel may have been busy I struggle to believe it was full and reading between the lines think we were being told that no rooms at this tariff were available. We ate at Martin Wisharts and will review this separately but can say the best meal we had was in the Cameron Grill which also doubled as the breakfast room for a good start to the day. The bar at the hotel is great at night and also during the day for a chill out and read of the papers as you look out over the loch however the staff are laid back/no intrusive dependant on your point of view which for the price of the drinks I would have expected a more attentive level of service.

Great little hotel,"We stayed at the Regent Garden hotel in Paris in June 2012. On arrival we were warmly welcomed by the concierge and receptionist who was very patient with our attempts at speaking French. We arrived at 13:30 and our room was not ready but when we explained that we had a 15:00 appointment they speedily resolved the issue whilst we sat in the gardens enjoying a drink. As we ate out everyday in Paris I cannot comment on the breakfast other to say that other guests reported that it was good. The rooms in the Regent Gardens are a reasonable size by Paris standards but no overly large. The room is modern, bright and well appointed. We found the location ideal being 5-10 mins walk from the arc de triomphe with a supermarket opposite for those essentials.

Great place get there before its booked up,"I stayed here In May 2012 with my girlfriend, with the plan to have a relaxing city break.  Opera Hotel was not listed on trip adviser at the time of booking but after reviewing the website and getting some feedback on the location of the hotel from friends who live in the city, we decided to risk it.  That said, the price was such a good rate that even in the taxi on the way to the hotel from the airport, we were wondering if we were in for a rough ride! To be honest, we were really blown away.  The welcome from the staff was genuine and warm, check in very efficient and when we got to our corner suite, we couldn't believe our luck. The views of the bosphorous were second to none and the sound of the ship horns made for a authentic backdrop. The decor was great - modern and very clean.  Breakfast was lovely - plenty of choice and efficient.  The roof top bar is definitely worth  a visit with great views and nice decor, but lacking in atmosphere.  There were some things worth noting, but none which will spoil your experience; no iron in room was a surprise and inconvenient, although there is a laundry service provided (30tl for 5 items). The wifi was unpredictable and wouldn't allow access to uk website, but as with everything at Opera Hotel, you only need to ask and they will be happy to fix it for you (which they also did when our door wouldn't lock!). We stayed in room 204 which looks directly over the restaurant next door.  There is no noise, and we got used to it and the sea views more than compensated, but it was a surprise initially.

I find that the location on the mountain is not for me as it make Après difficult as you need to catch a cable car down to Lech, however this is a great location for a quiet couples break. The rooms at the Montana are o.k with everything you could need although not spectacular and as with the majority of hotels in Austria the beds are ""Austrian twins"" which are essentially a double bed which is not great when your sharing with a mate. The hotel staff are excellent and make your stay relaxed and attend to you every need. The Ortleib family own the property and are rightly proud of Patrick's Olympic and world gold medals which are displayed in reception and the bars area respectively. Meals at the Montana are great with plenty of breakfast options and evening meal being up to seven course of a high standard. Lunch on the terrace is great if the weather is sunny and if not make sure you get onto the heated bench seats just outside the hotel.

Good hotel but not without issues,"I stayed for 3 days in amsterdam over new year 2011/12 and chose the mint hotel as I have used them in the uk. We found out that the hotel had changed to the doubletree Hilton by chance as no communication was forthcoming from our booking agents. On arrival our room as not ready until 3pm (as stated on the website). Our luggage was kept and we returned later to get our room key. Initial impressions of our room on the 10th floor were that it was smaller than expected and that it was noisy as we were below the sky bar on the 11th floor, you can hear per walking around in heels and tables blowing moved. This is poor considering g how much we paid for the room so we rang reception and asked to be moved as the was a new years eves party due the next night unt 3am. The management said they would see what they could do for us. We came home later that night and they had moved us to the 9th floor and a far better room for which I think they deserve credit at a busy time of the year. I would say the worst part is checking in 20mins wait and checking out which was terrible in that there is no option to check out on your admittedly great apple tv. I had to queue for 35 mins to check out which was very poor and a
Lot of people were complaining, I would recommend that they ensure that all desks are staffed until they get the automated check out sorted. The staff vary from being really helpful or miserable but overall efficient.
I would recommend the Doubletree Hilton Amsterdam as a good hotel with great rooms available so long as you get the correct one, they also need some of the rough edges tidying up which I'm sure in time will happen...I would stay again.",December 2011,DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188590-d1946024-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Amsterdam_Centraal_Station-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",hotels,4.0,4.0
Stay Away Crystal should be ashamed,"The worst accommodation I have stayed in.......Crystal should be ashamed....they didn't even respond to our feedback forms...

I stayed here during a ski trip January 2011 in short it is a converted farm house which is not fit for purpose..

The food that greeted us on arrival was luke warm soup, the staff whilst never rude were totally incompetent...young staff just interested in getting out of there as soon as possible..like I said they were never rude just unable to cook, clean, have no idea about basic service standards or offer advise when asked questions.

We specified a room with a separate bathroom, what they didn't advise was that you had to be under 5ft tall to get into the bath due to the sloping roof above it the same goes for the toilet which you had to sit down. The rooms in general are of poor quality but what makes it worse is that they are not cleaned properly. The food as mention was so poor we ate out 3 nights even though fully catered and we could not believe that the staff were not embarrassed to serve the cooked breakfast it was that poor...the dining are is also so small that the staff cannot get around the table and neither can the guests..the crockery is tired and chipped...but you will not want to eat there anyway.
We were advised to avoid one of the bathrooms as ""the permanent residents"" use it and it's not great...which begs the question..why don't you clean it the?? (see photo)

In short I would not recommend this ""Chalet"" to anybody but those who just want to get smashed every night and don't care what soever about cleanliness or having food that is edible...

Good buget hotel,"I stayed here for 3 nights as part of a trekking tour and found it comfortable and pleasant. As some other reviewers have mentioned the rooms can vary considerably. My 1st night was on the 1st floor and not great with no air con and a view of next doors wall. But when I returned for 2 night at the end of my tour I stayed on the 4th floor and had a much greater experience with air con and great views of the city. I found the location fine but some may consider the 20 min walk to Thamel to far out, however we were walking to Everest Base camp so could hardly complain about a 20 jaunt. Nice roof top Garden and we found the food in the restaurant to be good although breakfast leaves a little to be desired.",March 2010,Hotel Tibet,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293890-d338255-Reviews-Hotel_Tibet-Kathmandu_Kathmandu_Valley_Bagmati_Zone_Central_Region.html,"Kathmandu, Nepal",hotels,3.0,4.5
Excellent Hotel,I stayed at the Hotel Steiner in January 08. I stayed for 4 nights for a short break and was thoroughly impressed with everything. From the moment you arrive and are personally greeted by Mr Steiner to the minute you leave and are each given Steiner Hotel Chocolate your stay is delightful. I have noted that other reviews have commented on the food not being up to standard but whilst not always to my taste I can honestly say that there was enough variety to select a nice meal. I was concerned about the size of the resort before I arrived bit found enough to keep me occupied and our group were lucky to have great conditions with fresh snow on 2 days.,January 2008,Hotel Steiner,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g190440-d267273-Reviews-Hotel_Steiner-Obertauern_Austrian_Alps.html,"Obertauern, Austria",hotels,4.0,4.5
Excellent Stay,"I stay at Legends for 3 nights during a trip to Australia to visit a friend in Melbourne. I travelled with my girlfriend and it was by far the best hotel we stayed in Australia. We had a sea view room but as others have commented, the hotel is behind other high rise property so you can only see the beach/sea in the gaps between buildings, but as we had not paid for a sea view this was not a problem for us. I found the hotel to be clean, the rooms spacious, with cooking facility in our room and friendly and would definitely go back there again. The location is superb being only a few blocks away from the action, but also far enough away to be peaceful when back at the hotel.
I would recommend this hotel to Friends and Family",November 2006,Mantra Legends Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255072-d256749-Reviews-Mantra_Legends_Hotel-Surfers_Paradise_Gold_Coast_Queensland.html,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",hotels,4.0,4.0
La Falaise Residence Avoriaz,"I have stayed here twice for long weekends snowboarding. the property is fairly basic but in a superb location. The rooms are basic but clean, we had the family room on the 1st floor last time and it was very spacious. The food at the hotel though is attrocious so I would suggest eating out as we did on our second visit.

Avoriaz itself offers excellent skiing / boarding and I would highly reccomend it although the nightlife in early January when I go is not great.

All in All a great resort and a good budget hotel.",January 2007,Pierre & Vacances Residence Saskia Falaise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562738-d586053-Reviews-Pierre_Vacances_Residence_Saskia_Falaise-Avoriaz_Morzine_Portes_du_Soleil_Haute_Savoie_.html,"Avoriaz, France",hotels,3.0,3.5
Chalet Altiport,"I spent a week in Alpe d'huez with AIRTOURS January 2007

This is my second time in the resort and it has great runs and plenty of variety. However I would NOT recommend going with AIRTOURS to Chalet Altiport, We booked for 9 people and had to take a triple room (for which we were charged extra) the rooms in the chalet Altiport are tiny and every door you open knocks into something like a bed and consequently does not fully open. The rooms are essentially single rooms with two beds in them or very small doubles, the triple room we had has bunk beds which may be o.k for the kids but not ideal for three 30+ yr old men.

The extractor fans in the toilets do not work in any off the rooms and when we reported this to the reps we were told to tell the chalet staff who advised the maintainance man who said that they have never worked since the chalet was built (not any use to us and in such a small room they needed to work!!).

I have to say though that the chalet staff Patrick and Jake are excellent, they were always helpful, fun and cooked good meals One other thing is that the chalet is out of the main resort, about 25-30 mins walk to the main bars which is o.k going there as its downhill but becomes a test of endurance on the way back when you have had a drink or three in sub zero conditions and its all uphill.

In closing I would recommend the resort, but not with AIRTOURS as after being shoe horned into my seat on the plane (the people in front of you are almost sat on your lap) and then sharing tiny rooms it's worth paying the difference staying in the main part of the village and going with a tour operator that provides better accomadation.",January 2007,Madame Vacances - Les Chalets de L'Altiport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g196704-d578223-Reviews-Madame_Vacances_Les_Chalets_de_L_Altiport-L_Alpe_d_Huez_Isere_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html,"L'Alpe-d'Huez, France",hotels,2.0,4.0
Excellent hotel,"Stay at the Movenpick July 2006 and can honestly say it is the best hotel I have stayed in - the location is second to none being just off main street but still quiet. security guards at every entrance ensure that you feel safe and the staff are all polite and helpful

I would gladly stay here again and hope to some day- superb hotel and staff",July 2006,Maritim Jolie Ville Resort & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297555-d301826-Reviews-Maritim_Jolie_Ville_Resort_Casino-Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html,"Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt",hotels,5.0,4.5
Europark 74,"I have just returned from Europark 74 and can confirm the Bates Motel is alive (or dead) and kicking in Belanmadena.

This place was either built or last refurbished in 1974 hence the name. The welcome you receive from reception (see picture) is less than warm as they have what appear to be 2 PITBULLS on a chain behind reception, think i'm joking see the attached pictures. You can be sure of you valuables being safe etc as they are guarded by the dogs so put your jewellery in there along with other guest sovereign rings, clown necklaces and hooped earrings the size of bird perches - unfortunately when you come to reclaim them, reception just get the contents of the safe out and ask you to take what is yours.

The room we stayed in was self catering and cheap £43 an night. It was decorated like a bad cliche of a 70's adult move but it was clean. The cooking facilities were a courtesy of portable stove. The locks on the front door have 4 bolts, presumably to keep Norman out when you are taking a shower, but not to worry as there are no locks on the balcony doors and the handles that close them are so flimsy (presumably being broken of several times) Norman will no doubt be able to enter unhampered from next doors balony.

The pool is pleasant even if some of the other guests like to loudly proclaim ""I fancy creating some carnage"" unfortunately a British Stag Do.

Would I recommend ""Europark 74"" ? Yes of course I would I will be sending my family there as soon as I need to collect my Inheritance.",July 2007,Europark 74 Aparthotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g562812-d577904-Reviews-Europark_74_Aparthotel-Benalmadena_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html,"Benalmadena, Spain",hotels,1.0,3.5
