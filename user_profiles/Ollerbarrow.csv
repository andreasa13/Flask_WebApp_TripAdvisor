Excellent £11.95 lunch,"A safe environment as far as distancing was concerned. A small, but nicely balanced lunch menu at a standard price of £11.95. The Squash risotto and the Chinese style noodle salad with pork were both great and a good size. Nice service in a very pleasant, relaxed, environment.

Great 'up market' Indian food with great service,"We took advantage of the Chancellor's 'Eat out to help out' offer and ate here a couple of weeks ago. Safety was well observed, the food was great and the service was first class, very friendly and efficient. Price wise it is about 50% more expensive than a 'standard' Indian restaurant, but offers a much nicer environment and way better service. Be aware that a service charge is added, as a routine. Around £35/head for two courses with a drink making it more of a 'special occasion' venue in our book.

The best place to watch the sun setting over the Petronus Towers,"A Strange combination of a swimming pool and a bar.

Not the best,"Maybe we didn't see this restaurant at its best, as we were part of a large group having dinner there. The ambience as you walk in, in the evening, is great and the Balinese construction really enticing.

The climb up to the temple of the sun at the top is something any responsible guide lets you take in bite-sized chunks as even pretty fit individuals can be seen puffing their way up the sometimes precarious steps.

Having said all of this there are some nice things to be bought in the area, including this stamped metal plaque of Buddha which costs us ฿200 (£5.50).",January 2020,Amulet Market,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293916-d8768930-Reviews-Amulet_Market-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",attractions,3.0,4.0
Good introduction to Thai culture - wear slip on shoes!,"A great primer of Thai culture – mostly air conditioned so a good place to go in the middle of the day. Great collections and well explained exhibits in a number of old Royal buildings. You need to remove your shoes a lot because you are either entering religious places or into somewhere with wooden floors, so slip on shoes are to be preferred. The Front Palace museum and the Funeral Chariot garages were our favourite places amongst the teens of different areas, but if your brain can cope with it you could spend all day here!",January 2020,The National Museum Bangkok,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293916-d311038-Reviews-The_National_Museum_Bangkok-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",attractions,4.0,4.0
Solid Gold experience,"This large temple, right behind the main Chinatown gate at the start of Yaorawat Road, boasts the largest solid gold Buddha in the world. It will cost you ฿40 to go and see it and a bit more if you want to explore the museum. The statue itself is a fascinating colour dependent upon the daylight, which comes in from three different aspects. Worth every penny to go and see (the museum was closed when we went).",January 2020,Temple of the Golden Buddha (Wat Traimit),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293916-d311046-Reviews-Temple_of_the_Golden_Buddha_Wat_Traimit-Bangkok.html,"Bangkok, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.5
Good as a temple at Sunset!,"Probably best seen as part of a guided tour. Is across the Chao Phraya from the Palace and the majority of the famous temple complexes and is a good place to finish your tour. Beautiful decorative porcelain work.

Great place to commune with Buddha,"Again probably best seen as part of a guided tour. The Ramayana is expertly painted, and in very good condition, in over 170 panels in a cloistered walkway; you either need to know the story or have it explained to you. There is loads of Hindu mythology in this area, which all surrounds the magnificent golden 'bot' that dominates the vicinity. The decoration on the surrounding buildings is stunning. Sit under the Bodhi tree, or look at the water lilies, and be absorbed by the Buddhist experience. The biggest disappointment is that you can't photograph the jade Buddha.

The things around it are better,"Probably best seen as part of a guided tour, otherwise seeing the various components in the right order, and with the right context will be difficult to achieve. We did our tour with Edo from Get your Guide tours; he was great even though his English was a little stilted. This was, however, quite an expensive tour (but included entry to the Palace, Wat Phra Kaeo, Wat Pho and Wat Arun as well as transportation and all entry fees), and is quite an endurance, lasting four and a half hours – water is provided, but you need sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat as well as your camera and, preferably, slip off shoes as you’ll be going in a lot of temples (Edo is an excellent photographer!).

"Buyer beware, especially the rides there and back!","It’s safe but there are plenty of people trying to entice you into the seedier side of Bangkok’s night life or take advantage of you if you let them – buyer beware. It’s also advisable to be conscious of the security of your valuables as there are loads of people, and every opportunity, to get your pockets picked. Virtually nothing that’s up for sale is the genuine article, and certainly not at the price you are first quoted, or even after a fair bit of haggling!

"Good, all round ramen joint","This seemingly inauspicious Japanese restaurant just down from Patpong market offers good rice and noodle dishes and has some specialities such as its Volcano Tonkotsu cooked in a granite bowl, which produces an effective ‘eruption’ when broth is poured into the magma chamber! At ฿950 (£13/head) for two large combination main meals (a main plus a side) and beers it was good value.

The breakfasts are great and we had exemplary service from the concierge, especially Boonmee Tangwong and his collegaues, who both guided us and organised our return taxi to Suvarnabhumi for ฿500 (around £14); this included the toll surcharge.

If you are into Hinduism you must go,"Like all Hindu temples this is incredibly welcoming and, if you are lucky, there is a pooja going on whilst you are there.

Don't miss the wonderful Nataraja on the right hand wall on your way out. Modesty garments are available but beware the astroturf at the shoe changing area if you are wearing socks and its rained.

Cosmopolitan and more organised than little India.,"The whole area of Kampong Glam radiates out from the Sultan Mosque. It is a short walk from Bugis and provides a different shopping experience from many other places in Singapore, with local food/spice/carpets and textiles all for sale.

A great way to get around - think before you buy the day cards,"We elected to get to our hotel from Changi airport by the MRT. It was bargain at $2.70 each from Terminal 2 to Bugis, changing at Tanah Merah; whichever terminal you arrive at there is a 'bus to the MRT'. I had read about the day cards but, to be honest if you are in a fairly central location you will walk a fair bit - we have spent around $12 over 3 days and the cheapest card for that period is $20 plus the $10 deposit for the NFC card (which is refundable). You can refill the card you get with your first journey and start getting discounts after 3 and 6 journeys, so unless you are going to be making a lot of journeys to the periphery of the system I'd think really hard before buying a mass transit ticket.",January 2020,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294265-d8016698-Reviews-Singapore_Mass_Rapid_Transit_SMRT-Singapore.html,"Singapore, Singapore",attractions,5.0,4.5
Ideally placed,"Described as an ‘Ultra-chic Boutique hotel’ – just can’t argue with that, it was fabulous. In a perfect central location adjacent to the Bugis MRT ($2.70 from Changi airport with a change across the platform at the same level at Tanah Merah) and all of the local shops. There are plenty of places to eat near by. It has a slightly strange conformation with the reception on the 2nd floor of the Duo tower block, with lifts up to the 25th floor for the communal areas, pool, bars and restaurants. A separate keycard activated lift then takes guests up to the floor their room is on. Brilliant rooms, comfortable bed with great WiFi and AC; ours had a fantastic city view looking down towards Marina Bay and across town. There is a bar, Mr. Stork, and observation deck on the 39th floor which affords great views of the whole of Singapore. The staff are very efficient and those in the restaurants are super helpful. Remon looked after us one night when we decided to take advantage of a special offer in the Alley on 25 – we had a really great evening overlooking the city as it got dark; thanks Remon!

Although the ragus, sugos, sauces were nice, to my taste there just wasn't enough of them to wow you into submission, hence my rating.
