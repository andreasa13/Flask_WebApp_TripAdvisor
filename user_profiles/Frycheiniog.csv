A great place to stay!,"We stayed here as a family. The rooms were comfortable, clean and air conditioned. Nothing was too much for the staff who were both friendly and helpful. I also felt safe which was great in a backpackers. The location is perfect with the beach and restaurants basically at your doorstep.

Child held against her will,"My tween went to purchase a small bag of candy that came to the insane amount of around 40 euro!! she did not have this much money. When she explained this he told her she could not put it back and she must pay even though she had explained she did not have the money. She stood there for a long time scared and eventually snuck away and left.
This is against the law and this fool should be fired. Very creepy person.",August 2020,Captain Candy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295371-d15187439-Reviews-Captain_Candy-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",attractions,1.0,2.5
Incredible look at ancient history,"Self done tour, no lines in winter. Cheap also. Amazing to see the art of ancient history, stone carvings and be educated on how things were made in those times. Also enjoyed the ancient village the museum is built on top of. This needs to be seen along with the Acropolis in my opinion.",January 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

A Must See!,It is truly a spectacular site to see ancient remnants of once magnificent temples. To consider what it would have taken to make them in those times is hard to fathom.

"Stunning scenery, healing spa but bad massage",The natural thermal spa is amazing. It does not take long to feel sublimely relaxed and the scenery is beautiful. Staff are slightly bossy as to where to place your things. To the point that it goes a bit far. The massage was terrible and I do not recommend it. Lovely snacks and drinks available.,February 2020,Therma Spa Mytilene,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g9681977-d9609732-Reviews-Therma_Spa_Mytilene-Larisos_Lesbos_Northeast_Aegean_Islands.html,"Lesbos, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
"Amazing staff, amazing views!!","I loved our experience here.
The staff are amazing. The gentleman in the lounge 32 looked after us and was fantastic.
The rooms are clean and lovely.
Maybe a little small and dated for the price but there are other things that make up for it for eg.
The view of Oprah house, Sydney harbour bridge and city is amazing. We also watched the fireworks over the harbour from our bed!
The food in the lounge and drink selection was fantastic... both breakfast and canapés and sweets.
We totally loved it here.",December 2017,Four Seasons Hotel Sydney,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255060-d256544-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html,"Sydney, Australia",hotels,5.0,4.5
DONT USE MENU ON FRIDGE!!,"Do not use the room service menu mantra provides through a company called gourmet deliveries
The food arrived cold!
Pizza looked like it had been dropped with topping falling of some of the pizza.
Receipt that was requested for work re-imbursememt was not given.
We called the company who told us they would check out what happened and call us back.
They never did!
Mantra if you are going to provide a service utilising another company then make sure they are not ripping people off.
Otherwise it takes your rating down.
Terrible room service experience and clearly the company not bothering to call us back suggests to me they do this a bit to customers.

Amazing history!,"I really enjoyed all the ruins.
The details in the some of the survived ruins is pretty amazing and the views over the city are spectacular.

"Natural, beautiful and unique","This place is so worth the trip!
Natural hot springs filled with minerals that are so good for your skin.
It's hot just like a bath and the surrounding scenery is beautiful!
We did not see the other hot springs in the area to compare but we chose this was one because of it being in natural surroundings.
I suggest you bring a picnic and some wine because I wish we did however, there is a little local eatery with great pizza and pasta.

Rustic surroundings.

Best pasta of my entire life!,"If you go to Pula you MUST go to this restaurant!
I had as an entree shared with my husband, a creamy truffle pasta.
Honestly it was the nicest pasta I've ever had!
This is really saying something because my favourite food in the world is ravioli so I've tried so many pastas especially all over Italy.
It shocked me to taste the most amazing in Croatia!
It was home made and so light.
I'm kicking myself for not taking a picture!!!!
The main meals were beautiful and everything so filling.
The waiter was great!
He quickly suggested a appetito of grappa and bluberries as it was a common Croatian before dinner drink.
Great suggestion and I had two ;)

Great history!,"What I really loved about this place is that it is not commercialised like many other similar historical structures over Europe.
Yes, you pay a reasonable fee to enter but i have visited in April and it felt like we had it almost to ourselves.
I love that you can see the pots and old kept tools etc. under the amphitheater without them being behind glass.

Disappointed,"Wow!
I could not believe how dissapointed I was in Venice (Venezia).
I had looked so forward to this place and it was stinky like dog pee, fish and stinky waters.
There were so many crooks trying to rip you off and many restaurants did not offer authentic food.
For eg. Packet made ravioli and gnocchi.
In one shop I asked for wifi and the guy picked up my phone from me and turned on my data roaming... yes seriously!! Shonky donkey people!
I travelled all over Italy and these people were the rudest and untrustworthy of all my experiences.

Leaning tower unique.. worth it!,"Sure worth a trip.
The buildings are amazing and the leaning tower is quite an experience to walk up.
Wear good shoes as the steps are worn from age and tourists.
The security is also very high there also.
You can also visit the church and baptistery in the same area.
Great little touristy markets surrounding also.
At the top of the tower you get to see the city and hear the bells ring.

Comfortable bed, beautiful garden scenery outside and the breakfast rocked!

The owners are such beautiful people and absolutely helpful in ever way they could.
They also do transfers to the city which was convenient.
The property has so much potential.
Our only negatives was the shower was blocked which we had at another place in Italy too and the towel rack fell off.

Pizza issues,"Usually we love Norfolk.
Locals for 8 years!
Two days ago be bought their takeaway pizza.
I arrived on time and our pizzas were ready but some non gentleman in the line that ordered his food decided to let all his mates in ahead of us waiting in the line and the lady at the register just let it happen.
After 20 mins!! Of their ordering and changing their minds, I think a few drinkies they had had were slowing the process down immensely!
Anyhow we finally got to pay for and pick up our pizza. It was greasy. The pizza box was wet and full of oil.
Probably from sitting too long. We threw it out.
Could I suggest a pizza line if you guys want to do takeaway. It's only between 5-6.
People do not like eating soggy, wet, cool food. After it waiting around for 20 mins.
The time before we ordered. We ordered three varieties of pizza and arrived home to fine 2 pizzas were the same.
I'm kind of giving up here.

Like old school camp cabins...YUK!,"My husband and I brought one if the vouchers last year. When we looked at the website it doesn't really show you the yucky cabin you are going to get so be warned!!
There are nicer more expensive cabins at this property but when we asked if we could pay for an upgrade it was already booked.
Our kitchen cupboards and windows were filthy. The couch so small as well as the tiny ancient tv. The spa bathroom is dark and actually a little bit scary not romantic. Bed uncomfortable. Horrible experience felt so ripped off. Sadly the lady who runs it is very lovely but without truthful advertisement I felt disappointed in her. We managed one night there and although we had paid too we left a night early.
She really needs to consider more accurate advertising because after bringing my parents all the way up from Victoria to get our first get away from our children as a couple in over a year at the time.
We felt stolen from! Don't go here unless you get their high end cabin!!
