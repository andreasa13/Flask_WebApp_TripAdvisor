Hot tub 1 lodge bliss,"Stayed in a new lodge with hot tub for 4 nights last week. We were the first people to use the lodge and we were very impressed. Fully fitted kitchen (apart from a microwave), 2 big TV s but no WiFi. Big double shower and nice dressing area. Hot tub on the balcony with take and chairs, dressing gown and slippers provided. Staff were very welcoming and very helpful. Will definitely be back.",April 2021,Ben Nevis Holiday Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186545-d1855017-Reviews-Ben_Nevis_Holiday_Park-Fort_William_Lochaber_Scottish_Highlands_Scotland.html,"Fort William, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Itison voucher,"Spent one night in kata 1 on an itison voucher given for Christmas. We were not disappointed, check in was fast and friendly, there was a basket full of wood and fire lighters for the stove inside that really heats up the tipi nicely. The bed was surprisingly comfortable, we just took our duvet and pillows which worked really well. We also had an outdoor compostable toilet which was very clean. The onsite shop was stocked well with lots of eco friendly products plus organic vegetables. All the kata sites were slightly different, we had a swing, fire pit and a bench. All crockery was provided along with saucepans. We had a great night and plan to return in the summer.",March 2020,Comrie Croft Eco Hostel & Camping,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g551797-d1201946-Reviews-Comrie_Croft_Eco_Hostel_Camping-Crieff_Perth_and_Kinross_Scotland.html,"Crieff, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,4.5
Relaxing drinks,"My husband and I went here for a beer after reading good reviews and we weren't disappointed. We sat in the beer garden and order a few beers which to be honest were quite expensive. There was an extensive cocktail list all about 10 euros each. We didn't eat so can't review the food. The service was brilliant and the setting was brilliant, only downside was ther courtyard doesn't catch the sun as its enclosed by buildings.",February 2020,six d.o.g.s,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3935963-Reviews-Six_d_o_g_s-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Overrated,My husband and I went here after reading great reviews and our experience wasn't the best to be honest. We were sat right next to the door and squeezed in with a cold draught. We ordered the special of chicken souvlaki which we waited nearly half an hour for. It was quite dry and the chips were overcooked unfortunately. We did tell the staff and they thanked us for the feedback. The service was great but unfortunately we wouldn't recommend this restaurant due to our experience. We ate in cheaper better restaurants.,February 2020,Bandiera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10445516-Reviews-Bandiera-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,5.0
Good experience,If you don't mind waiting for service and want to sit on the famous stairs for a lite bite and a coffee then this is the place for you. There's several cafes on the steps all identified by ther coloured umbrellas. We shared a caraffe of wine and soaked up the atmosphere.,February 2020,Yiasemi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1944626-Reviews-Yiasemi-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great food and service,"If your looking for a relaxed authentic greek experience then this is the place. The complimentary bread with olive paste was lovely as was the free dessert. Portions are huge and the wine tasty, the service was top notch and the yard out the back is very cosy. We tried to go back here but it was shut on our last day unfortunately. Would highly recommend.",March 2020,Efcharis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d4746098-Reviews-Efcharis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Authentic experience,"I went here with my husband after reading reviews on here and we weren't disappointed. We were greeted with great hospitality from the owners, he showed us videos on the iPad of the wines we were trying and explained where they were from. It was 14euro to try 3 wines which were large enough for both of us, we had the large platter of meat and cheeses (all from Greece) which we also explained to us. We had a great experience and would highly recommend a visit whilst in Athens.",February 2020,Cinque Wine & Deli Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d9462540-Reviews-Cinque_Wine_Deli_Bar-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Disappointing,For such a great site and such an ancient temple I was very disappointed in the lack of information. I sat and googled it to get some history of the temple and to try get an idea of what it may have looked like in its time. They really need to give you a leaflet or provide more information boards as it's full of history and quite sad with the lack of information. Having send that its it's a beautiful site.,February 2020,Temple of Olympian Zeus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d242844-Reviews-Temple_of_Olympian_Zeus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.0

It's okay.,"Went here on our last day and they do have some great pieces to look at, I felt that it could have been done slightly better with more interactive exhibitions. We spent about 3 hours here and that's with reading everything.",February 2020,National Archaeological Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198713-Reviews-National_Archaeological_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Great place to hang out.,You will probably pay a bit extra to shop here but the atmosphere and variety are great.

Not to be missed when in Athens,"I was pleasantly surprised by the stadium, you have an audio guide to guide you around the stadium which is beautiful. Make sure to sit in the VIP seats! You can walk up the tunnel where athletes walked to start there race, stand on the podium and pretend you've won a race. The views from the cheap seats over to the acropolis are fantastic. For 5 euros it's a great place to spend a few hours.",February 2020,Panathenaic Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245991-Reviews-Panathenaic_Stadium-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Need a guide and some time,"The site is amazing and you really need time to read all the information plaques and make sure you search everywhere. The parthenon is being refurbished at the moment but you can still see and get good photos. It's cold and very windy up there sho make sure you wear the right clothing. The floor is also uneven so wear decent footwear! Walk around the base of the acropolis to see the hidden caves and the fountain. The views are great from the top. We went twice, once with a guide and then again so we could read all the boards and explore more.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Need a guide,Museum was very interesting but as with most sites in Athens you need a guide to lead you around. We enjoyed going underneath to see the archaeological site.

Great service and good food.,"We stumbled upon this cafe when ther one next for was shut, we had Chicken Gyros and the special which were both very good and well priced andi extremely large portions.

Cosy atmosphere,"I love brewdog and this new one is cute. It's hard to get a seat but well worth the wait. The staff are very attentive letting you try samples.

Brisk walk,"Great for everyone here whether you just want to go check the turbines out or go on a 8 mile hike. They have a very informative visitors centre echo sill equip you with a walking map and give you information on the history of the turbines. There's a lovely cafe serving soup and sandwiches. I did the 8 mile loch walk and it was stunning, walking by many a turbine and the loch then through which felt like a Christmas tree farm.

Outstanding,"Trevi mountain is outstanding! The best site in Rome in my opinion, we went back three times, go at night to see it lit up. There are pick pickets around so watch your belongings. It's very busy and hard to find a quiet moment but I recommend doing it as part of a tour to get the history. We did a free walking tour which this was part of.",August 2019,Trevi Fountain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d190131-Reviews-Trevi_Fountain-Rome_Lazio.html,"Rome, Italy",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Breathtaking, guided tour recommended","We pre booked the English guided tour which enabled us to skip the line which was quite long. Fors for the tour were you got to know the history of the Coliseum and hear stories, against's would be that you don't get any free time to wonder about and explore which I would have liked.

Good honest italien grub,"We went here as a family of three after walking around Trastevere. The food is great value for money and very tasty, we had gnocchi and lasagne for main which was amazing and tiramisu for dessert which was amazing. There was also entertainment whilst we were eating.

Great pub overnight stay,"We stayed in the singe and double room with shared bathroom, the rooms were small but comfortable, the bathroom was a good size and clean and modern. The bed was too firm for me but that's my preference. We had a lovely pub meal, all fresh ingredients and priced very reasonably. There was an excellent gin selection too! Breakfast was a locally sourced cooked meal with toast. Not too far from Perth either.",August 2018,Bankfoot Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1312736-d1308903-Reviews-Bankfoot_Inn-Bankfoot_Perth_and_Kinross_Scotland.html,"Bankfoot, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.5
