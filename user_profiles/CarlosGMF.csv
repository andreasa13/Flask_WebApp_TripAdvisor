A mid-morning snack,"Had a mid-morning snack waiting for a friend. I tried a green detox smoothie, a chocolate dessert and to drink hot chocolate. All were excellent and well presented.

Thoroughly disappointing!!,"If you are looking for Hindu flavor and good service, keep looking elsewhere. We ordered a plate that was supposedly for two, curry flavored seafood. Due to coronavirus, the restaurant only has delivery. After 2:15 of wait time the food finally arrived. And unfortunately it was not worth the wait. The portion size was for one person, barely, but priced for three or four. The taste was barely recognizable Hindu, the nana bread was terrible, and the dessert had a foul taste. It has to be one of the worst dining experience of my life. Thoroughly disappointing ls an understatement. Definitely won’t be trying this place ever again.",April 2020,Tikka Masala,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g292006-d15286935-Reviews-Tikka_Masala-Guatemala_City_Guatemala_Department.html,"Guatemala City, Guatemala",restaurants,2.0,5.0

Octupus tacos!! (You read that right),"Recently opened bar, very well located within walking distance of all major hotels in Zone 10.

Nice place and service....,"The restaurant is in the Oakland Mall Rooftop area, very nice and excellent for people watching.

The environment is very local, and you will find mostly locals here. They have a full-service bar and the selection is good.

Ribs are good....that's about it,"Restaurant has really good ribs most of the time, but sometimes they run out and must source from a different supplier. This makes for an inconsistent experience.

A bit unorganized,"Went last night with my kids for dinner. The attendant was aloof, and his explanations were not at all helpful. It seemed it was a pain to be explaining the ropes of the new place....we finally ordered and then found no place to sit, as all tables were taken up by large groups just hanging out. We found a place out in the cold next to a fire, which kept us a bit warm. However, the burgers, a chicken sandwich, and grilled cheese we ordered were really good.

Nice italian little restaurant,"Had a nice time at this place. The service was very good, and menu selection was ok. I had lamb chops with a side of mashed potatoes. The sides are enormous.

Magnificent!,"Rendez Vous just recently opened its new location, and the place is just amazing. The service which has always been superior now is coupled by a beautifully decorated environment, with lots of light and outdoorsy feel. As usual, any of the plates are exquisite. This last lunch, I had the green pepper steak, and a ""chico"" mousse. An herbal tea (I had the red one) will be a great closing for a great lunch or dinner.

Amazng service!,"We got to the restaurant right at the time of closing, but the waiter told us they would serve us. Not only did he provide us with service, he provided us with exceptional service. We had salads and a large pan pizza which came promptly and with great taste. Even though they were cleaning the restaurant to go home, they went out of their way to ensure we did not feel rushed.

Budget place just for resting,"We stayed seven nights at the Seralago. The rate was amazingly low, and it shows. The room was clean, but with strong humidity odor.
