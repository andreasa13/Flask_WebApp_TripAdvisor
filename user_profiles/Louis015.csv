Great way to get to the airport.,We scheduled our ride with Aris the evening before we left and our driver was on time and had a vehicle that was big enough for the three of us and our luggage. It was also a very comfortable vehicle.,September 2019,My Athens Transfers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d9846275-Reviews-My_Athens_Transfers-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Wonderful place to visit,It is amazing that things have been there this long. It is very crowded and you need to be very careful because the walkway is mostly old marble stones and very slippery.,September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice new museum,The museum is very large and you really needs a guide to enjoy it. There is some much there but unless you are very knowledgeable about the local history it is overwhelming. It is also very crowded.,September 2019,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,3.0,4.5
Nice Hotel,The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was good but expensive. The view from the roof restaurant was beautiful at night but partially blocked.

Great way to see Athens in a day,Stavros was our driver and he was great. He was on time to pick us up and was very informative.

Very Convenient,We had all day to kill time in Tampa and it was rainy and a Sunday but we found out that the Tampa Airport Marriott has a day rate that is good up until 6PM. So we had a room with 2 beds and a view of the planes on the runways and a TV and Wifi plus we were right at the airport so we could keep track of our flight and it was very easy to check-in from where we were.,February 2018,Tampa Airport Marriott,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34678-d85906-Reviews-Tampa_Airport_Marriott-Tampa_Florida.html,"Tampa, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.5
I couldn't believe my eyes,We were at the airport and looking for a place to eat lunch when we saw the Hard Rock.

Great Location but TINY bathroom,The hotel is located in a great location and the room was clean and comfortable but the bathroom should be in a TINY house. There was nowhere to put anything on the sink and the shower had a shower curtain because there wouldn't have been room for the toilet if it had walls. The outside noise came right trough the windows and doors and it is a noisy area. But overall it really wasn't too bad.,August 2017,Hotel Union Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81520-Reviews-Hotel_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",hotels,3.0,4.0
Good food at a reasonable price,The restaurant is not a typical looking place but the food is good and the prices are reasonable. I ate both breakfast and dinner at the restaurant and was happy with the food and the service. I would consider this a good place to eat. It is not fancy but good.,August 2017,Tad's Steakhouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d378168-Reviews-Tad_s_Steakhouse-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"It wil do,",The hotel room we had was decorated in the Modern Motif but it seemed like it was from the 60's. The carpet was clean but showed wear. The beds were comfortable and it had a minifidge. The biggest drawback was the center courtyard was noisy and right outside of our window and we didn't have air-conditioning so we kept the window open.,August 2017,Americania Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d119625-Reviews-Americania_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",hotels,3.0,3.5
Interesting,It has lots of trails and access to the beach but remember what goes down must come back up. We were there looking for a Parakeet Auklet which had been spotted by several birders and is not common to the area.,August 2017,Lands End,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60713-d117409-Reviews-Lands_End-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",attractions,4.0,4.5
Nice place to stay,The hotel is well located and the staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was included and the patio was a great place to eat. The room was large and the bathroom was up to date. The only problem was the room felt like it was concrete and the lounge chair needed to be replaced.,June 2017,Hotel Sant'Antonin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187870-d5773615-Reviews-Hotel_Sant_Antonin-Venice_Veneto.html,"Venice, Italy",hotels,3.0,4.5
"Excellent location, close to everything.","The hotel is very close to sightseeing, entertainment and restaurants. The underground is just steps away which makes everything so convenient. The hotel accommodations were very comfortable and clean. The elevator or lift was a bit small so it took a little doing to get our luggage and everyone to the room. There bathroom was also a bit small and the low water toilets didn't work as well as they should have but was useable.
They have a machine on each floor that dispenses filtered water which was nice.",May 2017,The Grand at Trafalgar Square,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186338-d677369-Reviews-The_Grand_at_Trafalgar_Square-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",hotels,4.0,4.0
Good for the business traveler,"The hotel is not pretty or modern but it has everything the business traveler needs. They have a shuttle that will take you to and from the airport, they have a business center, a workout room, an indoor pool, WiFi and even a feed from the airport with the departures.
They also have a bar and a restaurant. I found the bathroom very small and the room had too much furniture for its size. I also didn't like the storage for your clothes including the hanging clothes.",April 2017,Four Points by Sheraton Mall of America Minneapolis Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g43460-d95647-Reviews-Four_Points_by_Sheraton_Mall_of_America_Minneapolis_Airport-Richfield_Minnesota.html,"Richfield, Minnesota",hotels,4.0,4.0
Lots of Birders,This is the closest place for people going to High Island for bird watching that is decent. The room comfortable but nothing outstanding.

Good burger,The food is good but the wait for your food is long and very limited seating in the restaurant. There is also limited parking but it is worth the effort.,December 2015,Get The Burger,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2018261-d2546326-Reviews-Get_The_Burger-Big_Bear_Lake_Big_Bear_Region_California.html,"Big Bear Lake, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great Location,The hotel is located on one of the main streets and the subway (train) is located just outside of the hotel. The rooms are typical European style with hardwood floors and Ikea style furniture. The room was for three people so we had two single beds and a fold out sofa. The breakfast was not included and I did not think it was worth the price. There were cafes very close by with much better food and much cheaper. The hotel had a very nice pool on the roof with a great view of the cit.,July 2015,Hotel Barcelona Universal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187497-d230643-Reviews-Hotel_Barcelona_Universal-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",hotels,4.0,4.5

A little disappointing,I guess that Flamenco in Catalonia is different from the south of Spain. It was very Gypsy like and not what I expected. It was also a very small and very crowded theater.,July 2015,Tablao Flamenco Cordobes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d1725621-Reviews-Tablao_Flamenco_Cordobes-Barcelona_Catalonia.html,"Barcelona, Spain",attractions,3.0,4.5

The rooms were nice.,I liked the room but the hotel check-in was very slow. The self parking is a long walk back to the hotel elevators. When you check into the hotel you have to walk through the casino to go anywhere. There are all kinds of stores in the casino area but the prices are very high as well as the price for the Carnival Buffet.,May 2015,Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g45963-d91673-Reviews-Rio_All_Suite_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",hotels,4.0,3.5
Highly Over Rated,"The location is in a questionable neighborhood, beds are uncomfortable and the lay out of the room is strange, the toilet is in a very small room next the the door.

Great Location and Very Helpful Staff,"The room was comfortable and clean but the bathroom I thought was a little small and I prefer a separate shower instead of an all in one combination. The beds were comfortable and you had both foam and down pillows. The lobby area was nice but laid out a little strange. The seating area was behind a wall or a divider.

Needs an upgrade,"The bowl is a beautiful place but it needs to be updated. The seats are hard and uncomfortable. The access is very cramped. The entertainment is great, the L.A.

Loved it and would do it again,"The location was great because it was not in the tourist area so you felt like it was the real Costa Rica. You will need a car to get around. The accomodations were good, two bedroom on the second floor. We had a full kitchen but did not have a dish washer. The staff was very nice and very helpful. We joined the activities doing Zip Line, White Water Rafting, Manuel Antonio National Park and bird watching. We also went to the resaurant across the road for a typical Costa Rican diner one night and a bar-b-que another night. The pool was nice and had a swim up bar with Happy Hour from 3:30 to 5:30 every night. We met a lot of nice families from all over the US at the timeshare and enjoyed their company. The maids came in and took out the trash every day and changed the linen in the middle of the week. I only had two minor compaints. You couldn't regulate the hot water very well and the shower in the second bedroom had very poor water pressure.

Very Good Stay,The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The food at the restaurant very very good and not to highly priced. The room was good sized but didn't have much of a view even though we were on the 18th floor. It is located within walking distance to downtown Seattle but it is hilly. The only complaint I had was that the towel in the bathroom were like sandpaper.

Very Comfortable,The hotel is about 2 blocks from the central train station so it is easy to get to. They were very accommodating when we showed up early in the morning because our flight arrived at 8 AM. We couldn't get into the room until 1PM but they did store our luggage until then. The room was very comfortable and modern. The only negative was the bathroom fixtures should be updated to a more modern style.

Could be better.,The room was small and the furniture looked like it came from IKEA. The bath room looked like one on a cruise ship. The location was close to the center of Amsterdam but the street where the hotel was located was kind of run down. We had the breakfast included in our package and it had a good variety and was worth the money.,June 2012,Ibis Amsterdam Centre Stopera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188590-d231324-Reviews-Ibis_Amsterdam_Centre_Stopera-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",hotels,3.0,4.0
Not what I was hoping,"The location is 2 blocks from the Copacabana Beach but it was the bare minimum that you would want. The bathroom had Kleenex or glass for brushing your teeth.

The restaurant is buffet style.",March 2012,Hotel Mar Palace Copacabana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g303506-d536032-Reviews-Hotel_Mar_Palace_Copacabana-Rio_de_Janeiro_State_of_Rio_de_Janeiro.html,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",hotels,2.0,4.0
"Great Location, Poor Management",We reserved 3 rooms and every room had at least one problem. Upon arrival I was given my keys but when I opened the door the room was not made and it was early evening. The other two rooms had mold in the coffee pots and I had a water stain on one of the beds from the sprinkler over head. We tried to separate the bills for expense reports and it took three people two days to almost get it straight. I will say the food in the dining room was good and the setting of the lodge is beautiful but has inadequate lighting on the pathways between buildings.,November 2011,Wuksachi Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g143050-d145719-Reviews-Wuksachi_Lodge-Sequoia_and_Kings_Canyon_National_Park_California.html,"Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park, California",hotels,2.0,4.0
