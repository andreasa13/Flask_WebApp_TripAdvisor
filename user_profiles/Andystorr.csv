Well worth a visit,"Popped along with my camera in the hope of getting some great photos of the murals, and I wasn’t disappointed.

In addition to being colourful & visually stunning, many of them (as you’d expect) are also conceptually brilliant. You quickly get totally absorbed in the experience as you wander along the section of the wall.

If you are hoping to get some good unspoilt front-on photos of the more popular murals I would suggest going along before the tour groups start to appear, unless you like random people obscuring key bits of each picture ... and get someone to watch your back as you occasionally have to leave the safety of the pavement to get a wide enough angle.

Well worth deviating from the usual central city attractions for an hour or so to see this marvellous piece of modern political art.",May 2019,East Side Gallery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d191041-Reviews-East_Side_Gallery-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,4.0,4.5
OK,"Popped in to pass a bit of time before a river cruise and had an interesting hour wandering around all the “hands on” exhibits, including mock ups of the interior of high-rise flats ... and a lift.

If I’m honest, apart from a few informative items on show outlining the ideology that led to the separation of the city, most of the museum (and I’m thinking mainly of the lifestyle exhibits) reminded me more of growing up in the 1970’s in the UK than any alternative political system !

OK,"Popped up to the observation deck to kill a bit of time before getting the bus to the airport, and I guess I’m glad I did although it was nothing special.

It’s exactly what you expect from an elevated observation deck above a city.

If you have the time, and €16 to spare, it’s probably worth doing but if you’ve already seen a fair bit of the city on the ground then you won’t really be missing much if you don’t get the chance.",May 2019,Berliner Fernsehturm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d190589-Reviews-Berliner_Fernsehturm-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,3.0,4.0
Don’t miss it,"Popped along to this as part of a group of friends during the serious “cultural” part of a stag weekend.

We were all hugely impressed by the site, both the exterior designer monument (a series of independent irregular blocks which make for a hugely impressive visual experience) and the underground visitor centre, which chronicles the events leading up to the holocaust and the individual accounts of victims (via reproductions of letters). I’m not ashamed to say that one of the letters from a 12 year old girl left me with a tear in my eye.

"Good, clean, modern hotel","Stayed in a twin room as part of a large stag weekend party and had a perfectly pleasant stay.

The hotel was clean, modern and the front counter staff were professional & friendly. They also spoke excellent English.

The breakfast buffet options were wide & varied as you’d expect in a large hotel of this type.

The location was also fine, just 5 mins from Alexanderplatz and close to the bus stop for Tegel airport.

It’s hard to find fault with it, and I’d definitely stay there again, although I’d try to make sure that I had a room that didn’t face out onto the main street, as I stayed an extra night in a different room and noticed that it was noticeably more noisy than the room I’d previously been in.",May 2019,H4 Hotel Berlin Alexanderplatz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187323-d1857196-Reviews-H4_Hotel_Berlin_Alexanderplatz-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",hotels,4.0,4.0
A fun night,"Went along to the late show commencing after midnight as part of an eight person stag weekend, and had a really good night.

The venue is really small, seating around 40 people maximum and the stage was tiny. This gave it a very intimate atmosphere which really added to the experience.

Basically it consists of about five girls and one bloke who pretty much do everything, from welcoming guests, serving behind the bar, mingling, waiting on tables, performing on stage, washing up & cleaning ! Each one appears to take their turn at each task.

The show was divided into three sections each consisting of about four 5-minute acts, with long drinks intervals in between each section when the performers return to their more basic bar duties & mingling.

There’s plenty of nudity in the acts, but not in a vulgar way.

The audience was a mixture of two lads groups (inc ours), a group of young girls, and several older couples ... so it has quite a wide appeal.

The performers were also really chatty and approachable, which made the evening all the more memorable.

Thoroughly recommended for a fun couple of hours.",May 2019,Kleine Nachtrevue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d190600-Reviews-Kleine_Nachtrevue-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,4.0,4.0
Very interesting ... especially the guided tour,"I didn’t really know quite what to expect when I added this venue to my “to do” list of sites to visit. It turned out to be probably the most informative of the historical locations I attended over the weekend.

The large modern visitor centre is based on the site of some old Nazi government buildings from where control was exercised, and is full of informative notice boards separated into different historical & functional aspects of the Nazi party’s rise and hold on power.

Whilst the information on show was extremely interesting in itself, I joined in one of the free guided tours in English and over the next 90 mins the guide brilliantly brought the exhibition to life, focussing on what was really going on behind the factual information presented.

I’m not sure how frequent the English guided tours are. I was just in the right place at the right time by accident, but I would definitely try to latch onto one if at all possible.",May 2019,Topography of Terror,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187323-d190535-Reviews-Topography_of_Terror-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",attractions,4.0,4.5
Bland steak,"Popped in for dinner on a quiet Monday night.

As a massive steak fan with a trip round Argentina under my belt I opted for the rib-eye done rare, usually one of the tastiest options.

The steak I was served barely had any taste at all, and nor did the potato wedges I ordered as an accompaniment.

The wine options were also very limited and the Argentinian red I ordered was very ordinary.

The service was prompt & friendly, and the interior decor was pleasant enough, but these were the only positive aspects of my evening.

Not recommended if you are looking for a quality meal.",May 2019,Las Malvinas - Steakhaus Restaurant Berlin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d2330249-Reviews-Las_Malvinas_Steakhaus_Restaurant_Berlin-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",restaurants,2.0,4.0
Amazing food,"Visited this restaurant on a Saturday evening as part of a group of 8 friends celebrating an occasion, and ordered the four course set menu for €44.

Although it was a lovely evening and all the outside tables were full, there were plenty of unoccupied tables inside and we were given one of these.

What I got was way beyond my expectations. Each of the dishes was extremely well flavoured, beautifully presented, and served with consumate professionalism by the pleasant waiting staff.

The four courses took the best part of 3.5 hours to serve up. I’m not sure if this unhurried approach was deliberate to encourage us to consume the copious quantities of wine & water that we ended up doing, but even if it was we didn’t mind as it was appropriate in the circumstances.

In the end the final bill came to €80 each, and we were all more than happy to pay this given the sheer quality of the food & wine.

I rarely give 5 stars, but I had no hesitation in this case.",May 2019,Balthazar Spreeufer 2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187323-d8834591-Reviews-Balthazar_Spreeufer_2-Berlin.html,"Berlin, Germany",restaurants,5.0,4.5
"Comfortable, clean hotel in a very handy location.","Stayed here on & off for two weeks (in between separate visits to other areas of Greece) and used it as a base to explore Athens.

It’s a large multi-floor hotel near Syntagma Square, which is one of the focal metro transport hubs of the city. It was 5 mins away from an area of restaurants and 10 mins from the centre of Plaka.

The hotel was very professionally run, spotlessly clean & functional. I had three separate rooms during my stay and all were near identical and extremely comfortable.

The self-service buffet breakfast was exceptional, with every possible option catered for.

I would definitely stay here again if I returned to Athens.",March 2019,Amalia Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d233049-Reviews-Amalia_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,4.5
Excellent choice,"Stayed here for three nights to visit the ruins.

Upon arrival I was warmly greeted by the owner, Damiano, who continued to be an accessible, informative and friendly host throughout my stay.

The hotel was clean & contained all the amenities you’d expect from one of its class. I think that every room has a narrow balcony (mine certainly did) although it wasn’t quite warm enough in March to spend much time on it during my visit.

The communal area/breakfast room was a nice pleasant place to relax & pick Damiano’s brains re restaurant recommendations (& chat politics !).

My only gripe would be quality of the shower in my room (5) which was a bit more basic than I’d have expected. The shower curtain set-up had seen better days and it was impossible not to flood the bathroom floor each time you used it !

The location of the hotel was perfect. It was situated one street away from the main street (and hence probably wouldn’t be exposed to the street noise in busy times) and at the ruins end of the town (10 mins walk to the entrance). It was also a couple of doors away from possibly the best restaurant in town.

An absolute gem !,"Decided to try this place for dinner on a Sunday night as it looked quite interesting.

It’s a trendy greengrocer, butcher, wine shop with a restaurant at the entrance ... but what a restaurant !!!

I didn’t quite know what to expect in terms of food quality given the quirky setting, but I was blown away by what I got. This is only the 2nd 5-star review I’ve given in my two week trip, but it was thoroughly deserved.

The menu hints at a high level of class. I had the sweet & spicy stuffed peppers for starter, and the pork & beef ragù for main course. Both dishes had been beautifully prepared and were bursting with flavour. I’d have been delighted if I’d have been served this food in an expensive high class restaurant, but to receive it in a place where people were browsing the shelves for their weekly fruit & veg was a very pleasant surprise indeed !

I don’t know whether the novelty of combining the two environments will work (hope it does) but this place is worth a visit for the dining experience alone.

Very good,"Decided to give this place a try as I was in the local area at lunchtime and it rated highly in TripAdvisor.

The service was really friendly, with the waiter explaining a couple of unfamiliar dishes to me in perfect English.

The food was also really good, although my only criticism is that the starter & main course turned up at the same time, which meant that I had to rush the former so that my main didn’t get cold.

The cost was also quite reasonable, and I can completely understand why this place is highly rated (although no.19 in the whole of Athens ... probably not that high !).

Reasonable,"Popped in on a busy Saturday night. The interior was full but the seating outside was free and the heat lamps made the outdoor dining bearable.

I had a chilli con carne starter and a chicken fajita main course. Both were fine and served the purpose of getting rid of my hunger.

The waitresses were rushed off their feet but service was still OK. The bill wasn’t too bad either.

Overall ... it’s a themed restaurant which serves up reasonable food at acceptable prices.",March 2019,Mamacita - Taqueria y Cocteleria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d14168019-Reviews-Mamacita_Taqueria_y_Cocteleria-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Good inexpensive Greek food & friendly service,"Popped in for lunch based on all the TripAdvisor 5-star reviews.

The menu had a good wide selection of traditional Greek dishes & other cuisines (inc burgers, pizzas etc).

The restaurant, which is tucked away down a side street, appeared to be quite small, with only around half a dozen tables. As we were still in March, and the weather a little unpredictable, the tables were protected by a temporary tent. I’m not sure if there was an another dining area as well ?

Service was very good, with the charismatic owner explaining how the bread was “home-made” and the oil local “Olympian”. He also spoke perfect English.

The food itself was good quality. I had the lemon hummus (with the aforementioned home-made bread) for starter, followed by the spicy meatballs in tomato sauce. Both dishes were very nice indeed.

Two courses, with a can of Coke, came to just €17 which I was fine with.

I don’t think it quite merited 5 stars as I’ve had better meals on the trip, but it was a solid 4 stars and I thoroughly recommend paying it a visit.",March 2019,Pheidias Grill House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189487-d14997068-Reviews-Pheidias_Grill_House-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Good quality inexpensive Greek food,"Went along for dinner on a Thursday evening on the recommendation of my hotel owner.

The interior is fairly basic which gives it a nice authentic local non-touristy feel. The menu was similarly basic & authentic, but there were still plenty of options, including a couple of pasta & mincemeat dishes that I hadn’t seen elsewhere.

The restaurant was about half full, split pretty evenly between foreign tourists & Greeks (possibly locals).

The quality of the food was good, and the service (by the poor young girl who had to manage the busy floor all on her own) was really good. She spoke excellent English and was able to explain the unfamiliar dishes to me.

I also had a half-litre of the local red wine, which was nice apart from the fact that it had come straight out of the fridge ! This isn’t the first time that I’ve been served cold red wine on my trip around Greece and I wonder if it’s a normal practice ?

Two courses, wine & a coffee came to €17 which I was very happy with.

Good food & excellent value,"Popped in for lunch and was warmly greeted.

The menu was fairly basic, but all the main dishes were there ... and the prices were really good too.

I needn’t have worried about the quality of the food, as it was very tasty and the portion sizes were generous.

I had the tsatziki (starter) & kebab (main), and with a can of Coke the bill came to under €15 (with a complimentary dessert thrown in).

Fascinating,"Very small private “museum” containing modern working replicas & background information on Archimedes’ many inventions, and there were many more of them than I’d known about.

Although Archimedes himself hailed from elsewhere (Syracuse) the founder of the museum (a huge Archimedes fan) is a local and hence the reason for this dedicated venue in Olympia.

The staff (a couple of young girls when I visited) spoke excellent English and were knowledgeable enough to answer some basic questions.

"Top quality food, but expensive","Popped in for dinner on a quiet Tuesday night. I was the only diner for the entire time I was there, but this probably had more to do with the midweek evening & out-of-season time of the year than anything else.

I hadn’t done my research very well and it was only when I opened the menu that I realised that this was a slightly more expensive fine-dining restaurant, rather than the routine Greek cuisine places I’d been used to on my trip thus far.

I can’t remember the name of my starter, but it was pretty much a small pizza (definitely not described as pizza in the menu). It was full of interesting flavours and very tasty indeed.

For the main course I chose the slow-cooked lamb, and this was simply delicious. It was done in a “egg-lemon” sauce which really worked well.

The service was overly-attentive, probably because it was empty apart from me, but it was professional and friendly.

The only thing that stops me giving 5 stars is the cost. It wasn’t cheap. For the two courses and a Greek coffee to round things off the bill came to just under €40 !

However, if you are looking for excellent food in a very pleasant setting, and cost isn’t an issue, then I’d thoroughly recommend this restaurant.",March 2019,Mono Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d2275336-Reviews-Mono_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
My first 5-star rating of the trip !,"Popped in for dinner on the recommendation of the hotel owner, and what a good recommendation it was !

Although the restaurant has copious meat dishes as well, it’s pretty clear from the menu that it’s focus is on seafood.

I went for a grilled sardine main after a roasted feta starter. Both courses were simply superb. I also had a carafe of the house red (very drinkable) and a Greek coffee to round things off ... all for €20 (with a complimentary dessert thrown in) !

Despite it being a drizzly Wednesday evening in late March (ie well out of season) the place was almost full, which says a great deal.

I don’t give 5 stars easily, but for the combination of food quality, value for money, and professional, unfussy service the accolade was richly deserved.",March 2019,Taverna Orestis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189487-d10283105-Reviews-Taverna_Orestis-Olympia_Elis_Region_West_Greece.html,"Olympia, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Very busy with locals,"Decided to pay this place a visit for a mid-afternoon snack to see it the very good reviews were justified.

The interior (which is tiny) and the area outside were both full of people seemingly just waiting for something. There was no obvious queue or any sense of order at all and I was a bit unsure how to go about actually ordering food.

After a few seconds of dithering I decided to push past the people hanging around in the doorway and was ready with my apologies if that was considered to be pushing in. I was initially ignored by the lady who was serving at the counter but after a minute or so she caught my eye and asked what I’d like, making a quick mental note of my answer (there aren’t many options !) and carrying on with her frantic activity.

I then watched for about 15-20 mins whilst the young chap at the grill (Kostas junior ?) churned out souvlaki in pitta bread again & again as if on a factory production line and handed each one to the lady at the serving counter. At this point the process became clear ... the serving order was all in her head. Despite the fact that there was no queue whatsoever, she knew exactly who was next to be served and what they wanted, even though they’d spoken to her for about 5 seconds, 20 minutes ago ! I was impressed, particularly as some customers had even wandered halfway up the road whilst waiting and had to be summoned back with a bell !

Was the food worth the wait ? I quite enjoyed the novelty of working out what was going on but I’m not sure I’d put up with the disorganised ordering process again. The souvlaki in pitta was good, but nothing exceptional. It was quite cheap I guess (€2.30) but as I subsequently found out that’s pretty much the market rate anyway.",March 2019,O Kostas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1092578-Reviews-O_Kostas-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Excellent value for money,"Popped in for lunch after a busy morning of sightseeing. I noted that it was quite highly rated on TripAdvisor so I thought I’d give it a try.

It’s got a very basic interior, a bit like a local cafe, and I was worried that the food would match the surroundings rather than the reviews (I often find that if food is cheap but edible it gets reviewed on TA for some reason as “delicious” when it’s nowhere near that good).

However, whilst I wouldn’t quite stretch to a delicious, I would say that the beef stew with rice dish that I had was very nice indeed. The owner also took time to personally explain each dish on offer, which was a nice touch.

After adding a can of Coke Zero, the bill came to just €9 ... which was extremely good value.

Not bad at all !,"Popped in here for dinner as it was one of the first restaurants I came to after leaving the hotel and I couldn’t be bothered to walk far.

My heart sank when I found out that the menu was a booklet of wipe-clean plastic pages with photos of each dish. In my experience this doesn’t normally bode well for the quality of the food you are about to receive !

However, this must be the exception that proves the rule because both my courses (stuffed vine leaves starter & kebab main) were surprisingly tasty. I was also given an “on the house” baclava dessert which was also very nice.

After I’d ordered a Greek coffee (double) to finish the bill came to a reasonable €28.

I’m not sure I’ll actively seek this place out for a return visit, as time is limited and there are so many other places to try, but I certainly didn’t regret choosing it on this occasion.",March 2019,Barbadimos Syntagma,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d12641648-Reviews-Barbadimos_Syntagma-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5

Great atmosphere & fine food,"Popped in for dinner after walking past and hearing the live music coming from inside.

The place was really busy as it was the night before a national holiday, but I got the last free table.

The live music was being played by two musicians on one side of the room and appeared to be traditional Greek songs, although my knowledge of Greek music is limited so I wouldn’t know for sure.

I wondered if I’d stumbled into a huge tourist trap but after a short time it became evident that the clientele was split roughly evenly between tourists there to listen to the music as a novelty, and locals (in couples & small groups of family & friends) who sang along, danced & made requests.

The atmosphere was extremely relaxed with diners joining in with some of the more popular tunes & getting up to show their Greek dancing moves in the open space in front of the musicians. As the evening wore on the balance tilted more towards locals.

I wondered if the food would be terrible, relying on the music to bring customers in, but in fact it was fine. It wouldn’t win any awards but it was perfectly acceptable and the portions were about right.

Overall ... if you fancy an evening listening to some traditional Greek music whilst dining, don’t let the worry that this place may be a tourist trap put you off as it certainly didn’t appear to be so to me, and the atmosphere was very pleasant indeed.",March 2019,Old Tavern of Stamatopoulos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d8408928-Reviews-Old_Tavern_of_Stamatopoulos-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.0
"Great location & friendly, helpful staff","I chose this from the usual pre-trip internet search and I’m pleased to say that it didn’t disappoint.

It was ideally located on one of the two main parallel streets within easy reach of the ruins and all the restaurants.

The reception area is spacious and the sofas provided a really nice place to relax and chat to other guests.

I had one of the more basic rooms, but it was spotlessly clean, comfortable and had all the usual amenities you’d expect from a mid-range hotel.

The one small gripe I had (relatively minor but a little annoying) was that the main nighttime curtain wasn’t wide enough to cover the width of the external window. At first I thought that they’d taken the curtain from one side down for cleaning and forgotten to put it back, until I was informed that all the rooms were like that. Very odd.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, particularly the young lady who staffed reception during the day who was absolutely delightful.

Disappointing !,"Popped along for dinner on a Saturday evening based on the TripAdvisor reviews.

I was aware that it was a low budget basic Greek home-cooked style restaurant, and I wasn’t expecting Michelin starred cuisine. However, the word “delicious” cropped up in so many of the previous reviews that I was expecting something ... well ... delicious !

What I got was certainly not delicious.

I ordered the souvlaki for main course and was given a single skewer of chewy bland meat and about a dozen soggy chips. This was by far the worst meal I’d had in my two days in Delphi.

Was it cheap ? Well yes, I guess it was. 17 Euros for two courses & a carafe of house white wine (they didn’t have any red !). However, I’d had a similar sized meal at Taverna Dion for lunch and paid 19 Euros. That lunch had indeed been delicious.

There wasn’t even an excuse that they were really busy. There was only one other diner in there for the duration of my visit, whilst other nearby places were quite full (which might explain a few things).

My recommendation ... spend 2 Euros more and get a properly delicious Greek cuisine meal at Taverna Dion.

Maybe I just caught it on a bad evening ?",March 2019,Taverna Gargadouas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189408-d1103015-Reviews-Taverna_Gargadouas-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Good food & nice quiet atmosphere,"Popped along for dinner on the recommendation of the hotel receptionist and wasn’t disappointed.

The wild boar stifado was delicious and the meat was so tender it crumbled on the fork. I asked for a carafe of a “local red wine” to go with the dish and what I was given was also very nice indeed (no idea exactly what it was !).

Along with a herb pie starter the whole meal came to less than €30 which was pretty reasonable.

The restaurant was light & had a bit more of a formal feel to it than some of the other places I’ve been to whilst in Greece (ie less obviously “themed”) although the decor was still pleasant.

Overall ... definitely recommended for a decent meal.",March 2019,To Patriko Mas,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189408-d1103017-Reviews-To_Patriko_Mas-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Wonderful historical site,"Visiting the ruins is probably the primary reason why 99% of tourists come out to Delphi in the first place, so describing them as a “must see” when in the area seems rather pointless.

However, I have to say that they lived up to expectations and well worth making the effort to travel the three hours or so from Athens if you can spare a couple of days.

The town is tiny and when I was there (out of season) the quiet relaxed vibe was a welcome contrast to the hustle & bustle of the capital.

The ruins were only a ten minute walk along the main road out of town. I’m not sure how busy it gets at peak season, but I was able to easily avoid the few tour groups that were there (mainly of school children) and wander around the ruins peacefully.

The site is basically on the side of a hill, and there are some steep-ish paths to navigate, but even the older tourists seemed to manage OK by taking things slowly.

As with a lot of the Greek historical sites I’ve visited, you have to use your imagination quite strongly to picture the buildings how they would have looked, and hence a visit to the modern museum a few hundred metres away is a must. The ticket includes entry to both the ruins and the museum anyway, so there’s little reason not to pop in to the museum.

Overall ... if you are in Delphi then you are probably there to see the ruins anyway, but if you are in Athens and have a couple of days to spare it’s definitely worth making the effort to come to Delphi.",March 2019,Delphi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189408-d523823-Reviews-Delphi-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",attractions,4.0,5.0
Great food & fantastic view,"Popped in for lunch after spending the morning wandering around the ruins.

The view out into the valley was amazing and as it was out of season I was able to choose an appropriate table to make the most of that view.

I was pretty impressed with the menu choices, which had a nice home-cooked theme to it, and I could easily have chosen a number of the dishes.

I opted for the beef stew and it was delicious. The meat was incredibly tender & tasty. I also asked for a glass of a locally produced “house” red wine, even though that option didn’t appear to be on the menu, and what I was given was very drinkable indeed.

Overall ... I was very impressed with the food, wine and the general ambience (breathtaking view, nice prompt unfussy service etc) and would thoroughly recommend this place.",March 2019,Taverna Vakhos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189408-d1023626-Reviews-Taverna_Vakhos-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Amazing place ... even with the cranes & scaffolding !,"Although I was well aware that refurbishment work was ongoing at the venue it was still a little disappointing to see the site so dominated by huge cranes & scaffolding.

I guess that you have to appreciate the bigger picture and make better use of your imagination when you are stood in front of this amazing building, but judging by the pace of the work I witnessed whilst I was there I can’t help wondering if this is going to be another Sagrada Familia and the scaffolding will still be in situ in a 100 years time !

Food average but atmosphere good,"Opted for this restaurant for dinner whilst wandering around the area looking at options. To be honest I probably could have chosen other places either further up, or further down, the flight of steps upon which numerous restaurants are all lined.

The food was average, but perfectly acceptable. My meal filled me up but wasn’t particularly tasty.

What impressed me most was the lively atmosphere. The outdoor tables up & down the steps were almost full despite it being mid-March & not exactly warm ! The clientele appeared to be young & mostly locals, and the tables for one restaurant seemed to merge with the neighbouring one.

I’d definitely recommend the area, but the next time I go I’ll try one of the other restaurants.",March 2019,Anafiotika Cafe - Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3582872-Reviews-Anafiotika_Cafe_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Amazing artefacts beautifully presented.,"I’d read good reviews of this modern museum and was not disappointed.

The artefacts from the Acropolis are beautifully presented and there are video areas showing documentaries on the construction.

When I was there, there were many school groups going around which was lovely to see.

Lovely little cafe,"After a few hours wandering around the Acropolis, and the impressive museum, I was looking for somewhere to rest my legs and get a cold drink. After looking at the TripAdvisor reviews I headed to this delightful little cafe/book shop a short walk away.

The place was full of what appeared to be young locals, which was a sign that they were doing something right. It was light and airy inside and the tweeting of the caged budgie added a bit of natural atmosphere. I had a homemade lemonade, which was really nice, and just chilled out for an hour or so.

The owner encouraged customers to offer seats on their tables to new arrivals when the rest of the seating was full, which made for a nice social atmosphere.

Thoroughly recommended if you are in the area.",March 2019,Little Tree Books & Coffee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10868423-Reviews-Little_Tree_Books_Coffee-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Great food & excellent service,"I headed to Epikouros for dinner on my first night in Delphi based on its high TripAdvisor rating & the fact that it was very close to my hotel.

It was almost empty when I arrived at 8pm but swelled to about half full by 9pm despite it being very much out of season.

My main dish, the Goat, was simply delicious. It had clearly been slow-cooked for some considerable time and the meat fell off the bone. I’d asked for a carafe of local Greek red wine to accompany the meal and what I was given was also delicious. I’ve no idea what it was called but the manager said that it was produced by a local family. It was full-bodied and extremely good.

Overall ... very impressed, and that was without the view that many of the other reviews focussed on.",March 2019,Epikouros Taverna - Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189408-d1570804-Reviews-Epikouros_Taverna_Restaurant-Delphi_Phocis_Region_Central_Greece.html,"Delphi, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Great hotel,"Stayed here for a total of 7 nights in two separate spells during my 2 week trip to Turkey.

Both of the rooms I had were spotlessly clean, bright and spacious. The staff, from the receptionist to the bellboy to the restaurant manager, were all unfailingly friendly and helpful.

The buffet breakfasts contained an absolute feast of options and a great way to start the day.

I have nothing but good words to say about this hotel and if I return to Istanbul at some point I'll be looking to stay here.",April 2017,Hotel Amira Istanbul,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293974-d1674691-Reviews-Hotel_Amira_Istanbul-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",hotels,5.0,5.0
Interesting experience,"Popped in on the last day of my trip just to sample a ""must do"" experience. Chose this particular venue because of the #1 TA rating and it's proximity to my hotel.

It certainly isn't cheap, but if you can afford it and you are keen on sampling the experience then I've got to say that it's a nice way to spend an hour or so.

When faced with complete novices such as myself the friendly staff initially explain what will happen and then guide you through each step.

The current (restored) interior decor is impressive and there are areas where they have glass panels allowing bits of the old building to be seen, together with plaques explaining what you are looking at.

I opted for the basic 30-minute ""scrubbing, soaping & washing"" package. It was quite relaxing and I certainly felt clean at the end. The attendant uses a personalised pack of soaps & oils for each customer and you get to keep what they haven't used at the end.

Overall ... thoroughly recommend the experience if you can afford it, and this particular Hamam was clean, visually stunning & friendly.",April 2017,Ayasofya Hurrem Sultan Hamami,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293974-d2203570-Reviews-Ayasofya_Hurrem_Sultan_Hamami-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",attractions,4.0,5.0
Just about worth doing ... but wrap up warm !,"Had this short cruise on my list of ""must do"" activities whilst in Istanbul. I chose this ""official"" company after reading a couple of blog guides recommending them over their ""cowboy"" competitors.

I have to say that I wasn't exactly bowled over by the experience by the end. I'd already spent the best part of a week in Istanbul doing all the main tourist activities and therefore the sight of mosques and notable buildings didn't particularly impress me any more, even though I was seeing them from the water.

Although it was good to see some of the riverfront residential buildings, there wasn't a great deal of visual beauty to be seen (compared to seeing the main tourist sights on land) and the novelty of being on the water quickly wore off. The icy wind drove me down to the lower deck after an hour or so.

Also ... I'd deliberately left my guidebook behind in the assumption that I'd be able to get an audio guide (referred to in some previous reviews). The ticket seller shook his head when I asked about it and offered no further explanation, and there was no sign of any on board !

One other word of warning ... check your change when buying a ticket in cash at the main sales window. I was short-changed ... only slightly ... but there was hardly much change to hand over and it should have been obvious that it wasn't right. Possibly an innocent mistake but possibly not.

Overall ... worth doing, to tick it off the list if nothing else, but possibly consider one of the competitors (who may have audio guides) and wrap up warm !",April 2017,Sehir Hatlari Cruise,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293974-d2227821-Reviews-Sehir_Hatlari_Cruise-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",attractions,3.0,4.0
Great view of the Blue Mosque,"Popped in here with the intention of getting a few good photos of the mosque from the terrace.

I got some excellent pictures and thought it only fair to actually buy something in the 4th floor cafe/restaurant.

I only had a Turkish coffee, and it's probably difficult to produce a bad one, but despite the fact that this place was in the centre of a tourist trap the price of the coffee was the same as I'd paid elsewhere, and just as nice. The place was also full of people having a late lunch and the food looked reasonable.

Overall ... great view of the mosque and I wouldn't necessarily write it off as a tourist trap.",April 2017,The Terrace Restaurant cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d10356735-Reviews-The_Terrace_Restaurant_cafe-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,4.0,5.0
Lovely restaurant,"Popped in for dinner on a Saturday night.

The interior was lovely, warm, cosy and what you'd expect of an upper mid-range restaurant. As it was still early in the year, and quite chilly, the small terrace area was closed, but in the summer I can imagine that it would be a great place to sit as it looks out to sea.

The food was delicious. I had the fish soup for starter and one of the house speciality lamb dishes for mains. Both were full of flavour. I also had a glass of the house red wine which was also of high quality.

The service was friendly but unobtrusive.

Overall ... I've eaten at half a dozen of the TA's top rated Istanbul restaurants over the last couple of weeks and this one is probably my joint favourite. Strongly recommended.",April 2017,Cheers Soul Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d4979203-Reviews-Cheers_Soul_Kitchen-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Good ... but nothing special,"Sought out this place for dinner on a Friday night based on it's TripAdvisor status as the #1 rated restaurant in Istanbul.

I have to say that although my meal was quite good (relative to the price) it was nothing special and I'm totally baffled as to why it's rated so highly.

The service was quick and functional, but I wouldn't describe it as overly friendly, either to myself or anyone else when I was there. In fact I didn't see any of the waiting staff smile or engage in conversation with anyone at any point, and they weren't frantically busy.

I had the soup starter and it was very nice. The mixed kebab main dish was also tasty and quite filling.

Overall ... I'd say that if you are after a relatively cheap meal which is also tasty, and you don't mind the service being fairly basic, then this is a reasonable option. However, I've had much better meals (and service) in other nearby places for only marginally more money and in all honesty I can't say that I strongly recommend it.",March 2017,Bitlisli,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d10170813-Reviews-Bitlisli-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,3.0,5.0
Pretty good,"Stayed here for 3 nights whilst visiting Ephesus.

The (standard double) room (no.10) was a little smaller than I'd expected and the bathroom was possibly the smallest bathroom I've ever experienced. It was also a little shabby in a couple of aspects (wallpaper peeling off the wall slightly ... see photo, and the shower head badly needing to be descaled).

Having said that it was wonderfully adorned with colourful pictures which added real character to the room, and it served the purpose of providing a reasonably-priced base for exploring the ruins.

The breakfast was OK but nothing special.

The staff were very friendly and provided a free shuttle service to the ruins at a time that I wanted to go. The rooftop communal area was also full of character and a nice place to spend some downtime.

Overall ... I think I would recommend this hotel as a reasonably-priced base for Ephesus based on the price, staff friendliness and nice communal area, but beware that the rooms themselves are fairly basic.",March 2017,Hotel Bella,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293976-d562572-Reviews-Hotel_Bella-Selcuk_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Selcuk, Turkey",hotels,4.0,4.5

It contains some excellent artefacts from Ephesus and the area in general and it's really well laid out.

Thoroughly recommend it.",March 2017,Ephesus Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293976-d294514-Reviews-Ephesus_Museum-Selcuk_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Selcuk, Turkey",attractions,4.0,4.5
Amazing !,"If you are anywhere nearby then make sure that you don't miss the opportunity to visit the Ephesus ruins. They are truly exceptional.

I would also recommend getting there early to avoid the tour groups. I arrived at about 9.15am and for about an hour I had the ruins pretty much to myself ! The security guards joked that I was having the VIP experience !

If you are into your photography (as I am) then this quiet time is priceless. By the time I was leaving at around noon it was filling up with the selfie-stick crowd.

One bit of advice ... try to have some picture ID on you, ideally your passport. I was driven to the ruins by my hotel receptionist and we were stopped at a security checkpoint on route. The threat level from terrorism is extremely high at the moment and the police demanded photo ID from me, which I didn't have on me. It took a bit of persuasion from the receptionist to get me through the checkpoint and it'd be a lot easier just to have ID.",March 2017,Ancient City of Ephesus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293976-d548950-Reviews-Ancient_City_of_Ephesus-Selcuk_Izmir_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Selcuk, Turkey",attractions,5.0,5.0
Reasonable,"Popped in for a Chinese cuisine meal as a bit of an alternative to the local Turkish options I'd had for the previous couple of weeks during my trip.

The general feel of the place was that of a backpacker venue and the food was in keeping with that category ... i.e. cheap & cheerful.

Good food and friendly service at a reasonable price,"Deliberately picked this restaurant out for dinner on a Thursday evening as it was ""nearby"" to my hotel and highly ranked on TripAdvisor.

The place isn't much to look at, situated off of a first floor balcony accessed via a stairwell on the corner, and the flashing neon sign certainly didn't add any element of class to my initial impressions, but the quality of the food (relative to the price) and the great service more than made up for the visual deficiencies.

I was the only diner in the main section of the restaurant so the waiter (whom I believe to also be the owner as he referred to the place as ""my restaurant"") was able to concentrate on me.

When I unwittingly chose a meze starter which (unbeknown to me) was perfectly complemented by another one of the meze options that I hadn't chosen he brought me that other dish ""on the house"" so that I could savour the combination ... and he was right !

My main dish of lamb stew was tastier than I'd expected and there was a bread refill when I needed it.

OK,"Popped in for lunch based on the #1 TripAdvisor rating.

It was a lovely warm afternoon and I sat outside in the sunshine. The menu was basic and I opted for what appeared to be one of the house specialities, Turkish pizza.

Basically it did the job of satisfying my hunger but it would be stretching things a little bit to say that there was anything particularly impressive about it. It wasn't especially tasty, and there service wasn't anything out of the ordinary.

Based on my own experience I'm struggling to see how it gets the current #1 rating !

Quite expensive for OK food,"Chose this place for dinner as it looked quite ""classy"" and had a high rating.

The interior is quite nice, definitely upper mid-range, but the prices reflected that and the food (and service) failed to impress particularly.

I wouldn't want to be too critical of this restaurant.

Superb !,"Stayed here for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The room was immaculately clean and looked amazing in its ""cave"" style. I even had my own functioning wood-burning fire which I tried out one evening.

I made the ""mistake"" of leaving the window open one night to cool the room a bit and woke up to find that I'd been joined in the room by one of the friendly local cats which had snoozed the night away in one of the chairs !

OK,"I put this on my list of things to do as it was highly recommended in some of the guides I read.

It's basically a small area of caves that they've enclosed off and you wander around it in a circular manner popping in and out of each one. A couple of the church caves have some beautiful, colourful frescoes painted on the walls & ceiling, but the vast majority of the caves are just small basic holes in the rock.

It's OK, and if you have time to spare it's probably just about worth visiting, but if you are pushed for time in my opinion you wouldn't be missing out on a great deal if you couldn't go given that the whole area around Goreme is riddled with caves which you can wander in and out of for free on a trek.",March 2017,Goreme Open-Air Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297983-d298413-Reviews-Goreme_Open_Air_Museum-Goreme_Cappadocia.html,"Goreme, Turkey",attractions,3.0,4.5
Amazing experience,"First time up in a hot air balloon and what a place to do it ! Amazing views.

Picked up from the Kelebek hotel at 6am and taken to the company base where a small buffet breakfast had been laid out.

After a short while you are dividing into groups based on the size of basket you've opted for and mini-bussed to the launch site where you watch as they inflate the balloon (which is an impressive experience in itself).

You get a brief safety talk around the landing procedures and then you rise silently up into the air (apart from the occasional loud roar of the burner !).

The dual sight of masses of colourful balloons all ascending at the same time, together with the bizarre rock formations below, makes for an unforgettable experience. The hour or so that we were up felt like 10 minutes !

We were incredibly lucky with the weather, a cloudless morning with only a tiny breath of wind. I've no idea how much poorer weather would affect the experience.

To be honest all the companies are probably very much alike, but having opted for Butterfly I can vouch that they were very friendly & knowledgeable ... and they got me back down again in one piece !",March 2017,Butterfly Balloons,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297983-d1839168-Reviews-Butterfly_Balloons-Goreme_Cappadocia.html,"Goreme, Turkey",attractions,5.0,5.0
Deserves the #1 rating,"Popped along for dinner on a Sunday evening without a reservation not expecting a problem given that every other restaurant in the area was virtually empty. However, this place was busy and they only just managed to squeeze me in.

The restaurant had a lovely warm, cosy atmosphere which was probably helped by the fact that it is quite small (although in the warmer summer months I believe that they also use an outdoor area at the front).

The choice is quite limited. They run a 4-course set menu where the only real decision to make is between the 4 or 5 options for the main course. You can also skip courses if you aren't hungry enough for the whole lot.

The food was delicious, and because the menu is set there isn't much waiting time between courses. There isn't much point going into detail on each course as it changes (apparently) on a daily basis.

The main thing that will live in the memory for me from my visit is the quality of the service. The Iranian waitress (Mazi) was superb, working the small room with a lovely easy charm and making each table feel like nothing was too much trouble. I watched as she fussed affectionately over little children and facilitated guests moving to a different table between courses when a more convenient one became free. Service like that is not necessarily a given.

Later in the evening the owner himself came out and chatted to people. I had a good long conversation with him about the history of the restaurant, Turkish politics, and the tourist scene in general.

Overall I had a lovely evening and would thoroughly recommend this restaurant.",March 2017,Pumpkin Goreme Restaurant and Art Gallery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297983-d5445022-Reviews-Pumpkin_Goreme_Restaurant_and_Art_Gallery-Goreme_Cappadocia.html,"Goreme, Turkey",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Nice place,"Popped in for dinner as the restaurant was about 30m from my hotel room.

It was a Saturday evening and it was almost full. The decor was nice and the service pleasant, although both lacked the character I've experienced elsewhere during my trip to Turkey.

The food was good. My kofte starter was lovely and the testi kebab main dish was very tasty indeed. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the house red wine which was very drinkable.

The price (70 TL for starter, main & glass of wine) was commensurate with a lower high end restaurant which is what I think this place aspires to.

Don't see where the rating comes from !,"Popped in for a late lunch. There was only one other table in use. It was a nice, warm sunny day and I was able to sit at one of the outside tables and watch life go by.

Very good restaurant,"Popped in for dinner (without a reservation) at 8pm and it was about half full. The ""cave"" theme (like pretty much everywhere in town) makes for a really cosy atmosphere and the fire helped as well.

The service was incredibly friendly. The menu was a bit different with the main courses simply being described as ""the main dish"" and the only choice being the type of meat.

The waiter (he might have also been the owner judging by the nature of the conversation we had later around the history of the place as a former stable) assured me that if I didn't like what he brought me he wouldn't charge me for it !

Clearly he knows what he's doing making bold statements like that because the slow-cooked lamb stew he served up was delicious.

The menu suggested that you could ""discuss"" the main dish with the waiter so although I opted to simply go with the initial suggestion I got the impression from the wording of the menu that they would probably cook you whatever you asked for, although I'm not certain about that.

Lives up to the rating,"Sought this place out for lunch after a few hours wandering around the Topkapi Palace.

Given the no.1 TripAdvisor rating in the whole of Istanbul I feared that I may not get a table, or that it may be over-hyped. I needn't have worried on either front. The restaurant was empty at 3pm and I was able to choose one of the prime viewing tables for a great vista of the Bosphorus & Galata Tower in the distance.

Given the lack of customers there wasn't any pressure on the waiter, and he was able to find the perfect balance of friendliness, helpfulness & unobtrusiveness.

I opted for the Sultan Kebab which was simply the best meal I've had in Istanbul so far. The meat was full of flavour and went superbly with the tomato & basil sauce and the yoghurt. All for less than 50 Turkish Lira.

I was immensely impressed with the food, service and views and I'm determined to try this place for dinner later in my trip.

Well worth the no.1 rating.",March 2017,Olive Anatolian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d800222-Reviews-Olive_Anatolian_Restaurant-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Well worth a visit,"Sought out this place as an lunchtime alternative to the tourist traps around Istiklal Caddesi. It was a 10 minute stroll away but well worth the effort.

The owner talked me through the options which were written on a blackboard. Apparently the menu (which is based firmly on local home-cooked styles) changes so often that they don't bother producing printed versions.

I opted for the Turkish ravioli topped with yoghurt and was very impressed. The flavour combinations really worked.

I was the only person there so it's difficult to comment on the atmosphere but the interior was really light and pleasant. I managed to have a long chat with the owner about Turkish home-cooked cuisine in general and the impact of low tourist levels on their business.

Overall a very pleasant experience and I'd thoroughly recommend it.",March 2017,No:19 Dining,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d6975432-Reviews-No_19_Dining-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Reasonable,"Sought out this place for dinner based on it's high rating.

The interior was atmospheric and interesting. I was the only diner there so service was rapid and attentive.

I was a little surprised with the very limited menu choice but I guess it's a bistro rather than a full-blown restaurant.

I opted for the Shepherd's casserole and to be honest, although it wasn't anything special, it was OK. When combined with the copious basket of bread, it was sufficiently filling.

Based on my experience this evening I find it difficult to see how the previous reviews could be justified.
