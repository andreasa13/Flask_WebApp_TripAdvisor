By far the best curry in Worcester.,"My husband and I have been getting takeaways from Montis for over a decade now. It is always excellent. The portions are large. Everything tastes fresh. Our favourite order is chicken pathia, sag paneer and peshwari naan. It is hands down the best curry in Worcester, and the best sag paneer I've ever had.",January 2021,Montis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186424-d1318472-Reviews-Montis-Worcester_Worcestershire_England.html,"Worcester, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent food.,Had a takeaway from here tonight. Everything we had was excellent. So fresh and well prepared. We loved the katsu chicken curry and the ramen was absolutely amazing.

Meat!,"Good pub serving burgers and meat platters. Lovely staff. Portions are huge! I couldn't finish it all. We were particularly impressed with the sides - mac n cheese, pit beans and spicy chips.

Very good coffee and cake,Found this little coffee van whilst wandering round the market and felt the need for a little break. Very good mocha and flat white.

Delicious food and friendly service.,"We very much enjoyed our dinner at this lovely friendly restaurant. We received a warm welcome and excellent service throughout our meal. The covid measures are very good - first restaurant we have been to where the wait staff are all wearing masks. Very good.
We enjoyed 3 delicious courses. In particular the beef cheeks were beautifully cooked and so tender. Very nice wines and beer. I throughly recommend a visit.

Enjoyable visit.,"Happened upon this farm park whilst exploring the coast. Really enjoyed feeding various animals and walking around the farm.

Lovely visit.,"Unfortunately we were not able to visit the inside of the castle as there are limited numbers allowed in. However, the gardens made for a lovely walk. The walled gardens are truly beautiful. There is a small shop and art gallery. Plus the restaurant serving a mix of Spanish and English food was worth the 30min wait for food.

Pasties on the beach.,I had had a craving for a pasty all week so we popped in here and took 2 pasties to the beach. The lamb and mint was excellent but the beef and ale was a little disappointing.

Underwhelming doughnuts.,"Having seen pictures of the doughnuts from the blue bell we popped in to try a couple. They are very large but unfortunately rather disappointing when it comes to flavours. The biscoff one was just a bit bland, didn't seem to have much flavour at all. Plus the chocolate flaked off as soon as I bit into it. The husband had the lemon and poppy seed which had an overwhelmingly sweet filling. Too sweet to allow enjoyment of it.",September 2020,The Blue Bell Deli&Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1093682-d10218535-Reviews-The_Blue_Bell_Deli_Bistro-New_Quay_Ceredigion_Wales.html,"New Quay, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.5

"Great staff, average food","Never been before so decided to try it in the eat out scheme. The best thing about the restaurant is the staff. They are all friendly and working very hard on what was a very busy night for them. However the food is basic, a lot of it was bland, all of it searingly hot. My husband burned his lip as it just would not cool down. The portions are big but this doesn't make up for the quality of food and the use of cheap ham and other ingredients.

Bland disappointing food,"Had a takeaway last week. It was a change from our usual Indian takeaway based on the positive reviews. However, we were disappointed.

Super friendly Greek restaurant,"My husband and I were treated very well by the lovely staff here. We very much enjoyed our starters, and the baklava for dessert was huge and excellent. However we were let down by the main course. Although the fish was well cooked there did not seem to be any seasoning on either of our dishes at all. With the addition of boiled veg and potatoes the whole dish was completely underwhelming and very very bland. Perhaps we would have done better with a meat dish. Still it was a pleasant evening as we received such a warm welcome.",January 2020,Elaea Mezedadiko,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d10587843-Reviews-Elaea_Mezedadiko-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Excellent food and service.,"We dined here twice during our stay as we were so impressed with the first meal.

Great to visit an Olympic stadium.,"The first stadium of the modern Olympic games. We spent quite a bit of time here, walking around, visiting the little museum, getting lots of photos at various points in the stadium. The scale of the place cannot be appreciated on the outside.

Daytime pitstop,"We needed a place to relax with a coffee after the busy streets of monastriaki and this place fit the bill. It is a very relaxed and beautifully decorated place.

Excellent greek food.,"My husband and I had the Greek sharing platter. Everything on it was absolutely delicious. The homemade tzatsiki and pitta were delicious, the lamb with lemon potatoes were tender. The baked feta with tomatoes and peppers were so soft. Plus the moussaka was beautiful. The portions are enormous also - we could have fed a whole family! We were too stuffed to order pudding but the staff were so lovely they gave us a piece of walnut cake and shot of mastica anyway.

Cozy cocktail bar,Dropped by for a couple of cocktails on a quiet night. Service was good and the bar was relaxed and comfortable. Cocktails were well made and the service was good.

Every one of them was fabulous. We ended up staying for a couple of hours even though we only intended to drop in for one drink.

Underwhelming.,"We went based on the consistently good reviews but were disappointed. It's a nice place, plenty of space and the staff were friendly.

Lots to see and good views.,This is a great site with a fair bit to see. There is a well preserved temple that you can get really close to and some good pieces in the museum.

Worth a wander in the winter.,"It is easy to view the whole of this site from outside the fence or from the bar of the nearby hotel. Since it is half price in winter at €4 we decided to have a closer look, which was nice. Quiet too. However one whole side was blocked off so we couldn't walk all the way round.

Well thought out museum.,I'm not a big museum visitor but this one is worth the time to see close up the pieces that have been moved from the parthenon and other buildings. It is not large. We saw it over an hour. Very peaceful when we came about 3pm. They will scan your bag on the way in and the area where they do this is very cramped. Also it is really hot in the whole of the museum for some reason. All in all a well designed museum for slow meandering.

A must see.,We went yesterday at 11am. Absolutely no queue at the east entrance. Half price at €10 as it is winter. Easy walking around as it was a lovely temperature and there were no crowds. Saw all of the sights on the hill at a leisurely pace. The whole experience was really relaxed and the whole site is beautiful with incredible views across Athens to the sea. I don't know why people go in the summer. I think our experience would not have been as good later in the year. Wear shoes with good grip to feel secure and enjoy.

Lovely cosy hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights. We received a warm welcome from all of the staff that we met. First impressions were very good - the lovely little bar, the fire, comfy sofas. Our apartment was huge and lovely and warm when we arrived. The full kitchen was brilliant and allowed us to cook a nice meal for our first night. The bed is super comfy and the bathroom large, even if the water pressure is a little low. The whole place is spotlessly clean. The only down side is the room was not that quiet. We could hear people talking in the bar, children running around and our upstairs neighbours stomping around well after midnight keeping us awake.

Beautiful,"Having come on a day trip from sofia it was wonderful to see such a beautiful old town. The buildings are incredible. There is lots to see. Good view from the hill over the new town. Plenty of art and craft shops to browse in, and a little distillery. Plus it's warmer than sofia which was great as the weather is turning cold.",September 2019,Plovdiv Old Town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295391-d546452-Reviews-Plovdiv_Old_Town-Plovdiv_Plovdiv_Province.html,"Plovdiv, Bulgaria",attractions,5.0,4.5
Delicious salad,Comfortable lunch stop with delicious salads. Prices were good and the service was quick.

Not much to see,"It is pretty cool that these ruins are in a hotel, but there is really not much to see.

Remarkably well preserved,"Considering how old this church is, it is very well preserved. It's small but pretty with frescoes dating from the Romans.

Beautiful,Small but impressive cathedral. Beautiful wall decorations. The lighting is stunning and the whole place feels relaxed. I definitely recommend buying a photo pass for 10lev as I took loads and they definitely check that you have a pass.,September 2019,St. Alexander Nevski Cathedral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294452-d547282-Reviews-St_Alexander_Nevski_Cathedral-Sofia_Sofia_Region.html,"Sofia, Bulgaria",attractions,5.0,4.5
