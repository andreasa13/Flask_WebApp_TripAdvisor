Great view but not for light sleeper,"We checked in on Friday evening smoothly, view of our room was a beautiful golf course across the street. Unfortunately, the traffic noise was very bad all night long that i couldnt sleep until 2.30am when I finally put on my headset. They kindly changed my room to face GBK on the next day, however the key exchange around 2pm was taken too long with a long queue.

Entire island with ruins to explore!,"Who would not want to do that??
Although the weather was extremely windy, and I get seasick easily, u braved myaelf to take the boat and landed in Deloa about 30 min from Mykonos town. We didnt buy the guided tour of €50, we bought the boat tix €20 and entrance fee to the archaeological site €12. I am glad we didnt buy the guided tour because we like exploring oursleves in our own pace which is a lot fastwr than the tour.

Dream come true,"Having learnt about it in Architecture History 20yrs ago, I was trully in an awe entering the Acropolis! Beautifully restored. Weather was good, sunny but not too hot, with some cool breeze. We started at 9am so the crowd was still bearable, should have started at 8am.

Need a woman's touch,"Location is not bad once you find it, because it is in a back alley of the mainroad. It's 300m from bus stop to north as well as to the south. Plenty of foods, mini market and bakeries.
Room is a good size however the furniture is really like thrown in there, electrical cables dangling. The worst is the condition of the bathroom: shower stall is TINY! Literally about 50x50cm. I hate it when the shower curtain sticks to my body while showering so I let it opened. Ofcourse water splashed out and made entire bathroom floor wet. Towels were also very coarse/ hard. The soap bottle was broken and after telling them, they didnt change it.

Ammon tour,"Weather was quite good in mid Oct, was in late teens low twenties. Tour group was 24 people, good size and all disciplined. One way busride was 3hrs, visited 2 monasteries, wished we had 1 more with a more challenging hikes and lose the store visit to see how they create byzantine arts. Helen, tour attendant was nice and attentive. She even gave 3 door prizes and small tokens for all of us. Would recommend her and Ammon Tour.

Uncoordinated and not hospitable enough,"Our group of 17 people arrived at the hotel around 8.30pm. Check in process by the staff, Anna, was not smooth, 6 rooms were not coordinated with our requests of different room types. Messy and uncoordinated. Anna said 'Rooms are ready and the keys are all at the doors. Rooms and bungalows are that way' as she pointed at clusters of rooms and bungalows that were spread out. No room numbers and she didnt remember the room name vs type of rooms. How are we supposed to know which one our room is?

We ordered and shared that plus a bowl of salad and cold beverages. The resto was 60% full mostly with business people, foods tasted average but good presentation, drinks also the same while ambiance is nice.

maintenance needs to be kept up,"I was here last April 2017, it was a great experience. Hotel was cleaned, restaurant was cleaned and foods were good. But this time it was not so. The restaurant's floor and window sill near our table was quite dirty from left over foods/ crumbs and a lanseh fruit (duku) was still on the floor near the corner where it was not served during breakfast when I was eating. The BBQ foods were tough and didn't taste so good.
The espresso coffee machine in the room was leaking. The drain stopper in the bathtub could not operate well. The hot water didn't get warm fast enough that it made me guilty for wasting water while waiting for hot water. The comforter was too heavy.
The locker room was too small that 2 shower rooms were full or maybe it was a wrong weekend with large crowd when I was there

Swimming pool is a good size except that half of the depth is only 80cm which is very shallow for adults. Breakfast was not so good, could be improved.

Facade only,"Don't expect to see the entire church, this is only the facade. A bit disappointing.

If you didn't want to own a Ferrari before your visit .....,"you will want to own one when you leave :) The cars are amazing, especially after learning about Enzo and the engine etc.
Moderately sized museum, not so interactive, but beautifully displayed Ferrari cars ..... entrance fee is a bit pricey for the size.
Museum shop sells stuffs as expensive as the car :)",April 2016,Museo Casa Enzo Ferrari,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187803-d2693933-Reviews-Museo_Casa_Enzo_Ferrari-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html,"Modena, Italy",attractions,4.0,4.5
