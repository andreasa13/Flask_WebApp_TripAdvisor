Best of the area,"Waiters are kind and eager to help, fast.

Meals are delicious, portions are big and prices are above average, not so expensive.

Every day between 12:00-14:00 they offer discount menus including soup (really tasty) + pizza/pasta + drink for a great price.

Definitely a place to go for a pizza.

Note: It has a warm and cosy garden at the back, prefer to have a seat there if you can.",February 2020,Emporio Ristorante Levent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d17528941-Reviews-Emporio_Ristorante_Levent-Istanbul.html,"Istanbul, Turkey",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Better than Acropolis about preservation,"The place is really well preserved, it's almost complete on the outside like it was 2k years ago. The inside is missing a lot and the imagination will have to do more for it. But it also has a really nice view of Acropolis which is outstanding to capture two beauties in one picture frame.",February 2020,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful,"As expected,it was really beautiful. It's a shame they don't let you go inside. The museum was closed when we were touring but you should check the museum too, which is near the Acropolis.",February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Best of the area,"Live greek music by talented musicians, delicious traditional food (possibly one of the best in Plaka area), woods burning in fire place warming your heart, helpful and smiling service staff and not so expensive prices made this place best restaurant in Athens for us.

They allow reservations.

For food; I strongly suggest the tzatiki(yogurt, cucumber and garlic) which was amazing, stuffed grape leaves (dolma) was also really nice, pastacio and mousakka was a delight.

Definitely a place to remember and come again.

If you make a reservation, go for the tables near fire place(chimney) (:",February 2020,Anafiotika Cafe - Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d3582872-Reviews-Anafiotika_Cafe_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Beautiful view,"The view is beautiful, meals are nice. I didn't like the pastacio (lasagna like Greek food) but liked the mousakka and loved the dolma, ate two plates.

Friendly cafe with good food,"Friendly service and above average food quality. Pancakes can be improved, they were a bit thick and stiff but with lots of wallnut and honey and big in portions.

"Small, cosy and delicious","Friendly owners, a classic family restaurant with great food, big portions and really affordable prices.

Pure Irish pub,"Great place to have a beer and a wonderful, friendly waiters. The only feedback I can give is for the tables with air condition above them, they can be a little bit cold.

Tasty meals and warm hospitality,"We had a meal as two couples on the valentines day and from the entrance to the payment it was delightful. We had a tiny problem with the payment but I'm sure it was a common translation complication. The restaurant owner is really friendly and we are hoping to go there again.

By the way, restaurant has special care for vegetarians and vegans. Menu items are marked for vegans and vegetarians separately. Vegan mousakka was really nice.",February 2020,Gods' Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d1724517-Reviews-Gods_Restaurant-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5

Overall Disappointing,"The restaurant's decoration quickly amazed us when we entered the place. But that was about it, food was average and overpriced for Belgrade.

When we (5 friends) tried to pay the bill with credit cards separately, elderly waiter pulled a face at us, so much that we had to insist on it hard for him to accept it.

I don't expect someone to come here again once they know what it's like.",November 2019,Lorenzo & Kakalamba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294472-d2287452-Reviews-Lorenzo_Kakalamba-Belgrade.html,"Belgrade, Serbia",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Professional and cozy,"Food was both lovely (Smoky, Garden(Vegan) and Extra Classic sandwiches, omlette) and with large portions, more than enough for a single person usually and prices are average, not expensive at all.

The only negative we had was during payment. They made us rush and we had to hurry after they told us they needed the table.

That's never a nice thing IMHO, specially you are obviously a tourist. Money calculations can be hard for a 5 person group.

The place is cozy but small, I guess that was the reason we treated that way, I hope they won't make it to anyone else again.

Overall lovely place, would suggest to anyone.
Fresh fruit juices are delicious.",November 2019,Red Bread,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294472-d6691516-Reviews-Red_Bread-Belgrade.html,"Belgrade, Serbia",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Beautiful Resources and Mediocre Management,"We stayed 4 nights from April 28, '18 to 2 May, '18.

TL;DR: Hotel has really beautiful natural resources and hard working staff with nice attitude but management is mediocre, reactive not proactive (which I would not expect from a 5star hotel) and not trustworthy. Customer satisfaction was only tried to address while we were checking out.

Food: 4/5, Resources: 4/5, Management: 2/5, Service: 3/5, Cleanliness: 4/5, Noise: 1/5

Details are below:

Management tried to place us to a standard room while we had booked a double deluxe room despite we double checked it with the manager verbally at the checkin process. After we made it certain that we know the room differences and that wasn't the room we booked, bellboy had a call with management and quickly directed us to a deluxe room. (This just made us feel tried for tricks and wasn't pleasant)

During our stay, we had a constant noise problem. (Care for 23XX room numbers, and possibly 22XX and 24XX too) Our room was near the basketball and tennis courts which was full of noise almost till the night hours from the early hours of the day.

Biggest problem we had was in our 3rd day there, some worker used chainsaw 10 meters next to our room (which is staff room for that kind of stuff I think, and it is totally unacceptable) for couple of hours. I told the problem to management and they suggested to change our room location which we rejected since it was a day off from our leave and requested from them to stop that construction work while nearby rooms are full, they told they'll do that immediately and despite that worker continued an hour more while we left the room seeking silence.

Beach has a nice sand but not without stones, comfy, has two large piers (one was under construction while we stayed) and sea was clean and clear during half of our visit.

Beach has 2 nearby refrigerators holding water and Ayran (local Turkish drink) and that is your only serving option in the beach. They told me that a bar will be present in the pier in season. But this is a great inconvenience for people who prefer sea over pools. This hotel is more suited to you if you are a pool person. It has multiple really cool pools where population is separated nicely and not crowded. I can't say resources are equal for pool and the beach.

Meals was nice and satisfying for me but my girlfriend is a vegan and had trouble finding suitable food (specially ""hot"" vegan food) for her although a vegetarian would not have a problem I assume.

Minibar was below average, 2 20cl bottles of beer, 3 sodas, 1 mineral water, 2 water and a biscuit, refreshing daily. We had shortage of water multiple times a day and brought us water from pool bar. No room service available AFAIK. When you try to pick up sodas from the minibar to take to your room, it is not allowed (all inclusive dilemma right here)

Hotel was understaffed during our stay, don't know if it is something related to our timing (beginning of season) but the staff seriously performed best and were positive on attitude despite the lack of numbers.",May 2018,Sherwood Exclusive Kemer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g660503-d5991441-Reviews-Sherwood_Exclusive_Kemer-Goynuk_Kemer_Turkish_Mediterranean_Coast.html,"Goynuk, Turkey",hotels,3.0,4.5
