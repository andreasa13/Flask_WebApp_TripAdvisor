Awesome Burgers!,"We made the drive out to Coral Bay twice, once specifically to visit Skinny Legs and the other, because we were in the area and it happened to be lunchtime, to eat at Skinny Lags again! It's a open air restaurant and small chickens run around (don't feed the chicken is the rule), so be prepared for that. But it's a great place to take a break from sun and surf, and have a few drinks and eat really good burgers.

Good BBQ!,"Spent time on the island with family - all of us are from Texas, so we know BBQ! Uncle Joe's was as good as some from home. My brother-in-law and I stopped around 11:30 to place an order and were told the grill hadn't been fired up yet so beware, island time applies! We were still able to order and walked around the city to wait. (Stopped in The Tap Room at Mongoose Junction to cool our heels for a while.) We eventually staggered back to Uncle Joe's around 1:00 and had just a 20 minute or so wait while our order finished cooking. We took the food back to the villa and couldn't resist sampling while driving. Had a selection of chicken and brisket, and sides.

"Great beer, good food","Okay, so I'm not allowed to shop with my wife. Learned this lesson long ago; we're both good with the arrangement. Anyway, while she shops I find a place to hang my hat and drink a beer or three. While in St. John, The Tap Room was the place for me! They have a very nice selection of craft brews - something for every taste. During our stay on the island I tried almost all of them, and liked every single one! In addition to the beer, The Tap Room has a nice food menu. I highly recommend any of the pizzas.

Alexandra was rated at 4.5 stars and the food was every bit of that and more. My mother had a salad that was filled with fresh vegetables and covered with a tasty dressing. I had the linguini with spinach, tomatoes and olives. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the sauce was just right - not so much tomato that it drowned out everything else.

There was only one waitress and she was busy, which means it took her a little bit to get to us. Not her fault by any means, but that's the only reason I didn't give this restaurant a solid 5 stars. (She was as sweet as she could be.)

A Place to Sleep,"Went to Jacksonville on business and had a reservation here. First time to visit so I didn't know quite what to expect. Check-in was quick and easy. The room, although it appeared to have been recently renovated, was nothing special. I've stayed in other Hampton Inns and I'd rate this one slightly below average just on the room alone. It was relatively small and would have been cramped with another person in the rooms. Had booked a king-bed room but none were available at check-in so I had a 2-queen room. (The bed was comfortable.) Very few amenities. If you're a coffee drinker that's about it. Oh, the wi-fi? Agonizingly slow. Otherwise that's about it. The free breakfast was okay. Again, nothing special. So if you're looking for a place to sleep and not much else...this is the place for you.

The ""shtick"" is the same here as any other of the Benihana type places. The selection is pretty much the same as well - beef, chicken or seafood. The pre-dinner Miso soup was bland and the salad ordinary.

"Great Food, Great Beer, Great Service","My mother and I were in town visiting relatives during Irish Fest weekend, and we had some time on our hands so decided to wander into downtown Milwaukee for lunch. Not quite sure how we picked Buck Bradley's but we certainly weren't disappointed. Like some of the other restaurants in the area and on the same street as this establishment, we had our choice of outside or inside seating. Even though the weather was wonderful we were attracted to the interior decor. The bar is FANTASTIC! And the decor is...definitely not boring! Think about pre-pre-prohibition days. It was a little past the lunchtime on Friday afternoon when we arrived and not many people so that may have accounted for the slight wait before a hostess arrived to seat us. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive to our needs.

A very nice lady found in their computer system the last order my wife had made, and she quickly duplicated it. She gave me an estimated price and estimated date of delivery.

Enjoyed Our Stay!,"I took my mother to Milwaukee to visit relatives. Our arriving flight was delayed and we we got to the hotel around midnight. The sliding doors are shut down at some point during the night which, although the area seemed to be nice and quiet, is somewhat understandable. Picking up the phone quickly got the desk clerk's attention and we were quickly let in. The clerk very quickly checked us in, and after a long day of traveling was greatly appreciated. We stayed 4 nights and everyone on staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay very much. Oh, before I forget, the hotel is literally around the corner from Mitchell Field Airport but my mother and I both marveled at how quiet the rooms were. While we were in our rooms we never noticed a single takeoff or landing.

The bartender offered to make us drinks before the tour and told us to make ourselves at home. Since it was such a beautiful day we waited outside in a very nice patio area. The tour lasted about an hour. It was very informative! I learned things I never knew about distilling and the spirits produced, and the tasting at the end of the tour was good - and fun!

She was smart, funny and knowledgable about the menu, so when we found the other place wasn't open we went straight back to the Cadillac. When we got there Kayla saw us at the hostess station, gave us a fun look and waved us back to a table. We had decided previously that we were going to ask for one of her tables...she just made it easy. As I said, she was quick-wit smart and funny, and her recommendations for food selections were spot on. Kayla made our visit to the Cadillac Bar an enjoyable experience.

Typical Sports Bar - Nothin' Special,"Bubbba's just opened here a couple of months ago and I've been looking forward to going since they advertised foods that I like - burgers, pizza, and cold draft beer. I haven't had a chance to go until this afternoon, a Friday. I went for lunch and it was fairly busy but since it was just me I was quickly seated at a booth near the bar. My waitress was friendly and knowledgable about the menu. Again, since it was just me I it was obvious I wasn't going to order very much (so to the waitstaff that means ""small tip"") but my waitress was very attentive, and I appreciated the attention.

My sister and brother-in-law had been previously and enjoyed the Bubbba's Meaty Meat (sp?) pizza, but that was going to be too much for me. So I ordered the chicken nachos. My brother-in-law knows I like good, cold beer and he said I'd like their selection, so I was disappointed when the beer menu had just a few draft beers that weren't the run of the mill domestic brews. They do have the Dallas Blonde on tap so that's what I had.

The food was nothing special - typical of virtually every other sports themed bar I've ever been in - meaning not great.

Women, if you're looking for a nice meal and conversation with your husband, don't go. 50+ big screen TV's will have him looking around or over your head the entire time.

Never Again,"I, my brother-in-law and his brother made a week-long trip to Baltimore to ride the train to Washington DC for a sightseeing vacation. My brother-in-law made the hotel reservations. I should've known better - he's a cheapskate, and it showed in his choice of hotels. I thought with the name Wyndham attached to it that it might have some redeeming qualities, but I found that you (don't) get what you (don't) pay for. The rooms were of poor quality and varied in accommodations. My room didn't have a refrigerator, my brother-in-laws, right next door, did. His had a flat screen TV, mine didn't. Daily cleaning - making the bed, towel, soap, and shampoo replacement was hit or miss (mostly miss). There were two beds in my room. I almost slept in the second bed after a long day in DC and being too tired to shower before bed. After pulling down the sheets...no way. If the sheets had been washed the washer did a horrible job. I won't spell out how I know. Needless to say it was disgusting. If you like to cook your own waffles, breakfast was okay. I preferred the deli across the parking lot - it was cleaner.

About the only redeeming quality this place had was the shuttle service to the airport and train station. But after the first couple of days a handprinted sign showed up in the shuttle asking for tips. We tipped coming from and going back to the airport because the driver handled our bags, but for just the 5 minute drive to and from the train station...I'm not going to tip for that. (Judge if you will.)

I haven't even gotten to when we came back from one trip to DC. It was evening by the time we got back and I was ready for a warm, relaxing shower only to find that my room was locked from the inside. The key card turned the light green and the door would open about a quarter of an inch, but the latch had been thrown across the door. The front desk called the maintenance man, who told me the deadbolt had also been thrown. The mystery was answered once we gained entry. Nothing of mine had been taken, but a bath towel, hand towel, soap and shampoo (both left from when I used them that morning) were gone. The window was open and the screen on the ground outside. I told the front desk all this and the clerk didn't seem to be all that surprised. She said she'd review the ""security camera tapes"" saying they had a camera at the back of the building. She never got back to me, and when I asked the day clerk about it he obviously didn't know what I was talking about.

I learned my lessons. Never stay at a Microtel Inn & Suites, and never trust my brother-in-law to make the hotel reservations.",November 2015,Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham BWI Airport Baltimore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g41232-d89381-Reviews-Microtel_Inn_Suites_by_Wyndham_BWI_Airport_Baltimore-Linthicum_Heights_Maryland.html,"Linthicum Heights, Maryland",hotels,2.0,3.0
"Great food, even better service!","I, my brother-in-law and his brother made a week-long sightseeing trip to DC. After a long morning of walking we spied and stopped in for a bite to eat at Old Ebbitt Grill. We may have been slightly underdressed as tourists, but none of the staff made us feel anything except welcomed. The menu was varied and everything sounded great. Our waitress made some suggestions, one regarding oysters on the half-shell, which I took her up on. The oyster list contained several varieties and our waitress described each type in detail and told us which ones she preferred. (I like raw oysters but I'm no connoisseur.) A half dozen - 2 each of three types, were wonderful - each with their own distinct flavor. (About $16-18 for the 1/2 dozen.) Our main entrees were just as good. The local beer on tap was good and cold, and our waitress stopped by often to see that we were doing okay.

"Poor first impression, but understandable","Our party of 7 adults went to Copeland's shortly after it had been open a few weeks (Sept. 19). We didn't have to wait long, which was nice and somewhat unexpected. Even though we were there at 5pm we were told it might be an hour and 15 minute wait. Ended up being closer to 30 minutes. Any longer and we would have left to go somewhere else. Shortly after we were seated our waitress apologized about all of the fryers being down and we'd have to ordered something from the not-fried menu selections, which narrows the choices down quite a bit. (We should have been told about this prior to being seated.) The other thing it did, we found out, was cause the kitchen to be backed up. We waited well over an hour for our food to be brought out. Some in our group complained about their food not being very warm. Mine was fine - both in temperature and taste. (I had the BBQ shrimp boil. Good spicy taste. I recommend it.) Also, some of the orders were brought out incorrectly or with items missing. These issues were quickly resolved.

Our waitress was attentive and came by several times to check on us and apologize for the wait. I was a bit surprised the manager didn't do the same.

"Good beer selection, bad bar food","This place opened up mid-September 2105, and I had high hopes that it would be my new go-to place for lunch when I'm out running errands on Saturday afternoon. I've been to this place three times now for lunch on Saturday. Here's how it went.

First time I walked in and nobody greeted me at the door (although it was almost noon, I thought at first that I'd walked in before they were officially open) and ended up seating myself at the bar. The bartender introduced himself and wanted to shake my hand. Um, yeah, I'm about to order and eat your food; I don't know where your hands have been so, no, I'm not shaking your hand...mine are clean, thank you. Beer selection looked good and I was wanting to try something new, but the bartender didn't know anything about the beers on tap - just the names. I ordered something that had an oil derrick for a tap handle. Sadly, it was boring. The menu was very limited. Even though the place had been open for a couple of weeks the menu was one piece of paper and, yes, it was very limited. I ordered a cheeseburger, medium, with pepper jack. No pepper jack. Chipotle cheese? Okay, if that's the only spicy cheese you have. After a loooong wait, during which the bartender apologized several times for the wait, my burger finally arrived (25 minute wait, and the place was NOT crowded). You guessed it, it was well-done and cooling quickly. And those fries? Like eating a potato quartered and fried - not much flavor. Not a great first impression but it's new so I gave it another try.

Second time, different bartender. Again with the hand shaking? Stop it already. This guy also didn't know his beers. A month in and the bartenders still don't know what they're serving. I don't get it. Anyway, I ordered a nice, dark beer and nachos. Bartender also didn't know what came on/with the nachos, so he called some guy over who seemed to know what he was talking about. Key was here is ""seemed"". He was wrong. Nachos arrived. They were out of pico. Huh?! How do you run out of pico and still have to get through the Saturday lunch time? You could at least have told me before bringing it out; I might've wanted to order something else. Nachos? Boring. Strike two.

Third time's the charm, right? The place has now been open for more than a month. Bartender (same as the first time) still wants to shake my hand. Dude, stop! He still doesn't know his beers. I ask for a taste of a couple - no problem. Beer tender obliges. For food I ordered what turned out to be a french dip. The meat (and I use that term loosely) was obviously some form of very processed roast beef (maybe). It was bland, but the bread was even worse. It was so dry and boring that it was looking thirstily at the au jus, which was the best part of the meal, or it was looking to drown itself in shame. Yeah, strike three.

(The hostesses were smiling and very friendly!) We waited only a short time before our waitress came to take our drink order. We both tried a local brew, and it was cold and good. We were both in the mood for fried shrimp and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time. (By this time we'd been seated about 15-20 minutes and the place was about full.) The 12 shrimp we each were served were large, butterflied, and excellent. The small bowl of jambalaya was a fitting accompaniment to the shrimp and fries. An excellent meal overall. The only detraction from the meal was the feeling of tables being crammed together with just enough space between to accommodate medium sized people, and we were jostled just a bit whenever people moved past our table - only a slight inconvenience for us.

None of them asked about it. She should have said something, but so should they. Otherwise, Rex's is a typical hotel bar/restaurant. When it's full it's noisy and the food is just average.",July 2013,Rex's American Grill & Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33657-d969625-Reviews-Rex_s_American_Grill_Bar-Steamboat_Springs_Colorado.html,"Steamboat Springs, Colorado",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Great View - Food Not So Much,"Our group of 5 adults (4 - 50+, 1 - 75+) hiked a Mount Werner trail and decided to eat at the grill before taking the gondola back down. The food was cooked on a grill and after hiking up a good hunger we expected the food to taste pretty good, but it was just average. The views more than made up for it, though. Beautiful views of the valley below cannot be topped.",July 2013,Gondola Pub and Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33657-d1123311-Reviews-Gondola_Pub_and_Grill-Steamboat_Springs_Colorado.html,"Steamboat Springs, Colorado",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Hole In The Wall Good,"The Lil Thai House is a bit of a hole in the wall - small - place that serves a variety of really good Thai food. It's not open on weekends, so I don't eat there very often. If it was...I would.",September 2012,Lil Thai House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56193-d1991523-Reviews-Lil_Thai_House-Longview_Texas.html,"Longview, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Average at Best,"I've often heard locals rave about Jucy's buyers, and I've eaten them fairly often, But I've never been impressed. The burgers aren't all that juicy, and I make better tasting ones on the grill at home. The fries are greasy beyond belief - a potato heart attack waiting to happen. I won't make the decision to eat here.",April 2013,Jucy's Hamburgers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56193-d508752-Reviews-Jucy_s_Hamburgers-Longview_Texas.html,"Longview, Texas",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Skip the Meal,"When you walk in the door you're greeted by a display case full of desserts that are obviously made in-house. They look and taste delicious! If you're thinking that the entree part of the meal is going to be just as good...think again. You order from an overhead board...just like any other fast food restaurant. The food is not pre-cooked but it might as well be. It's generally dry and tasteless, and the vast condiments selection doesn't help enough. If you eat in, the tables are close together and the noise can make normal conversation difficult. Oh, and the fries are greasy but tasteless. With the trash bins placed as they are, you're encouraged to bus your own table, and most people do. The only redeeming aspect of this place is the dessert. Get one on the way out to get rid of the taste of the meal, or skip the meal and go straight to dessert. It's the only way I give this place an ""average"" rating.",July 2013,The Butcher Shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56193-d627330-Reviews-The_Butcher_Shop-Longview_Texas.html,"Longview, Texas",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Best Pizza in Longview,"If you're in the mood for pizza in Longview this is the place to get it. Eat in or take out, it's hands down the best pizza joint in the city. It's been around forever. The selection is great. And the beer is cold (for those eating in).",August 2012,Pizza King,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56193-d471288-Reviews-Pizza_King-Longview_Texas.html,"Longview, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Best Mexican in Longview,"The food is the best Tex-Mex in Longview. It's not in any of the general restaurant ""districts"", so it's usually fairly easy to get a seat - 15-20 minute wait as most. The beer selection is typical, but if you haven't tried the Negra Modelo...do. It's a light-tasting Mexican dark ale. The noise level makes conversation difficult, so it's not a great place if you're in a larger group. Even face-to-face or side-by-side conversation can be hard at times. But if you're in the mood for Mexican in Longview, try this place.",August 2012,Posados Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56193-d4028862-Reviews-Posados_Cafe-Longview_Texas.html,"Longview, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great Asian Food,"I've eaten at GZ's several times over the years and it's always been very good. I don't care for sushi, but those I'm with who do really enjoy it. I'm partial to the Mongolian Beef, but all the other dishes I've tried have also been good. The items are just a tad pricy, but if you're in the mood for good asian in Longview...this is the place to go.",February 2013,GZ's Goung Zhou Asian Bistro & Sushi Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56193-d1497183-Reviews-GZ_s_Goung_Zhou_Asian_Bistro_Sushi_Bar-Longview_Texas.html,"Longview, Texas",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Good Tex-Mex,"I had Mi Casita catered in for a business luncheon - a variety of tacos - beef, chicken, and pork. They were all good, and the sauces topped them off perfectly.

"Nice Hike, Great Views","Not a terribly long or arduous hike, and the views were pretty. (Ages/fitness levels in our group ranged from relatively un-fit mid-50s to fit mid-70's.) The falls are pretty. I would not recommend getting off the path for most people except the young (late teens+) and fairly nimble - the rocks at the bottom of the falls and in/along the creek are slippery.",July 2013,Fish Creek Falls,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g33657-d538038-Reviews-Fish_Creek_Falls-Steamboat_Springs_Colorado.html,"Steamboat Springs, Colorado",attractions,4.0,4.5
