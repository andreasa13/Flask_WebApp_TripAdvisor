"Very Nice Rooms, Poorly Run","I have stayed a few times and the rooms are awesome. They are clean and comfortable with everything you need. Mostly. I checked in, after a day of traveling and entered a room that had not yet been cleaned. Unmade bed, trash, towels, obviously not cleaned since the last guest. I was given a different, clean room. Unfortunately, the coffee cartridges provided were not for the coffee maker in the room, but I improvised. I had received a phone call a few days before letting me know the pool was not operational, so I left my suit. The pool was working fine when I checked in. :(
The next day, after working all day, I came to the room and the key didn't work. Housekeeping had been there but didn't finish ?!?

We were disappointed in the food and would recommend getting out of the resort for dinner and exploring some much better cuisine. we visited from Alaska so we were really looking to warm up and spend time in the water, but that wasn't happening. We knew the ocean would be too cold to dive, snorkel or swim in, but we counted on the pools. The pools were freezing cold and way too uncomfortable for swimming.

Expert Service and good food,"I stopped in for a lite dinner and of course, beer. The place was packed with people and I found the only seat left. Entire parties of people chose to eat standing up.

Great Value and Location,"I wouldn't have thought of Bally's but I am so glad I did. The rooms were better than Caesars and for MUCH less.

Top of the World has Slipped to Average,I have been to this restaurant to celebrate a few very special occasions over the last 15 years. All visits were excellent until last week. The service was slow to average and the food was not as good as I remembered. The novelty is really what they are selling. I should have chosen better for my 50th birthday dinner as it was a bit of a let down instead of the treat that was intended to spoil me. They don;t help you celebrate in any sort of way at all.,March 2016,Top of the World,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d481403-Reviews-Top_of_the_World-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Excellent food and value depending on your order,"This is a great place to get a great meal without paying ridiculous hotel/casino/resort prices.

Nice comfy hangout with great food.,This became a home base of sorts while staying at Caesars Palace. The $11 beers and $18 cocktails were a bit much but the food was priced reasonable and everything we had was perfect. Try the blue cheese wedge salad...it's huge and a much better deal than your beer. Also try the corned beef sandwich if you like corned beef and cabbage.,March 2016,Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d3807450-Reviews-Gordon_Ramsay_Pub_Grill-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html,"Las Vegas, Nevada",restaurants,4.0,3.5

Was Expecting More,"I love aquariums and was very excited by all the build up of this shark exhibit. It was great to see, but was not all that is described.

Great food if you order wisely,I would love to come back and try again. I did not order well having gone with the fish and not the pasta. It was way over salted as were the roasted potatoes. Everything on my entrÃ©e was overwhelmed by salt. The caesar salad with anchovies was excellent! My spouse had the ravioli which was excellent and I had a bite of gnocchi that I liked but not as well. Get the signature pasta dish and I am sure you will be pleased.

A great meal with excellent service and good prices. Wow!,We were catching a show at the Fillmore and looking for a nearby place to have dinner. We decided to try this place though we knew nothing of it and had never seen the menu. It turned out to be exactly what we wanted. The meals were great and not overpriced. We brought our own wine and had some of theirs making it all very nice and affordable for four. The service was just perfect. Thank you!
