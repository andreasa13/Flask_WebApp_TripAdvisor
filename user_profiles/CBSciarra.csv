The Positive Was That We Landed Safely,"Needing to get to Athens from New York, flying through Rome seemed a logical way to get there (less layover time and a very short second flight) so Alitalia was a logical choice. I booked two Magnifica Class seats for my husband and I, read reviews (which I always try to read many of as, of course, everyones opinions are different) and felt that it would be fine. The check in at JFK was pleasant so all seemed off to a good start. That is until the lounge. The Alitalia lounge at JFK is a disgrace, outdated, dirty and lacking in any amenities. We boarded the plane, the interior was dated and worn but overall looked fine. The seats were comfortable and roomy. The crew on the plane clearly did not want to be there. Rude, dismissive and couldn't be bothered to even be asked for water. Dinner was served (the food was pretty good) and then they all vaporized, nobody could be found for even a simple request. It was an overnight flight so not the worst thing. We landed early (which was nice), made our connection to Athens (again, very dicey interior on the flight, but it's very short flight). On the return trip, again, the flights were on time (which was wonderful as we were making a connection) but the check-in desk in Athens could not have been ruder if they tried! Again, the two Alitalia planes we were on had the same issue. I noticed more as they were daytime flights, the interior was very worn. The food was good but again, the staff was unavailable (I asked for a Vodka with soda water only to be told that they don't have Vodka on the plane. I know that the flight attendant didn't want to go to another cabin to get it!) Since there are so many European carriers and American carriers that fly to Europe, I would suggest to never waste your time with Alitalia Business class. Expensive business product that is not worth it at all.",October 2019,Alitalia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Airline_Review-d8729018-Reviews-Alitalia,World,flights,1.0,3.0
Eh.....,"After having such amazing food in Athens and Santorini, we tried Sphinx at the recommendation of our hotel and some others. Maybe it was just an ""off night"" since it was a Wednesday but our appetizers were simply ""eh"" at best (my husband had a Scallops appetizer with three scallops that were the size of nickels served on inedible seaweed that was smoked with an awful odor for 21 euro!), I had an traditional Greek egg-based appetizer that was much different that it was described and very much a breakfast dish. I had pasta for dinner and my husband had fish, both of which were just ok. The waiter was unpleasant (which was the opposite of everyone else we had encountered on the island) so that made dinner seem very long. All in all, there are so many restaurants in the area, I personally wouldn't recommend this one.",October 2019,Sphinx Wine Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d10219113-Reviews-Sphinx_Wine_Restaurant-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,2.0,4.5
Perfect Place for Tapas,"We had spent the day on a boat but were a little hungry later at night. We went to Melitini (without a reservation) and they were very accommodating and nice. The tapas was fantastic (don't be fooled by the word tapas, everything we ordered was very hearty and the portions were wonderful), the prices were very reasonable and the food was great. Definitely recommend!",October 2019,Melitini,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d6467764-Reviews-Melitini-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Top Notch,"We were referred to Fino by the concierge at out hotel when we asked for something ""not too touristy."" Wow! The owners, waiters and bartenders could not have been nicer, the service was perfect and the food was truly fantastic and innovative. We liked it so much, we ended up eating there three different nights and were so happy that we did. Highly, highly recommend!!!",October 2019,Fino Cocktail Bar & Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482941-d6896798-Reviews-Fino_Cocktail_Bar_Restaurant-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Heaven on Earth,"My husband and I decided about a month prior to take a trip to Greece and chose Santorini as our destination. One of the best decisions we ever made. Canaves Oia Suites was the perfect place to rest and just enjoy life. The suite (we were in a Pool Suite) was fabulous, the staff was so, so nice and so helpful, the view is incredible and the location is very convenient to get anywhere in the village. Not only do I highly recommend, we are planning another visit next year. Wonderful!",October 2019,Canaves Oia Suites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g482941-d9456057-Reviews-Canaves_Oia_Suites-Oia_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html,"Santorini, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
Awe Inspiring,"Worth every step up the (large) hill, the views are fantastic and the history is fascinating. The walk down is much easier and stopping at the Acropolis Museum is worth the trip!",October 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Awesome,"Having been to many different ruins throughout the world, we approached the Parthenon (our first visit) expecting more of the ""same."" We were fantastically surprised. The area is beautiful, the sites truly awesome and the walk very refreshing. The only drawback is that it would not be easy to navigate for people with compromised ability to walk up uneven paths, hills and slippery surfaces.",October 2019,Parthenon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198711-Reviews-Parthenon-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5

Simply Fabulous!,"My husband and I recently spent one night here (10/21-22) en route to Santorini. We had booked a suite but when we checked in were told that we were to be upgraded. Upgraded we were! I believe the suite was the same size, however, we had balconies that directly overlooked the Parliament building and the Acropolis. The view was heavenly, the room was fantastic and the service could not have been better. We had dinner at Tudor Hall in the hotel and everything was wonderful. The concierge readily recommended restaurants for lunch and both were spectacular. We highly recommend The King George, incredible rooms, wonderful staff and perfect location.",October 2019,"King George, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Athens",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d276262-Reviews-King_George_a_Luxury_Collection_Hotel_Athens-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Parahhhhhhdise,"To say that Hermitage Bay is paradise would be a huge understatement. It is truly heaven on earth. From the airport pickup onward, everything we experienced was beyond expectations. Our room (Suite 23) was beautiful with a wonderful view and beautiful pool. It was very private and always exceptionally well attended. The restaurant (yes, there is only one but donâ€™t let that fool you!) was incredible, the food fabulous and the variety changing constantly. Whether breakfast, lunch or dinner, the menu changed everyday during our weeklong stay. The quality and imagination of the food was comparable to anything we find her in Northern NJ or NYC. The bar area has amazing views and a wonderful atmosphere. The staff of the restaurant and bar deserve many kudos. To name some of our personal favorites are: Antony, Annette, Geron, Jamool, Linda, Michael, Casie, Shadey, Rozlyn, Shaneka and Zeke, just to name a few! They were all incredible, friendly, fun and so welcoming. Just fantastic people! The beach was quiet, clean and peaceful. The service on the beach and the main pool was incomparable. Everyone and everything was wonderful. We will be returning very soon!!!",January 2019,Hermitage Bay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1184718-d634067-Reviews-Hermitage_Bay-Saint_Mary_s_Antigua_Antigua_and_Barbuda.html,Antigua,hotels,5.0,5.0
Fabulous!,"The resort is nothing short of amazing. The amenities are wonderful, the staff is helpful and friendly, the restaurants are excellent and the rooms (although they could use a little modernizing face-lift) are large and well appointed. We just returned from a 6-night stay and will definitely be back. With a very special thank you to Tom (Concierge) for making everything we wanted to do work with seemingly no effort at all, from excursions to dinner reservations to advice about the island, he was a wealth of knowledge and know-how. We were even treated to learning how a pig is prepared for luau (they have people smoke it right on the grounds the day of the hotel's luaus, Wednesdays and Sundays, near the beach. They start preparing around 7:30 a.m.) by the people who have been doing it for the hotel for 20 or so years. They were friendly and wonderful! Great gym, stunning grounds, several pools, including a lagoon pool (we never didn't get a pool-side lounge chair if we wanted to!) and adult pool areas as well...cannot say enough great things about this resort!",January 2018,Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60625-d87364-Reviews-Grand_Hyatt_Kauai_Resort_Spa-Poipu_Kauai_Hawaii.html,"Kauai, Hawaii",hotels,5.0,4.5

Only OK,"Of all the restaurants we ate at while in Kauai, this was our least favorite. It wasn't that the food was bad or the staff wasn't great, it just wasn't what we were looking for in Kauai. Living in the NYC area, it's also hard to expect authentic Italian food on an island!",January 2018,Dondero's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g29218-d519765-Reviews-Dondero_s-Kauai_Hawaii.html,"Kauai, Hawaii",restaurants,3.0,4.0

The pulled pork sandwich and the bahn mi (ahi) were especially wonderful!

The Worst,"Having stayed at The Borgata many times, we decided to try the more ""low key"" option of the Water Club. Upon checking in, we were delighted upon finding the much less crowded valet and the comparative ease of the front desk check in. That changed quickly. Our $500+ per night (weekend rate) Club Room was beat up. That wasn't the worst of it. After seeing a show (in the hotel), eating (at the hotel) and gambling (at the hotel) we went up to the room at 1 am only to find that the bed was made up with only a top sheet (too small to tuck under the mattress). We thought this must be a mistake and called housekeeping. I was rudely informed that they will not deliver a sheet, only blankets or pillows. I inquired as to why there was only one sheet and a duvet. The woman said ""that's how it is"" and essentially hung up on me. Afterwards, I phoned the front desk to explain the situation and was met with the same responses. When I asked what was going to happen as we slept and the sheet would move around, leaving us sleeping on a bare mattress that thousands of others have slept on, I was answered with silence. We ended up driving home at 2 am. I will never waste any money there again. You'd be better off staying in an hourly rate motel, it would be cleaner.",July 2017,The Water Club Hotel at Borgata,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g29750-d1086020-Reviews-The_Water_Club_Hotel_at_Borgata-Atlantic_City_New_Jersey.html,"Atlantic City, New Jersey",hotels,1.0,4.0
wow!,"Without a doubt, the best BBQ we've ever had. Sitting at the bar helped us ""skip"" the long line, as you can order there but must eat there. The bar isn't a place to sit with kids, would wait on line and get a table if with children or more than 2 or so adults. The pulled pork, brisket and fried chicken were amazing as were the beans and collard greens. I'm certain whatever is ordered will be fabulous. Highly recommend and will definitely be back!",April 2017,Pecan Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g55711-d2640654-Reviews-Pecan_Lodge-Dallas_Texas.html,"Dallas, Texas",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Wonderful Stay,"As has been typical of our visits to Ritz Carlton Hotels all over the world, the hotel was luxurious and wonderful. We wanted to thank the staff in Dallas as we stayed there last weekend, oblivious to the fact that the Women's Final Four was being held in Dallas. The hotel was packed, as you'd expect and we weren't able to be accommodated on the concierge floor that we had booked. The hotel went above and beyond making sure that we had lounge access and sent up chocolate covered strawberries as well. Very hospitable staff and a great experience.",April 2017,"The Ritz-Carlton, Dallas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g55711-d659532-Reviews-The_Ritz_Carlton_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html,"Dallas, Texas",hotels,5.0,4.5
A Thanksgiving Getaway,"The hotel would have easily gotten six stars from us. The front desk, concierge, suite and the service were all impeccable. However, in a city of AMAZING restaurants, we decided that one night, we would eat in the hotel at La Rive. Having been told by the hotel staff (and online recommendations) that it was not to be missed, we headed to the restaurant. It was empty at the time and the maitre'd sat us at the exit door at a ""downsized"" table that was still meant to seat 4-6 people. My husband and I would have looked absurd sitting there. We politely asked the maitre'd to be moved to another table, to which he responded ""there aren't any others, all have been reserved."" We found it hard to believe that ALL the tables were specifically reserved, so we inquired at the concierge. He came down to ask the maitre'd (who was rude to him) and refused to move us to any other table that would have been suitable for two in the empty restaurant. We decided that we had enough and left to dine elsewhere (Bord'eaux is not to be mossed!). The staff of the hotel could not have been nicer or more apologetic and they were wonderful. I believe that the restaurant is separate from the hotel (although I believe still owned by InterContinental) and as I said, the hotel bent over backwards to try to help us. All in all, The Amstel is one of the best hotels in the world with top notch everything, except of course, their ""fine dining"" restaurant. The bar and bar staff, however, is amazing. We will be back again.",November 2016,InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g188590-d190614-Reviews-InterContinental_Amstel_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",hotels,4.0,4.5
Humbling,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to the museum, but I cannot explain how glad we were that we did. This was my second time in Amsterdam and I missed it the first time.
