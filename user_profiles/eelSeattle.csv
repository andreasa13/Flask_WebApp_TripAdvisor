Got caught up in all the hype...,"We have enjoyed their wines for some years, so a visit to the Ferrari-Carano Winery was meaningful. Unfortunately, we got caught up in all the hype (as the Caranos would hope) and bought way too many bottles. However, our traveling companions were already club members, so our treatment was top shelf, and they charged our wines to get the substantial discounted prices. The grounds really were spectacular.",September 2019,Ferrari-Carano Winery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32482-d116656-Reviews-Ferrari_Carano_Winery-Healdsburg_Sonoma_County_California.html,"Healdsburg, California",attractions,4.0,4.5
If you like beer and noise...,"After a wonderful day of touring a number of wineries, the Russian River Brewing Company would not have been our first as a dinner venue. However, never having been to Santa Rosa before, we relied upon our traveling companions who frequent the area often. If you like beer and noise, then this could be your cup of tea. We enjoy neither beer nor noise, but we give this restaurant a decent rating because it clearly was popular and the food was tasty. Ambience leaves something to be desired since big is not necessarily better, and elbow-to-elbow crowds do not work for us. We did not have a reservation, so got one of the worst tables next to the hostess podium.",September 2019,Russian River Brewing Company,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33055-d908768-Reviews-Russian_River_Brewing_Company-Santa_Rosa_Sonoma_County_California.html,"Santa Rosa, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5

They had a private parking area a block away, and a number of restaurants were within easy walking distance. The historic half of the hotel (which is where we stayed) had character, while the carriage house across the street was newer construction. We reserved early to get a better choice of rooms.

The Metropolitan Grill provides us with a very good, reasonable option for continuing to enjoy fine food delivered to our home. No need to unnecessarily be exposed to any germs. Just pop the ready-to-heat/bake food in the oven. On several occasions, I have enjoyed the King Salmon entree and Grilled Asparagus side. Sadly, I could only imagine how wonderful the Crab Cakes and Crab Crusted Halibut were tasting.

An extraordinary gastronomic experience...,"Restaurant Fangst was located in the basement of our hotel - The Saga Hotel Oslo. Although the menu offered a nice variety of à la carte options, it had been recommended that we choose omakase - a meal where the customer leaves it up to the chef to select five or eight dishes. We opted for the five dishes, plus wine pairings which ended up being totally perfect. The culinary skills of Chef Håkan Wiik were on full display. For an incredible evening of fine dining in a relaxed, casual environment and an extraordinary gastronomic experience, Restaurant Fangst was truly wonderful.

An Italian food jackpot...,"Dal Baffo Ristorante Bar Italiano was truly a relatively undiscovered gem in Merida. It can proudly take credit for being amongst the very best Italian restaurants in the area. Their pasta was all homemade and freshly prepared on a daily basis. We had the pleasure of dining there several times previously and always tried different dishes...tagliatelle with various ingredients and sauces, caprese salad, eggplant parmigiana to name a few. Adding a nice bottle of Barbera wine, panna cotta dessert or some limoncello just rounded out the dining experience. We found Dal Baffo Ristorante Bar Italiano to be an Italian food jackpot.

Parco Urbano Karol Wojtyla, named after Pope John Paul II, provided a great change of pace from the bustling streets of Foggia. This beautifully landscaped and well-maintained park, with its promenade and multiple water features, was a wonderful large open welcoming space in the middle of the city. However, with the exception of a number of dog walkers, there were surprisingly few others enjoying the place.

Opened up restaurant early just for me...,"Apparently in Foggia, many restaurants normally open at 12 Noon or later, and those which served a breakfast seemed to close early. So finding one which was both open and served any food at 11am had been virtually impossible. My train departing Foggia for Lecce was at 1:22pm. Having not eaten much breakfast, I had been walking around the streets with my luggage for several hours looking for an open restaurant before coming upon Nikita. They were clearly still closed but I stopped to inquire if they could suggest someplace which was open for lunch. I explained my situation and the waiter walked me back to a dining area and opened up early just for me. Although I honestly cannot now recall what they prepared for me, I do know that the food and drink was great. As the waiter prepped the other tables for opening and did his side work, he was both friendly and engaging. It was my final impression of Foggia and certainly made a positive one...left a ""good taste"" so to speak!

Oldest church in Salzburg...,"Small but strikingly impressive, Michaelskirche (St. Michael's Church) dates from about 780 and is the oldest church in Salzburg. It served as both the imperial chapel and parish church until the 12th century and had different entrances to two completely separate floors. The upper floor was intended for the emperor and his entourage and the lower floor for citizens of the city. The altars are beautifully decorated with paintings of the Archangel Michael conquering Lucifer in the center and of the two archangels, Gabriel and Raphael, to either side.

Deserves a rating of less than zero...,"If Al Giordano B&B had followed through with their emailed promises, then the stay at their establishment would probably have been very good. However, from the onset, it was a terrible experience.

The B&B's reservation page stated that check-in ends at 17:00 daily. So, being a responsible traveler and wanting to avoid problems, I emailed them slightly over a month in advance and advised them that ""my train...arrives at 17:19. Will this be a problem for check-in?"" Their immediate reply was, ""Good morning, No problem, dont' [sic] worry [smiley face]."" When I arrived by taxi from the train station, the main door to the building was locked, and there was no response to the B&B buzzer. I waited, and buzzed, and waited, and buzzed, and finally made calls to my spouse who was also traveling but in another part of Italy to obtain the B&B's phone number. After several attempts to reach them, someone finally answered and indicated that he would come to the B&B. I continued to wait on the street door stoop until another building resident let me enter and then sat on the floor in front of the B&B's second floor door. Finally, Valerio arrived and checked me into my room at 8:10pm!!!

The room was actually very nice, clean and appeared to have been recently renovated. It had a narrow, but usable, balcony which was a good extra. However, because there was a restaurant/bar directly below, the drunken conversations and noise was annoying. I had been given verbal directions for where to go to get the second ""B"" of B&B. But when I arrived and explained that I had been sent from Al Giordano B&B, they advised that there would be a charge for anything except a roll and coffee...wonderful! To top it off, checkout was exactly at 10am. Even though they were three hours late in letting me into my room, there would be no extension of the checkout time, so I dragged my luggage around Foccia until my 1:22pm train to Lecce. This property deserves a rating of less than zero, but in fairness, the room was very nice, albeit expensive, and the location quite central to the city center.",October 2019,AL Giordano B&B,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187876-d15521047-Reviews-AL_Giordano_B_B-Foggia_Province_of_Foggia_Puglia.html,"Foggia, Italy",hotels,2.0,4.0
"Spartan, no-frills interior but very good food...","Looking for a nice restaurant for dinner, I happened upon Trattoria del Cacciatore. It was brightly lit from the outside and appeared suitably inviting. It made no difference to me that there were no other customers on a Tuesday evening after 8pm. The restaurant had a modern, spartan, no-frills interior, so not a lot of atmosphere, but was clean and served very good food. Service was understandably excellent but also extremely helpful and friendly. Including the obligatory table cover charge, the total cost of my tasty entree, side salad, liter of water and several glasses of wine was 18.50 euro...quite reasonable.

Private pool for our suite...,"Le Chanthou Boutique Hotel was perfectly situated in a safe, quiet residential neighborhood adjacent to the bustling, high-traffic tourist area. As such, we were close enough to access Siem Reap Central and the madness of Pub Street via the hotel's courtesy tuk tuk but far enough away to avoid all the noise and hoards of people.

The hotel and grounds were constantly being cleaned and visually impressive and inviting. The staff were totally accommodating and extremely friendly. They even accepted some suggestions and constructive criticism. As an example, during one of the several times we had dinner at the hotel, we noticed that their large plants were covered with dust, as was some of the woodwork. We simply mentioned our observations to the manager, and the following day, the restaurant was immaculate. Since we regularly enjoyed white wine with our meals and during sun breaks by the pool and non-touring days, the bar staff always had a cold bottle for us in the refrigerator...very nice. Breakfast was included, with made-to-order entrees, fresh fruit, etc. and was quite tasty. It sometimes took a while because everything was freshly prepared, but we just enjoyed our teas, coffees and juices for laid-back morning dining. Although it was easy to go to the Pub Street tourist heaven for the myriad of sit-down restaurants and food carts which we opted to do several times during our stay, we also chose to eat at the hotel for some dinners. We especially enjoyed the Khmer foods like the fried rice in pineapple and red chicken curry, but as westerners we appreciated being able to get fresh, mixed green salads which were wonderful. Snacking on spring rolls by the hotel pool was also a treat.

We needed to book several rooms because our brother joined us on the trip. The Premier Suite overlooking the hotel pool was not too shabby, but for us, the King Suite with adjoining private pool was absolutely amazing. It was great to be able to enjoy a bottle of wine by our pool before bedtime and after a full day of touring. Their room rates were surprisingly reasonable for what we considered to be a first-class property.

For Siem Reap, Le Chanthou Boutique Hotel certainly deserved more than their three-star rating, and we look forward to booking there once again when we return to the area.",January 2020,Le Chanthou Boutique Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297390-d11924637-Reviews-Le_Chanthou_Boutique_Hotel-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",hotels,5.0,5.0

Have your passport beautifully stamped and officially dated...,"The City of San Marino was one of the most unique, incredible places in the world. Yes, it did indeed rely upon tourist traffic, but in that regard, it was not unlike London, Paris, New York City, Rome and Tokyo which many of us still choose as travel destinations. From the moment of entering San Marino by bus and walking past some of the city's ramparts to my hotel, there was an overwhelming sense of being immersed in history and hearkening back to medieval times.

For those who will visit, I would offer three suggestions. First, if practical, purchase a multi-museum pass which is valid for one entry to First Tower, Second Tower, the three primary galleries/museums and the Public Palace if Parliament is not in session. This ticket is valid for ten days from date of entry to your first attraction, so it provided the most flexibility to avoid the crowds and leisurely tour at my own pace. Second, make sure to wear comfortable shoes. Not only are there distances between some attractions like the Towers, but also the city is built across/on a hillside which required walking throughout. Third, the Republic of San Marino does not require a tourist visa to enter the country. However, for five euro, you can obtain a unique souvenir of your visit to San Marino. Have your passport beautifully stamped and officially dated at the Tourist Information Office. It is a gorgeous reminder of my wonderful visit to the oldest surviving sovereign state and constitutional republic in the world.",October 2019,Centro Storico Di San Marino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187809-d7053806-Reviews-Centro_Storico_Di_San_Marino-City_of_San_Marino.html,"City of San Marino, San Marino",attractions,5.0,4.5
Lots to see but lines everywhere..,"Fascinating glimpse into history with lots to see. If one did not have to wait in lines to visit portions of this huge attraction, then several hours could easily have been enough time to enjoy the exhibits, art, artifact and activities. That said, I just carried energy bars, skipped stopping for snacks/food and managed to be in the short lines when most of the normal masses needed to take their lunch and dinner breaks. Buy the more expensive ticket which includes entry into everything because it's less hassle and you'll want to see it all anyway. If you have the flexibility, then consider spreading out your Duomo visit over the number of days covered by your ticket.

As an aside, beneath the existing Duomo - Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore are the preserved vestiges of the old basilica of Santa Reparata.

Definitely not for tourists...,"The sole purpose for the vacation visit to Florence was to enjoy its renown beauty and charm and to leisurely explore some of its famous attractions. Unfortunately, the Hilton Florence Metropole was not suited to complement or support this purpose. By its mere location which was well outside the city core, the hotel could not even adequately compensate with their shuttle bus. In its defense, the hotel does publicize that their shuttle drops guests at the train station in the city center. However, they conveniently mask the fact that the purported five-minute walk is a much longer one thru back roads and walkways from the bus stop to the train station...not to the city center or any of the tourist destinations. When visiting as a tourist, it is highly normal to not be on fixed time schedules and to tour at one's leisure. By requiring hotel guests to purchase/reserve a shuttle bus ticket in advance (preferably per the hotel the day before), it substantially restricted any flexibility. At least we should have been able to expect some semblance of reliability, even given the hotel's disclaimer about not accepting responsibility for delays, etc., but one evening their 7pm bus from city center back to the hotel did not even show up until after 9pm and only then after numerous complaint calls to the hotel. A number of us therefore missed accessing the Executive Lounge before it had closed, and the hotel was totally unapologetic and uncaring.

As a Hilton property, regardless for business or tourism, the Hilton Florence Metropole was really only a mediocre hotel. It was badly in need of renovation or maybe even demolition and re-building. The hotel room was spartan, water pressure in the shower was either only warm or hot and then just a trickle. The internet throughout the hotel was not particularly good but from the room it was worse - unstable and inconsistent. Overall, the hotel staff was professional and helpful. When the hotel tried to overcharge my room at a 43% higher rate, the front desk graciously corrected the problem...especially when I provided them with a printed copy of my emailed confirmation. So if one is traveling on business where your company is picking up the tab, paying for taxis or a rental car and wasting time getting to/from destinations in the city is not an issue, then this hotel might fill the bill.

The stays were superb...,"We selected the Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok for its good location and proximity to public transportation and local attractions and were not disappointed. The hotel was well-maintained and basically felt secure.

To a person, the Front Desk staff were excellent. On a daily basis, before we left the hotel, they would provide advice as to expected large local gatherings and areas we should avoid within the city. Our experience with the hotel's restaurant, however, was not stellar, but the breakfast buffet was excellent. A nice blending of East and West tastes provided a great variety of foods, and made-to-order items were also available. They even brought out gluten free breads for us upon request. We have reviewed the Eagle's Garden Restaurant separately.

We understand that the hotel's owner loves the player piano music from the bar area, which was actually quite nice. However, the volume should be lowered so as not to negatively impact conversations taking place at the Front Desk. At times, one needed to almost yell to be heard. Also, because the hotel is cornered on well-trafficked streets, we observed a number of locals enter the hotel, seat themselves in the lobby and/or bar areas, and proceed to enjoy various food items from their shopping bags, purses, etc. in the presence of hotel guests trying to themselves enjoy snacks and drinks. There should probably be better control over the wandering locals. All in all, the several times we were at the Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok during our recent trip, the stays were superb. Although it is now highly unlikely that we will ever return to Hong Kong, we wish the hotel good fortune and especially the staff Godspeed in these challenging times both in your region and worldwide.",November 2019,Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294217-d11772135-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Hong_Kong_Mongkok-Hong_Kong.html,"Hong Kong, China",hotels,5.0,4.0
Very tasty Cantonese food but a cafeteria ambience...,"During our several stays at the hotel, we opted to dine in for evening meals. The chef must have been very good because our Cantonese dishes were always quite tasty. Service, however, was another matter entirely. The only excellent service was provided by Eric Yuen. The other servers, including a sourpuss who we believe was a manager, should just have stayed home. As for atmosphere, the ambience of a cafeteria would be better. From the glaring bright lights turned all the way up to the blaring, piped-in player-piano music from the downstairs bar/lobby, the restaurant was actually unpleasant. If the hotel management actually cares about attracting clientele who enjoy fine Cantonese dining, and especially at the somewhat elevated prices, they should make some subtle changes for their dinner service. Perhaps providing different uniforms for the wait staff, other than the same ones worn to serve the morning breakfast buffet, might also be classier. The 20% discount on food (not including alcohol) for hotel guests was a nice touch, but then they add 10% back on the non-discounted total.

Probably a very good Hilton property during normal times...,"After more than several months, we were finally able to book a domestic flight back to the US from Mexico. The airline connections were spotty and forced us to overnight in Miami. Fortunately, the Hilton Miami Airport Blue Lagoon had just re-opened several days earlier, but it was clear that they needed to do a lot of fine tuning. Upon arrival at the airport, we called the hotel and listened to the recorded instructions regarding their shuttle which would be running continuously every 30 or so minutes. However, after waiting in excess of 50 minutes, we spoke directly with a hotel employee who indicated that she would advise the shuttle driver and that we should look for a car...not a van or bus. When the bus...not a car...arrived, the driver told us that we had needed to CALL the hotel to arrange for airport pick-up. We might still have been waiting! The hotel had signs posted throughout which advised that face coverings were required in the hotel public areas. It is one thing to post signs and yet another to actually enforce compliance. Although the hotel employees all had face coverings, most of the people which we presume were guests did not! Social distancing in the lobby was not even enforced. We are senior citizens and had not been out in public for almost three months before this trip to try to get home and were very disturbed by the lack of attention to enforcement of safety precautions. We appreciated the upgrade to a very nice suite since we literally spent our entire time in the room. Since their restaurant was closed and there was no room service, we ordered food delivered as well as some wine. The hotel front desk was kind enough to provide a list of nearby restaurants. Prices in the hotel's ""grab and go"" store were more than astronomical, but breakfast in the morning was quite reasonable since it was covered by our status. The few employees which were visible were all quite friendly and helpful, and the hotel appeared very clean and ready to accept guests again.

A feast...,"The docent at the Public Palace recommended we have dinner at Ristorante Bolognese, and a disappointment it was not. We would probably not have found this relatively small, quiet restaurant on our own, as there were so many dining options in San Marino, and restaurant hawkers, from whom we normally stay away. were everywhere.

On recommendation of my hotel, Il Ristorante Beccafico was very accommodating. They were quite full and very busy, but the service was excellent, food very good and prices more than reasonable.

The food was definitely a step above that which was seemingly available near the station and actually quite tasty. Since I was there for lunch at Noon, there were few other patrons, and the wait staff seemed involved with other matters. For Chicken Fried Rice, a beverage and the mandatory cover charge per table, the $14 USD was pretty steep. Nice, clean surroundings and decor, as well as clean restrooms, were a plus.

It is smaller in size compared to other royal complexes such as Thailand's, so walking around was actually easier. Upon paying the entrance fee, there were English-speaking tour guides available for a set price. This was pleasant and thus eliminated any haggling or feelings of price creep for Westerners. As expected, the grounds were immaculate and buildings well maintained. The Silver Pagoda was interesting but did not quite live up to all the hype. It was naturally the most crowded attraction of the Royal Palace complex. We were actually quite impressed by the beautiful murals adorning the interior walls of the pagoda complex.

Perfect outing to get away from Phnom Penh madness...,"A later pick-up at our hotel was negotiated with the tour operator, so that we could enjoy our breakfast. As it turned out, we had the entire boat to ourselves which was wonderful, and our English-speaking guide was both entertaining and informative. They normally provide unlimited beer and soft drinks, but since we do not drink beer, they gladly offered to stop and buy wine for us. That was a very nice gesture, but we were good and drank water the entire day...so much healthier for us. Fresh fruits were served both going up river and down. Taking in the scenes along the banks of the Tonle Sap River was really fun and educational. Although the first stop at Koh Chen Island and the village of silversmiths was not without additional voluntary monetary outlay, the silver handicrafts were astoundingly beautiful and will serve as special holiday gifts in December.

After a brief lunch stop to enjoy a sampling of local cuisine, we were off to experience the former Cambodian royal capital city of Oudong, as well as the largest Buddhist center in the country. We took our time climbing up to see the burial sites of former kings, but the views from atop were spectacular and worth the effort. And the return boat ride was especially nice after the long day to just hang out, hydrate and relax.

Patronized by professionals and embassy staff...,"The Bellevue Serviced Apartments were perfect for our four-night visit to Cambodia's capitol city. Removed from the primary tourist areas but close enough to easily and quickly become immersed in the Phnom Penh scene when desired, our spacious two-bedroom apartment with full kitchen was ideal. Although we dined out several times during our stay, we also took full advantage of our cooking facilities for snacks, beverages, lunches and dinners. Our complimentary hot breakfasts were tasty, varied daily and were delivered directly to our apartment at times of our choosing. Entry to the property from the main road was secured by gates and guards, so safety was never a concern. Since we learned that the apartment complex was patronized by professionals and embassy staff who were either visiting or employed at the numerous foreign missions, it was not surprising that the property appeared prominently on all our maps and that our shared-services drivers knew exactly where to go. Our primary staff contact was with their Front Desk personnel, who were quite friendly and helpful. There was a small store on property which carried a limited selection of food items and sundries but most importantly carried some nice wines. The hotel pool was definitely a plus. Not only was it always clean but mostly devoid of other people...probably because they were working during the day.

However, we found The Central Cafe to be a refreshing, pleasant dining option for a more traditional meal. Our dinner items included Stir-fried Morning Glory, Grilled Squid, Grilled Marinated Pork, Beef Skewer, Mixed Green Salads, Deep-fried Spring Rolls and a Seafood Vermicelli Salad.

Part of tour-guide routing but for a reason...,"After visiting five Angkor temples on what was probably a typical itinerary, we thankfully stopped for lunch. The Khmer Village Restaurant was our destination. Already clearly packed with tourists, we were directed to an enclosed dining area with AC. This restaurant was obviously part of a tour-guide routing system. However, as we discovered, it was for a reason. The service was attentive, food very good and prices a bit high for Cambodia but reasonable. Our orders of Vegetable Spring Rolls, Mango Salads, Fried Egg, Stir-fried Pork, Chicken Currry and steamed rice were quite tasty.

We had placed the order several weeks ahead of time to ensure they would be open, so we could set the date for a virtual birthday dinner party. We, of course, are obeying the local stay-at-home dictate. At 7:30pm, we confirmed that the order was in process but had not yet been sent out. By 8pm, when we connected with the other parties on the virtual dinner call who had received their delivered meals, ours still showed in process! At 8:10pm, we canceled the order from La Tratto Santa Lucia and quickly put together a frozen pizza at home. Luckily, we had our own bottle of wine and did not have to rely upon La Tratto.

An overview of primary temples and ancient buildings...,"While many visitors to Cambodia will not surprisingly immediately equate the country to the Angkor Wat temple and others may conjure up images of the Ta Prohm temple used in filming Tomb Raider starring Angelina Jolie, in actuality, this UNESCO World Heritage site encompasses over 400 square kilometers with hundreds of temples, ancient structures and monuments. We only visited some 25 sites but literally took hundreds of photos. However, rather than post reviews for each of the attractions we visited, we have chosen to simply provide an overview of primary temples and ancient buildings. There are more than a sufficient number of reviews and photos for specific Angkor attractions already here on Trip Advisor.

We purchased an Angkor World Heritage Pass for $62USD which was valid for use any three days within ten days from date of purchase. They take your picture which is imprinted on the pass, so it is non-transferable...and also serves as a great souvenir. Unless you are a temple junkie, three days is more than ample time to experience all of the Park's highlights. We made the good decision to retain a reputable tour guide, who also provided all transportation from and back to our hotel. Not to be missed of course are the Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm temples, as well as Angkor Thom City and its Bayon, Baphoun and Phimeanakas temples and remnants of the Royal Palace. Although a bit farther out from the primary cluster of Angkor temples, Banteay Srey was beautiful and well worth the 30-minute ride. There are a myriad of smaller, but no less impressive, temples to visit. Some of the ones which we enjoyed most were Bateay Samre, Ta Som, Pre Rup, Preah Khan, Neak Pean and Mebon temples. At varying points during our second and third days, there really was complete saturation and a return to our hotel pool for snacks, beverages and some relaxation was necessary. We also opted not to tour for three days in a row and instead were able to take a day off to do other Siem Reap exploration. However, make no mistake, as much as you choose to experience of Angkor Archaeological Park, it is well worth the time and effort. In this review, multiple photos of the temples are included for your viewing.

Be prepared for cats underfoot while dining...,"Quite touristy but still a decent Cambodian dining experience. We had heard about Titanic Restaurant from a friend, as well as one of our tour guides. Due to its incredible location alongside and overlooking the river, the view is difficult to replicate or beat. However, the nice visuals were not going to fill our bellies. Thankfully, the food was actually quite good...albeit a bit pricey. Several glasses of wine, Lemongrass Soup with Beef, Traditional Steamed Fish in Lime Juice, and a special order of Fish Amok (Kor Ku Soup with fish) made for a tasty dinner. If we had been more adventurous and not needed the foreigner touch, then there were a multitude of other dining options in the area.

A favorite of locals and entrance was easy to miss...,"The dining experience was luckily very nice but would have been substantially different if the restaurant known as Moon River had firstly not been suggested by our hotel, and secondly, if we had not gone with a local friend. Our hotel suggested and made advance reservations, so when we arrived to a very large, chaotic and packed Song Trang, we were pleased when shown to a more secluded, quiet table overlooking the river. Since little to no English was spoken by the staff, being there with our Vietnamese friend was a must. The restaurant is supposedly a favorite of locals and frequently hosts large groups and family celebrations. Since our visit was on a Friday night at the start of the Lunar New Year weekend, the restaurant had a wonderfully festive, electric atmosphere. Although we had received specific directions from our hotel to the restaurant, the entrance was easy to miss. We actually walked by several times. The meal we ordered was the equivalent of a family-style banquet and was excellent. With drinks and desserts, the total cost for the four of us was a whopping $32 USD!

There were no longer bell persons, but someone from the front desk needed to also serve as bellhops. The restaurant was separate from hotel operations, so there was literally no communication between departments. The Chinese intended to eliminate the typical hot buffet found in Scotland and replace it with a cold continental breakfast. Housekeeping had apparently been contracted out. Our suite, although upgraded, was very sparsely furnished and not particularly clean. The saving grace for the hotel was that it was located within a reasonable walking distance from the main tourist attractions.

We were a bit apprehensive that the Hilton might be located too far from Queenstown proper, but we knew we would have a rental car and decided not to worry. As it turned out, we would not need the car except for day tours outside of the immediate area. The resort had a water taxi service which transported guests to and from downtown Queenstown, and instead of $15 roundtrip, we just presented our room key and the fare was reduced to $5 each way. So the more secluded location allowed us to enjoy the sights and sounds of Queenstown and then leave the tourist mess behind and return to the tranquility of the resort. Our accommodations left nothing wanting. The fireplace, private balcony, elevated sleeping room and fantastic views of Lake Wakatipu and the mountains were perfect for kicking back over a nice glass of wine and snacks. We actually never chose to leave the serenity of the Hilton to go to town for dinners the entire week. There were three restaurants on property, and the food at each was very good to excellent.

The stark contrast, between the pristine European Arrowtown Village and where the Chinese miners were forced to live, was both telling and defining of the times.

Over the course of our two dinners, we were able to try their Prawn Wonton Soup with Vegetables, Steamed Whole Fish, Sauteed Lamb with Leeks, Chicken and Sweet Corn Soup, Fried Rice with Vegetables and Egg, Stir-fried Beef with Ginger and Spring Onions, and the Stir-fried Chicken in a Black Bean Sauce. All of the dishes were nicely presented and very savory. Although the atmosphere was nothing special, the restaurant was clean, bright and comfortable.",November 2018,Me&Mee Chinese Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255122-d3316137-Reviews-Me_Mee_Chinese_Restaurant-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html,"Queenstown, New Zealand",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Be adventurous and explore some ghost towns...,"We had planned an excursion from Queenstown to historic Arrowtown but decided to do some additional exploring in the general area. We had read about Bendigo, a gold-mining town occupied until the early 1900's, as well as several settlements deserted since the 1880's in the hills above. Although we did not expect to find anything close to a Hollywood set, we were clearly not sure what we would find. But we chose to be adventurous and explore some of these ""ghost towns"" from over a century ago. There was not much left of Bendigo, but Welshtown higher up the hill was replete with partial buildings and signs of prior occupancy. It was actually quite exciting to be able to step back over 100 years in time. Although we only had a Mazda rental car, the dry conditions allowed us to navigate the roads quite nicely. We would suggest, however, having an off-road vehicle to access these areas during inclement conditions. There were some striking views from where both Bendigo and Welshtown previously existed.",November 2018,Bendigo Historic Reserve,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g7909172-d7901138-Reviews-Bendigo_Historic_Reserve-Bendigo_Central_Otago_Otago_Region_South_Island.html,"Bendigo, New Zealand",attractions,5.0,5.0
Do not visit primarily for Kiwis...,"Although their name would suggest otherwise, do not visit the Kiwi Birdlife Park primarily to view the kiwis. You could be disappointed. We were not because the possibility of viewing kiwis, while certainly important, was not the only motivating factor for our visit. The fact that the park was home to not only kiwis but numerous endangered native bird species was of particular interest. We expected to see a rare black stilt, but it had unfortunately died prior to our visit. This attraction is entirely funded by admission fees and is heavily involved in rehabilitation, as well as breeding of national birds. We would have loved a photo of the kiwis while they were foraging for food, but the use of cameras was understandably strictly prohibited. The cost of admission, while not inexpensive, was worth contributing to the conservation efforts being undertaken by the Kiwi Birdlife Park. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and considered a return entry which was included in our admission fee but unfortunately neither had the time nor the opportunity during our short five-night stay in Queenstown.",November 2018,Kiwi Birdlife Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255122-d301158-Reviews-Kiwi_Birdlife_Park-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html,"Queenstown, New Zealand",attractions,4.0,4.5

Last-minute Thanksgiving menu option much appreciated...,"The location of Chateau on the Park - Christchurch, a DoubleTree by Hilton property was undeniably excellent given its proximity to the huge green open space of Hagley Park and the beautiful Botanic Gardens. We enjoyed being within a leisurely walking distance of attractions in Central Christchurch, such as the Canterbury Museum and Canterbury National Earthquake Memorial. We enjoyed a nice accommodation with a partial view of the Gazebo Gardens, and the hotel staff throughout were personable and helpful. They were no doubt taking their cue from David Wain, Hotel Manager...a nice guy. However, for us, the Certificate of Excellence should go to the Food & Beverage team.

Our complimentary full breakfast, especially the made-to-order omelette, was perfect. One morning we asked to see the full dinner menu, mainly curious what we might order for dinner that evening (which happened to be our Thanksgiving) and noticed they did not have any turkey on the menu. When we inquired of our server and explained the reason, she went to check with the Head Chef. Several minutes later, she returned to advise that they would be happy to prepare a dish from their special ""Christmas"" menu for our dinner. Upon our return from a full-day excursion to Akaroa and arrival for our dinner reservation, we were totally surprised to find that the Garden Court Brasserie restaurant was promoting availability of a full roast turkey dinner! Apparently, as a result of our inquiry at breakfast, they had arranged for the special dinner offering. Needless-to-say, the last-minute Thanksgiving menu option was not only very much appreciated but also the meal was excellent. Further, when we asked if there were any cranberries, sauce or jelly for the turkey, after some minutes of apparent search and destroy, our server returned with apologies from the chef. And then only after several more minutes, the chef himself returned with cranberry sauce. He explained that he knew they had some but that it had taken time for him to find it...amazing service! The following morning, the Head Chef thanked us because they had totally sold out the special dinner offering the previous evening. The thanks was really from us to all of them! For three days, we not only took every breakfast in the hotel but also all our dinners in either the restaurant or Den Bar Lounge. In our opinion, there was no need to explore other venues with the proven track record within the hotel. Also, in lieu of an Executive Lounge (which most DoubleTree-branded properties do not have anyway), the daily drink vouchers were nice.

Stop and smell the roses...,"We walked through the Christchurch Botanic Gardens at every opportunity going to and from our hotel and the attractions of the city. Photo ops within the gardens abound, but since we are particularly fond of roses, the Rose Garden was a definite draw. Although we did not take the time to do so in a single excursion, a complete tour of the gardens could probably take several hours. We instead preferred to frequently just stop and smell the roses when passing through.",November 2018,Christchurch Botanic Gardens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255118-d256992-Reviews-Christchurch_Botanic_Gardens-Christchurch_Canterbury_Region_South_Island.html,"Christchurch, New Zealand",attractions,4.0,4.5
Actually very depressing...,"The reminders of death and destruction from the earthquake were just too vivid. Although there was evidence of substantial rebuilding efforts and a city literally digging out, the visual realities of Christchurch Cathedral, Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Cathedral Square and surrounds was actually quite depressing.

Sadly powerful...,"The Canterbury Earthquake National Memorial was at the top of our list of Christchurch points of interest. While viewing the memorial and absorbing its sadly powerful message, we could not help but be moved by a number of people (mostly individual men) who were seated on the benches and quietly self-absorbed. We could only imagine who they may have lost. The urge to take photos of the memorial was superseded by the importance of not invading the aura of this special place. It shall be vividly engraved in our memories.

Well worth the voluntary donation for admission...,"If for nothing more than the Bird Hall exhibits, our visit to the Canterbury Museum was well worth the voluntary donation for admission. Having toured a multitude of museums worldwide, we have found that there tends to always be a singular exhibit or emphasis which stands out...aside from the spotlight on a unique local or national culture. Thus, the Maori exhibits were of course of interest. The ""Christchurch Street"" exhibit was a lot of fun. However, the amazing and realistic bird displays were far and above the singular most impressive gallery.",November 2018,Canterbury Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255118-d256993-Reviews-Canterbury_Museum-Christchurch_Canterbury_Region_South_Island.html,"Christchurch, New Zealand",attractions,5.0,4.5
Not just the formal museum but the town...,"Approaching Akaroa through the outlying French farmlands, we started to get a sense of the original French settlers in 1840. The Akaroa Museum exhibited much of the town's historic heritage. The museum housed the town's old courthouse, as well as the Langlois-Eteveneaux House, believed to have originated in France and was then assembled in Akaroa in 1841...impressive. A stroll through the town provided even more examples of historical importance in some of the preserved buildings. The Coronation Library and numerous homes along the streets of Akaroa served as testement. This excursion was well worth the drive from Christchurch.",November 2018,Akaroa Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g285727-d567002-Reviews-Akaroa_Museum-Akaroa_Canterbury_Region_South_Island.html,"Akaroa, New Zealand",attractions,5.0,4.0
Well-maintained memorial and manicured grounds...,"As war memorials go, the Banks Peninsula War Memorial and Grounds in the small town of Akaroa was well-maintained with manicured grounds surrounding.

A small lighthouse...,"It was a short climb up the hill to reach Akaroa Lighthouse. The fact that it was originally built in the late 1870's and relocated to its present site in 1980 speaks more to its historical importance than anything else.

"Kaikoura ""very good""...""Why Not Cafe"" ""average""...","This review is primarily for Kaikoura and surrounds, but we also lunched at the Why Not Cafe. Since we could not find a way on Trip Advisor to just review Kaikoura and the beautiful surrounding coastline, we have combined reviews here. First, we decided to drive from Nelson to Christchurch using Highway 1 along the coast. Although we were aware of possible delays due to road repairs from the 2016 earthquake, we decided to take the purported more scenic route. We were definitely not disappointed. The views of the Pacific Ocean, coastline and wildlife were wonderful. Kaikoura was the mid-way point to Christchurch and a perfectly great place to leisurely stroll along the water and through the town. When stopped at one of the road construction checkpoints, we were able to chat with the ""flagger"" and inquire of restaurants in Kaikoura. As a local, her recommendation for a reasonable and basic lunch menu was the Why Not Cafe. We took her suggestion...and why not? The cafe was actually quite busy with a mix of tourists and obvious locals. It was truly just a cafe, so do not expect anything impressive. We opted for basic fish and chips, which was actually quite tasty. The prices were also extremely reasonable and the service acceptable for a small, busy cafe.",November 2018,Why Not Cafe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255374-d726743-Reviews-Why_Not_Cafe-Kaikoura_Canterbury_Region_South_Island.html,"Kaikoura, New Zealand",restaurants,4.0,3.5
A Five-Star experience...,"The Harbourside Lodge and our hosts Cathy and David provided a Five-Star experience during our visit to the Nelson City and Tasman Bay Region. Although we had a rental car, the hotel was conveniently located only a short walk along the Maitai River to the center of Nelson. Cathy was a wealth of information and happily suggested all number of local attractions and eateries. The responsibility for the complimentary breakfast fell to David, who not only served up a nice buffet but also entertaining conversation. Knowing that we would be spending three nights in Nelson midway through our month-long trip to New Zealand, we pre-booked their very nice one-bedroom apartment with marina view many months in advance. We were not to be disappointed. Both the main living/dining room/kitchen and the separate bedroom with King bed were well-appointed, airy and spacious. Each had its own balcony with views of the marina and distant mountains. The available on-property laundry facilities were definitely a plus when traveling for extended periods on the road...and they even provided the detergent. Cathy's familiarity with the local tour operators was also most helpful when considering who to use and for which tours. We could not have asked for a better overall experience.",November 2018,Harbourside Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g255678-d638322-Reviews-Harbourside_Lodge-Nelson_Nelson_Tasman_Region_South_Island.html,"Nelson, New Zealand",hotels,5.0,5.0
World-class touring experience...,"As you can see from our travels and reviews, we have been lucky enough to have visited a fair portion of the civilized world. However, as relates specifically to wine tasting and vineyard tours, we can only count South Africa, France, Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Austria and even China, and of course the United States, amongst our wine tasting/vineyard tour experiences. We are admittedly not experts but very much savor a good vino. Among excursion options, Bay Tours Nelson advertised visits to varying numbers of wineries, depending upon one's tastes, time and desires. However, as anyone who has previously been on wine tours realizes, the selection and types of wines available for tasting at any given winery are solely up to the discretion of that particular winery...and not the tour operator. Owen provided a world-class touring experience with visits to Te Mania/Richmond Plains wineries, Brightwater Vineyards, Seifried Estate winery and Kahurangi Estate (for tasting and lunch). A stop at the Moutere Inn, the oldest pub in New Zealand still operating in its original building, was a great break from the wineries. Whenever possible, we stopped for some incredible vistas of Nelson and surrounds. We even had an opportunity to do some shopping for truly unique ornaments at the Eyebright Country Store Christmas shop. Simply put, there are not enough superlatives to describe Owen and Bay Tours Nelson. Without reservation, we would highly recommend any of their tours.",November 2018,Bay Tours Nelson,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g255678-d2005327-Reviews-Bay_Tours_Nelson-Nelson_Nelson_Tasman_Region_South_Island.html,"Nelson, New Zealand",attractions,5.0,5.0
