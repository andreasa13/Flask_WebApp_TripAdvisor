Bad booking experience,"During the first wave of the coronavirus crisis, when prices for vacation rentals were advertised at a reduced rate, we booked ahead for the Succot holiday. Itamar, the host, just notified us, 6 weeks before our booking date, that he is cancellingâ€¦ He suggested another place to stay in Amirim, but holidays prices in Israel are now peaking and he refused to compensate us for the price difference. We will definitely not book the Hamiel family property in the future.",August 2020,Hamiel Zimers in the Forest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g494964-d12832882-Reviews-Hamiel_Zimers_in_the_Forest-Amirim_Galilee_Region_Northern_District.html,"Amirim, Israel",hotels,1.0,1.0

A must visit!,"You absolutely cannot visit Athens without visiting the Acropolis! even if you aren't keen on archeology. It's impressive, can be seen from anywhere in town. Only a short walk from the centre of town. We happened to be there the first Sunday in March so entrance was free (!) but amazingly wasn't very crowded.",March 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Great view,Worth it for the trek and great views. Steep climb but if you are in good shape it's not very hard to go up by foot - it took us about 20-25 min from the base of the hill (stairs going through the neighborhood) all the way up to the top. We actually looked for the funicular but couldn't find it and just ended up walking on our own. Area at the top is quite small but wasn't very crowded when we were there.,March 2020,Mount Lycabettus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245989-Reviews-Mount_Lycabettus-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Special treat,"Upscale restaurant with reasonable prices. We are vegetarian and ordered the greek salad, taboulleh quinoa salad, chummus and french fries, all of which were delicious.

Tasty pastries and pizza with vegetarian options,"Smak was around the corner from our hotel, we read about it on TA and were glad we tried it out - my kids really loved the pizza here.

Great hotel in a fabulous location,"The hotel is marvelously located near Ermou shopping street and the Plaka. Walkable distance everywhere. Good price. Hotel is clean, beds are very comfortable and our family suite was very spacious. Wifi worked very well. Staff is very helpful. Breakfast was good although special omelet orders would be appreciated. Only down size is the noise from the street - not only of people and music but also cars, but just bring earplugs and book the hotel anyway! Our room was facing the main street, maybe rooms facing the quieter street are less noisy.",March 2020,Athens Manor Houses,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d17310104-Reviews-Athens_Manor_Houses-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5

Excellent 7 island tour,"We did the 7 island hopping tour from Phuket. The speedboat was well equipped, the staff very professional and friendly, photographing us throughout the tour and then posting all pictures on facebook for free download. We would have liked to spend more time at Koh Phi Phi island, the stop including a lunch break was short (only about 1 hour).",July 2019,Breezy Andaman,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297930-d13809864-Reviews-Breezy_Andaman-Patong_Kathu_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",attractions,5.0,4.5
An indulging experience!,"A truly luxurious resort. Even the simplest rooms had a huge bathroom and a huge balcony (their only downside was that there were quite a few stairs, but could also be serviced by using 2 sets of elevators, although it would take longer to get to the room). Excellent breakfast, dining room not too crowded and not noisy. Fun pool with water slide, tubes and entertainment. Nice clean beach on site. Staff very friendly. Only downside was that the services at the resort were expensive (restaurant, spa, taxi) and due to the secluded area of the resort, it was not easy to leave the resort on foot (we walked one day along Karon beach and after 15 min arrived at some Karon stores and restaurants, but this can only be done in flip-flops or water shoes).",July 2019,Centara Grand Beach Resort Phuket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1215780-d1793896-Reviews-Centara_Grand_Beach_Resort_Phuket-Karon_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great stay,"While we feel that the price for B&B was reasonable, the price for services while we were at the hotel (restaurant prices, taxis, spa etc.), was high, so we found alternatives.
We enjoyed the fact that the hotel was secluded but still close enough to walk to Patong center. It was great being nearby the beach but the beach is rocky and therefore not great for swimming, but nice to take a walk when the tide is out. For those who like swimming in the sea, Karon beach is better.",August 2019,Amari Phuket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297930-d305178-Reviews-Amari_Phuket-Patong_Kathu_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",hotels,5.0,4.5
Excellent experience,"My daughters and I came to Vayo three times during our stay in Patong, for massages, pedicures and gel manicures. Prices are very reasonable. 400-500b for 1 hr massage, and although public space with dividing curtains it wasn't busy and the atmosphere was relaxing and private. Gel manicure 800b (and they had a special going on at the time so we even received a discount) which isn't cheap in terms of the price back home but is on the low side of what we saw in other spa/nail salons. Service was excellent for all treatments.

Tasty but not cheap,"Had dinner there, ordered a medium size pizza with one topping (about 400+ baht) and two types of vegetarian spaghetti. Food was tasty but portions very small, not big enough for an adult meal. Medium pizza enough for 1-1.5 people. So comes out not cheap in thai standards.",August 2019,The Pizza Company - Bang La Phuket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1215781-d3958186-Reviews-The_Pizza_Company_Bang_La_Phuket-Phuket_Town_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",restaurants,3.0,3.5
Okay,"Had dinner there, after reading the raving reviews we expected more. The noodles were very very sticky and non edible. On the other hand, the spring rolls and the pineapple rice were good. Menu doesn't have very many items and almost everything contains tofu so if you don't like tofu this is not the place for you. Lastly, this is an open space that houses many eating places, the air smells of the different cooking, and the eating area of Yo Vegan is mixed with all the other eating places. Personally, as vegetarians we prefer not to smell the odor of seafood and meat when we eat.",August 2019,Yo Vegan Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297930-d12328850-Reviews-Yo_Vegan_Restaurant-Patong_Kathu_Phuket.html,"Phuket, Thailand",restaurants,3.0,4.5

Disappointing,"We had a car and driver for the day and wanted to go rafting (without an elephant tour). When we called waterrunner tours a few days before they said they had a short route of 5 km for 1200b (one hour net for rafting) and a long route of 10 km for 1600b (2 hour net for rafting) When we arrived the lady said that due to the rain of the day before, the river was a bit high and that they were oferring a 4 km rafting trip for 1200b and it would take about 10 min ride to get there plus another 40 min rafting. We paid and the driver took us with a guide. After 5-6 min he stopped to let us out. Nice guide but the net rafting time was only 30 minutes. Only 3-4 mediocre rapids. Seems we were ripped off. Not worth the money.",July 2019,Water Runner And Bobby's Elephant Home,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293917-d6154297-Reviews-Water_Runner_And_Bobby_s_Elephant_Home-Chiang_Mai.html,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",attractions,2.0,4.0
Okay but not much more,"We decided to try out this restaurant after being somewhat disappointed with its ""sister"" restaurant Vegan Heaven the night before. We ordered pumpkin soup which had baby food (puree) texture and had no taste (wasn't sweet or salty or much of anything). The rice with two different plates of stir fried vegtables was pretty good but nothing special. The french fries were good. The restaurant was pretty full when we came (9 pm on a sunday night) so we had to sit upstairs. There is a ceiling fan but it was still quite hot.",July 2019,Taste from Heaven - Vegetarian and Vegan Cooking School,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1308496-d1861280-Reviews-Taste_from_Heaven_Vegetarian_and_Vegan_Cooking_School-Chiang_Mai_Province.html,"Chiang Mai Province, Thailand",attractions,3.0,4.5
Just okay,"We stumbled upon this place by accident but before going in we quickly looked it up on tripadvisor and saw raving reviews. Unfortunately that got ours hopes up and we were disappointed. The vegan burger was mushy and not very tasty, the sweet potato fries were burnt. However, the ""chicken"" wrap was good. Didn't try any desserts.",July 2019,Vegan Heaven,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293917-d12572636-Reviews-Vegan_Heaven-Chiang_Mai.html,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",restaurants,3.0,4.5
