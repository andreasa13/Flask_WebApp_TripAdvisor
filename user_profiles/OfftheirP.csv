Very good as usual,"This is a regular restaurant that we visit and I consider it a good option. It has lots to offer including its Riverside location and an interesting and diverse menu.

Our seating was outside because it had to be but they’re done as good a job as possible really of making it a warm and cosy environment. Heaters were everywhere and it was quite sheltered.

The lamb in one of our dishes was very tough so I mentioned it to the waiter and it was swapped for an equivalent chicken dish with no fuss at all. I must say, the service throughout was excellent especially Emanuel who always really looks after us and is a lovely guy.

The rest of the food was really nice and contributed to a really nice evening overall.",May 2021,Scene Indian Street Kitchen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d8097496-Reviews-Scene_Indian_Street_Kitchen-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Glad that normal service is resuming,"This is one of our favourite parts of Manchester and we had a great time on our first visit since this latest lockdown.

It was busy but coped with the crowd well and the bars and restaurants with dealing with the outside dining very well. We stayed at the lawn club which was great. Blankets and heaters provided (they were needed!) and very reassuring in terms of the Covid measures taken.

These are difficult times but Spinningfields certainly has made the best of them and it was just lovely to be out and about again.",May 2021,Spinningfields,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187069-d5970826-Reviews-Spinningfields-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Enjoyable late afternoon,"We called in for an early dinner here and had a really nice time. Obviously, it isn’t cheap but that’s not what it aims to do. This place is all about class, feeling special and great food.

For the most part, it succeeded. My ribeye steak was really delicious but disappointing that £35 (including the 12 1/2% service charge) it didn’t come with any sides at all. Also, I have a thing about frozen chips in restaurants and these didn’t do the steak justice. The blackened cod was wonderful and I would probably have ordered that with hindsight. My wife loved hers.

The outdoor dining worked really well and we kept warm and dry throughout despite the Manchester rain. The service was particularly good – professional, friendly and not in the least bit stuffy.",May 2021,The Ivy Spinningfields,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d15532592-Reviews-The_Ivy_Spinningfields-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Something for everyone,"This is a place we’ve been to countless times over the years and you always see somewhere new whether it’s a bar, restaurant, history or music you will find it there.

We’ve seen several bands there and it makes a great natural amphitheatre for the sound. There really is something quite special about watching a band play in such beautiful surroundings with history all around it.

It is also a great place just to walk around and enjoy the boats and canals.",April 2021,Castlefield Bowl,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187069-d14827272-Reviews-Castlefield_Bowl-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5
Busy for excellent,"This was our first trip into Manchester this lockdown and it was excellent. That was helped a great deal by this place which, from the moment we checked in, made you feel safe and secure.

The service throughout was superb. Our waitress from South Shields was great fun but professional and really cared about you having a good time.

Ordering through the app was easy and the food arrived very quickly. The steak puddings were excellent and the same comment applies to the burgers.

They have a great range of drinks and, although it was really busy, everything just flowed and that is to the wharfs great credit.",April 2021,The Wharf,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d3327134-Reviews-The_Wharf-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Good but expensive,"This was our first trip into Manchester since lockdown and we had a great time. The Sun was shining and our first port of call was impossible.

Although it was early on a Thursday we still had to queue for our booking. This wasn’t a problem though as we soon got in securely through the track and trace system.From when we checked into when we left the service was excellent and the seating area at the back a lovely place to soak up the weather.

The only downside was the price and the drinks. You order them through the app and they are expensive. The standard lager is £5.50 a pint which is enough anyway but I think it is a bit much to add a 12.5% service charge to that.",April 2021,Impossible,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d12794001-Reviews-Impossible-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Manchester, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,3.5
Good but not cheap,"This was our first meal out after this latest lockdown and we had a nice time. The restaurant has done a great job of creating a comfortable, cosy yet Covid secure outdoor eating area and we felt we could relax there.

There are lots of heaters and blankets so keeping warm wasn’t a problem. The service throughout was excellent and was both professional and friendly.

The food was good rather than great but not cheap. With no starters, desserts or steaks involved our bill was over £120 for four people. No wine either just a few beers between us. We had a great time but the cost would probably put us off going again for awhile.",April 2021,"Retreat Grill, Bar and Restaurant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187053-d1877485-Reviews-Retreat_Grill_Bar_and_Restaurant-Bolton_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Bolton, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Not cheap but really good,"We don’t use this place very often but, when we do, we always enjoy it. They deliver the food which is convenient and that service has always been really good.

It isn’t the cheapest – for example, we had two duck spring rolls to start and it was £6.50! They were really good though to be fair and overall the food was good value for money.

We have two different curries and a noodle dish and the portions are huge. They were made spicy as requested and it won’t be as long before we use them again.

One last point. You don’t get any complimentary items like some other places such as prawn crackers or even a bottle of wine from one of their competitors.",April 2021,Jarern Street Foods,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187053-d17387441-Reviews-Jarern_Street_Foods-Bolton_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Bolton, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,5.0
"Very, very good indeed","We had never heard of this place before never mind used it. I’m so glad we have found it now as it has become our Indian takeaway of choice.

Ordering was easy and delivery quick and professional. Most importantly, the food was excellent. They offer a very wide range of standard dishes but also some interesting different ones as well.

The south Indian curry was as good as anything I’ve had from a takeaway and the other dishes were of a similar standard. It very much reminded me of a high class restaurant food rather than average stuff you get elsewhere.

Prices are fair, the quality great and big portions so definitely worth a try.",March 2021,Clay Cook Nation,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187053-d21375977-Reviews-Clay_Cook_Nation-Bolton_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Bolton, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Absolutely wonderful,"This is fantastic, authentic Cameroon takeaway is tucked away in the non-food section of Bolton market and should not be missed. It is a simple place but with fantastic, friendly service and amazing food. This was my first visit but it certainly won’t be my last as the quality was so good.

Don’t let the exterior put you off. I couldn’t see a menu board and the food in the glass fronted cabinet wasn’t easy to do identify. The helpful man who is a great character explained what things were and I sampled several of the dishes. The barbecued chicken was so succulent and tasty I’d love to know how they do it. We also had a goat stew which was fantastic, the chicken with lemon amazing and the ox cheek the same. All this served with jalof Rice and dumplings meant it was enough for two meals for two of us!

The cost is very reasonable and I cannot wait to revisit.

Highly recommended.",February 2021,Nkono,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187053-d7390217-Reviews-Nkono-Bolton_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Bolton, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,5.0
Still going strong,"Despite all the difficulties that seem to conspire against it, Bolton market is still a great place to visit. Get what you need from the supermarket and then get everything else from the market as it is cheap and great quality produce.

There is a massive variety of fruit and vegetables as well from all over the world.

During this difficult time it needs supporting. it is doing its very best and they are giving everyone free parking all day at the moment.

Consistently very good,"Every time we have a takeaway from here we have commented on just how good it is. Prompt and professional delivery service and authentic Thai food – what more can you asked for!

The portions aren’t the biggest but are delicious and still offer good value for money in my opinion. There is a great range in the menu and some things you don’t see very often.

Just beautiful,"This is a place we have visited countless times over the years but it never ceases to amaze. This latest visit was brilliant as we were there for two nights and saw complete contrasts.

Day one was when we did our walk and it was a freezing but sunny day which gave some amazing views. The next day the snows had come down and we got other fabulous views and took lots of terrific photos.

It can get busy at the weekends and in the summer so, if possible, Try and visit off peak to enjoy it to its fullest.",January 2021,Lake Windermere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186330-d2241602-Reviews-Lake_Windermere-Windermere_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Windermere, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
What a wonderful place!,"We had a wonderful one night stay at this beautiful hotel and can’t wait until we are allowed to return again. From the moment we arrived on the car park we felt at home and thoroughly enjoyed every element of our visit.

The grounds are beautiful and you can walk right down to the lakes edge. There aren’t any walks as such direct from the hotel but hundreds just a short car ride away so the location is brilliant.

The staff were superb . Not in the least bit stuffy but professional and welcoming. They explained everything to do with the virus clearly and we felt safe at all times.

Our room was very comfortable indeed and we slept very well . It was nice to have a bath after a long walk in the freezing temperatures and it made a big difference. Everything you need for a comfortable stay is in the room including a top-class coffee machine and bath robes. The beds were very comfortable indeed.

And the food! It was very difficult to choose from the menu even though it wasn’t massive. Everything sounded wonderful and that proved to be the case. It could have been a little bit warmer with the main courses but every dish and every course was top class.

All in all, a fantastic shortstay and we will be back as soon as we possibly can.",December 2020,Cragwood Country House Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186330-d584327-Reviews-Cragwood_Country_House_Hotel-Windermere_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Windermere, United Kingdom",hotels,5.0,5.0
Very enjoyable indeed,"As pub grub goes, this must be some of the best in the area. The setting in the cosy bar area with roaring fire is lovely for a start. They even have some tables outside but this was December and the weather certainly wasn’t suitable!

There is nothing complicated about the food, just good quality old-fashioned English cuisine. I had the turkey with all the trimmings and it was fantastic. Imaginative and tasty with really great produce I just about managed to finish it.

The steak and ale pie was also very good indeed and we both left feeling full and satisfied. We nearly treated ourselves to a dessert but just couldn’t have fitted it in.

All this supported by their homebrew beer makes it a great place for an evening out.",December 2020,Watermill Inn Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g3400212-d6387658-Reviews-Watermill_Inn_Restaurant-Ings_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Ings, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.5
Enjoyable stay,"It had been a few years since we last stayed here and we were very impressed on our most recent visit. There has been quite a bit of money spent on improving the car park, bar areas and so on and it really has improved.

The rooms have also been upgraded and are very comfortable indeed. After a day out walking in the fresh air we were shattered and slept really well in the very comfortable bed.

And the breakfast! I can’t ever remember having a better full English than this one. All local produce and I only wish we could get the same quality of items nearer to home.

All in all, a really enjoyable trip and when we will be making again soon.",December 2020,Watermill Inn & Windermere Brewing Co,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186326-d1152969-Reviews-Watermill_Inn_Windermere_Brewing_Co-Kendal_Lake_District_Cumbria_England.html,"Kendal, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Really enjoyed it,"We were struggling for an Indian takeaway so asked a friend for a recommendation. This was the first name he came up with and we weren’t disappointed.

Ordering was easy from just eat and the delivery arrived within one minute of the time specified! Food was of a very high class and it is a place we will be using regularly now.

The lamb on the bone had also been recommended by my friend and this was the best dish of the three.

Mixed experience,"This was our last meal before lockdown and ultimately we left disappointed. This is a regular place for us and we’ve had some great times over the years but the food let it down this time.

To get the negative out of the way first, the braised beef hash was really poor. £16 for a small portion of fairly fatty meat in a tinned tomato sauce was just not up to scratch. It was more like a stew than a hash and wasn’t very tasty at all. To be fair, the other dish of their gourmet Burger was really good indeed but was quite cold when we got the food.

On the plus side, we dined outside despite the cold weather and really enjoyed it. They have done a wonderful Job of this structure and we were warm and cosy throughout. The service too was excellent and the young lady who looked after us was professional, friendly and seem to really care about us having a good time.

I don’t think it offers value for money anymore on the food front any more. It cost us £50 for two main courses and two beers each – that doesn’t seem very reasonable at all. When we get chance, we will go back but only for drinks from now on.",November 2020,"Retreat Grill, Bar and Restaurant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187053-d1877485-Reviews-Retreat_Grill_Bar_and_Restaurant-Bolton_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Bolton, United Kingdom",restaurants,3.0,4.0
Excellent Last Supper!,"Although we didn’t know it at the time, this was to be our last meal before the second lockdown and it was a great place to enjoy it. The wonderful location in the countryside and the way this place handles itself is top class and we can’t wait to return.

They dealt with the restrictions better than anywhere else we have been to starting from when you park and walk to the front door where you can apply gel. You feel safe at all times that is for sure.

The food was exceptional. I had the ox cheek with cheddar mash and roasted beetroot which was amazing and the fish and chips was very good. It isn’t the cheapest place but I consider it good value as the quality is so high and certainly not your average pub grub.

I hope it isn’t too long before we can go back there as we had a wonderful evening in front of the roaring fire.",November 2020,The Yew Tree Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g8039151-d1647778-Reviews-The_Yew_Tree_Inn-Heath_Charnock_Chorley_Lancashire_England.html,"Heath Charnock, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Another excellent lockdown takeaway,"We knew the food from this place was great from when we dined in the restaurant but unfortunately this wasn’t an option now. We wanted a quality curry though and this place immediately sprung to mind. Thankfully, it didn’t let us down and we thoroughly enjoyed all of it.

It is easy to order off their own website and you have the option of either paying by card or the driver. It really is a slick system and the food was delivered in good time.

The South Indian jumbo prawn curry was excellent, the Bombay one not quite as good but still very good and the Kerelan chicken delicious. The portions were big enough that the meal lasted us two nights and we won’t hesitate to order from them again as and when we need to.

Our preferred option would be to be able to go back to the restaurant itself!",November 2020,Achari Bolton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187053-d1317206-Reviews-Achari_Bolton-Bolton_Greater_Manchester_England.html,"Bolton, United Kingdom",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Surprisingly Good,"This was my pretty much the last flight of the year from Crete back to Manchester and we weren’t looking forward to it. With the Covid numbers high being in a confined space didn’t appeal but it was a necessary evil. As it was, they did a really good job and we actually quite enjoyed it.

Checking in was easy and everything ran to time. Boarding was also easy and we were lucky enough to get a spare seat at the side of us which made a big difference.

The plane was comfortable, the staff made sure people adhered to the conditions and it passed quite quickly.

Mixed feelings,"This lovely bar was on our way into town so we decided to stop off for a drink. Overall, we really enjoyed the visit as you get excellent views of the sunset and you are right by the Venetian harbour wall – beautiful!

Unfortunately, you do pay for the privilege though. These were the most expensive drinks we had during our time in Crete and €10 for two beers did seem over the top. The service was very slow as well and we had to wait nearly 15 minutes to get them!

All that said, it was worth it in the end and we may have just caught them at a bad time. The beers were cold, the snacks provided free of charge were much appreciated and we would visit again.",October 2020,Sailing Club Sea Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189415-d16800798-Reviews-Sailing_Club_Sea_Lounge-Chania_Town_Chania_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Absolutely amazing!,"We looked long and hard for a special place to end our holiday and are so delighted we chose this particular restaurant. It is one of the most memorable meals we have ever had and I cannot speak highly enough of the place.

What seems to have been understated in the reviews I have read is the beauty and history of the building. There is a 14th century well in there along with some of the most beautiful architecture you can wish to see from the 1300s – quite amazing!

The food was fabulous as well. The kebabs delicious – lean meat delicately flavoured and served with some wonderful accompaniments. The aubergine meatballs were of a very high standard as well and all with a slight middle eastern feel to them. The portions were big and we had to get a takeaway which was no problem.

The service was excellent the house wine very drinkable and it isn’t an expensive place.

Lovely harbour Bar,"This beautiful harbourside bar has lots going for it. If you get chance whilst in town I highly recommend it as it is a lovely place to spend some time.

We used to go down there for sunset drinks and the views were amazing. It has a really relaxed atmosphere and the service is wonderful and friendly throughout.

Best of all, they serve the local beer from Crete and it is absolutely delicious. Having a couple of these whilst taking in the views of the Lighthouse and surroundings is a wonderful experience.

From place,"The heavens had opened and we were close by this lovely restaurant so dived in. It was on the street but covered by huge umbrellas so we managed to keep dry and have a nice time there.

The waiter was in the restaurant itself and the rain was so bad he had to use an umbrella to serve us! The seats were comfy, the music good and they brought us complimentary snacks which was appreciated.

Couldn’t really comment on the atmosphere as, because of the weather, we were the only people there!

Friendly place,"After weeks of beautiful sunshine the rain was lashing down and it was blowing a gale. We still found ourselves down at the harbour and looking for somewhere to grab a drink and take some shelter. This place did the job very well.

We were welcomed in warmly and our luck was in as it was happy hour. I’m not sure we needed cold beers in this weather but they went down well and we tried to dry out a little bit.

Lovely Evening,"We had lots of great meals whilst we were in Crete but not many as good as this. From start to finish we had a wonderful time and this is a truly excellent restaurant.

Set in the historic old town, the building oozes history and the restaurant is done out beautifully. You can dine out on the narrow street but, if you do, still make time to look at the inside of the place as it is stunning.

The food was wonderful as well! The lamb done with potatoes in the oven was top class and the same can be said for this sea bream. Classy, good size portions and not expensive.

Really excellent,"The first thing to say about this wonderful place is make a booking in advance. We were lucky that we did and we got in just about – we arrived a little bit early for our table and it was still full so it is very popular.

And you can see why! Not with standing the fact that the restaurant is absolutely beautiful in its own right the food was just delicious. I had the fillet of goat which was one of the most tender and tasty dishes of her entire holiday. Very little fat as well which was a surprise.

The lamb chops were delicious as well, cooked perfectly and very tasty indeed. The same can be said for the house wine which was one of the best we had.

I believe the name means something like cooking like mother and you do get that feeling from it. We didn’t get a menu but I just shown the dishes in the cabinet inside and chose from them.

The chicken with lemon was really good as was the stuffed tomatoes and peppers. The portions were huge and we took nearly half of what we bought away and had it the next day!

Wonderful Place,"Our initial booking in the Bio Suites was for two nights but we kept extending it as we didn't want to leave! In the end, we loved the place so much we stayed for 12 nights and it was amazing.

The moment you walk in you sense this is a well run hotel that feels very comfortable indeed. The level of customer service we received was quite unmatched anywhere else in our holiday and we loved our time there.

Location – very good indeed.

It is one block back from the beach and a lovely 10 minutes stroll along the seafront into the old town. It is surrounded by bars, shops and restaurants so you can get everything you need within one minutes walk.

Rooms – we took a one bedroom apartment which was very comfortable indeed.

It has a little kitchenette in it which provides everything you need if you wanted to dine in but we used the restaurants in town. The bed was very comfortable and we slept soundly every single night. We got no noise from the street or other guests and the air-conditioning was very effective.

As you would expect for a place of this quality, you have everything you need for a comfortable stay. The bathroom had an excellent shower and the balcony was big with great furniture on it and we spent hours on there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.

Food – the breakfast buffet worked really well in these unusual times and they served you quickly and efficiently.

There was an excellent array of high quality food both hot and cold. The juice and coffee were okay and the service excellent.

Wi-Fi – good and strong in all areas of the hotel and pool.

Free for unlimited devices and none of that annoying having to login frequently.

Pool area – excellent.

A beautiful area especially when it is lit up at night. Lots of sun loungers, daybeds and sun or shade depending on your requirements. No bed reservation here which is a nice change!

Staff – absolutely superb.

This is obviously a very well-managed place as all the staff were genuinely helpful and seemed very engaged in the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they genuinely cared whether you had a good time. Cannot speak highly enough about them.",October 2020,Bio Suites Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189421-d278941-Reviews-Bio_Suites_Hotel-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",hotels,5.0,4.5
Great From Start to Finish,"This is an excellent and reliable Company.

Our journey was from Rethymno to Chania and went very smoothly. Communication was excellent and the price very fair.

The driver was prompt, polite and friendly and we felt safe at all times.",October 2020,Rethymno Taxi.com,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189421-d12659751-Reviews-Rethymno_Taxi_com-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
Absolutely wonderful!,"We had wandered past this restaurant a few times during our stay in town and wish we’d made the decision to go in earlier. It was one of the best meals we had during seven weeks on Crete and it’s difficult to describe how good the food was.

The dish that had attracted us was the lamb with figs and garlic. It was amazing! A big portion of tender lamb in a rich gravy and bursting with flavour. Our other dish of home-made moussaka was cooked fresh and again was excellent. We got nowhere near finishing either dish and a takeaway was gladly prepared for us.

The setting is amazing on the ancient cobbled streets with gentle music playing in the background. The service was fun, friendly and professional and I highly recommend this restaurant.",October 2020,Elia Traditional Cretan Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g7364931-d3431299-Reviews-Elia_Traditional_Cretan_Taverna-Sellia_Plakias_Agios_Vasileios_Municipality_Reth.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Good fun,"This little bar was close by our hotel and we enjoyed our visits there. It is right on the main road looking out on onto the sea and Oldtown beyond. The music really wasn’t to our taste but the atmosphere was great and the service very friendly.

Best of all, the beer was really cold in the baking sun and went down very well indeed. Complimentary snacks are brought and are much appreciated so this is a place definitely worth a visit.",October 2020,Cactus Beach Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189421-d10179522-Reviews-Cactus_Beach_Bar-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Excellent evening,"This seafront restaurant was close to our hotel so we decided to give it a go. We were not disappointed and had a wonderful evening there.

The welcome was warm and we were shown to our seats and brought a delicious orange raki drink free of charge. the atmosphere was warm and friendly and the service is impeccable throughout.

The food was good as well! The moussaka was very good and the gyros absolutely excellent. Both portions were plentiful and very tasty indeed.

Complimentary desserts and two flasks of raki were then brought which was very generous but we certainly didn’t drink it all! All in all, a lovely evening.",October 2020,Nostos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189421-d17474533-Reviews-Nostos-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,5.0
What a gem!,"We found this place whilst exploring the backstreets and had a lovely evening there. It is a truly authentic Greek family restaurant and definitely deserves a visit.

It is it down to earth place serving quite a short menu which I always find reassuring. The lamb with lemon was exquisite exquisite and the Greek style spinach and porkpie delicious. the portions are quite large and the service is low-key but efficient and friendly enough; the house wine is very drinkable.

Overall, you will struggle to find a restaurant with a more home-cooked and family feeling to it in town.",October 2020,Nyn & Aei,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189421-d1515473-Reviews-Nyn_Aei-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Interesting landmark,"As you would expect from a lighthouse, you can’t miss this building! It stands proud of the entrance to the harbour and is a reference point for the town.

Avoid the harbour restaurants in the evening as you will get pestered beyond belief and best to visit the Lighthouse during the day. You can walk right out to it and it is a beautiful, historic building.

You will also get to take in wonderful views of the sea and mountains beyond.",October 2020,Rethymno Lighthouse,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189421-d17577346-Reviews-Rethymno_Lighthouse-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.0
Very classy indeed,"We tried many restaurants in this area and this one was head and shoulders above most of them. It feels classy without being pompous and we had a lovely evening there.

The menu is innovative and has some delicious alternatives to the standard dishes. I have tried several seafood risottos is on Crete but this one was head and this one was easily the best of them. Packed full of delicious fresh seafood and cooked perfectly. I’m sure that, whatever you choose to have here, it would be excellent.

The setting is beautiful in a picturesque historic street and atmosphere laid-back and relaxed. The house wine is very very drinkable and the service wonderful throughout.

We had a lovely evening and I would highly recommend this place.",October 2020,Kapilio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189421-d1102992-Reviews-Kapilio-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Thought it would be better,"We had a nice evening at this restaurant but there were a few niggles along the way. Overall, we enjoyed our time there but won’t be returning.

There is no doubt the setting is beautiful. Set on a narrow street with beautiful buildings it is lovely but it does mean you dine very close to pedestrians passing by. We were brought bottle of water we didn’t ask for so sent it away and some pretty poor appetisers. Again, these weren’t asked for and consisted of four olives, a spoonful of weak tomato purée and a couple of bits of bread. It was disappointing that we were charged for these at the end of the meal.

The restaurant price itself on being creative Cretan cuisine and you can’t argue with that. The food is innovative and dishes you don’t see anywhere else. I had a stifado which was done in pastry and, unfortunately, it didn’t really work. The other dish of belly pork was pretty good though. Big portions and not expensive.

Complimentary desserts were brought which were absolutely excellent and were the highlight of the meal. The orange pie was absolutely delicious and much appreciated. The service throughout was professional, courteous and very friendly.",October 2020,Rakodikio,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189421-d9565467-Reviews-Rakodikio-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,3.0,4.5
Absolutely excellent,"Last year when we were in town this restaurant had provided the best meal we had on Crete. As a result of this, we were determined to go back as soon as we could and we weren’t let down. Again it was simply fabulous.

The staff are very professional and observed all necessary measures during this unusual time. They were happy to make recommendations from the menu and the lamb with olive oil and whiteWine was simply stunning. Absolutely delicious with lots of tender meat. The moussaka was of a very high quality and the portions more than enough for us.

The house wine is really good and the complimentary digestive and grapes were much appreciated. If you get chance you can’t go wrong with a visit to this excellent place.",October 2020,Raki Ba Raki 1600,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189421-d4466527-Reviews-Raki_Ba_Raki_1600-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Sunset drinks,"This was a regular place for us to visit during our time in town. We liked the look of the menu for food more in other places but it was always great to have a couple of sunset beers.

These were priced it only €3 during happy hour and were really cold. We took seats at the front and got fantastic views over the harbour and the mountains beyond. Very beautiful indeed.

The service was really friendly and they have free Wi-Fi that is pretty good.",October 2020,Tassos Restaurant Taverna,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189421-d3417349-Reviews-Tassos_Restaurant_Taverna-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Lovely location,"This is a classy place set out by the harbour. This was the opposite side of town from us but we still used to make the effort to go there as it is a beautiful change of scenery.

The views from the restaurants are quite stunning over the port and the Craggy coastline. You can also see the Venetian wall which is very beautiful.

The beer was cold and we really enjoyed our time there.",October 2020,Fanari,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189421-d1102991-Reviews-Fanari-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Great beach club,"This café was very close to our hotel and serves a wide range of food and drinks. It seemed very popular with the locals which I always think is a good sign.

Predominantly, we used it as a beach club though. It cost €8 for two very comfortable sun loungers with a big effective parasol – not all places have these!

Drinks are served from the café to the beach and, although the music wasn’t to my taste, it’s still made for a very comfortable place to spend the day.",October 2020,Noble,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189421-d20238112-Reviews-Noble-Rethymnon_Rethymnon_Prefecture_Crete.html,"Crete, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
