Service and resort impeccable - we can’t wait to return,We went here with a baby and a disabled person and it could not have been more pleasant.

Great hotel,This hotel was super clean and tidy and the room had all the amenities needed and was a great size. We got a canal view room and it was so nice opening up the windows in the morning.

Always great Mexican here,"This restaurant knows how to do Mexican food great and cheap. I always bring people here for a cheaper meal and no one is disappointed.

Favourite park,This park is a must if you like all the swans. There always seems to be more bird life and squirrels here than at Hyde park. There isn't a lot of facilities but just enough to to be able to relax on the grass with a cold drink.,July 2016,St. James's Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d188126-Reviews-St_James_s_Park-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,5.0,4.5
Always worth a visit,I did this when I first came to London and went on the tour around the tower. Now we always send people there for the day when we are at work.

Good bar but bit pretenscious,This is one of those bars that doesn't have a sign out front so you have to be in the know to enter it. They had a good cocktail and whiskey selection and the service was generally good but nothing really stood out.,July 2016,Milk And Honey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d5220158-Reviews-Milk_And_Honey-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Nice pool but fairly average hotel,"This hotel is right at the start of the hotel strip, and like the others has a pool that leads out onto the beach. The pool staff are lovely without you feeling like they are there all the time. The concierge and tour desk are only there to sell you their expensive products. For example I asked the to book an airport shuttle for me but they refused and would only book me a transfer in their expensive cars. The food is not great and the room service so bad I had to send it back. I ordered an eye fillit with a medley of grilled vegetables and got roadkill with fries. However there are lovely places to eat along the strip and this hotel does have some very cheap specials so maybe you get what you pay for. The hotel does need a bit of work done so done expect brand new rooms and there is a bit of mould growing in the corridors.",June 2016,"The Westin Resort & Spa, Cancun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150807-d152889-Reviews-The_Westin_Resort_Spa_Cancun-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html,"Cancun, Mexico",hotels,3.0,4.0
Huge portion sizes,This is a really great place to eat with friends or family. Its quite cheap for the amount of food that you get and the service is fast and pleasant. As always the ribs were the favourite but the Mexican food and cocktails went down a treat as well. Its not too near any tube stop but then its good to walk off some of the food after!,July 2015,Big Easy - Chelsea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d807123-Reviews-Big_Easy_Chelsea-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,4.0,4.0
Great food here as well,This is place is great to go if you have a few hours esp in winter as it is all indoors. They also have a nice food court and the food is better here than in any other museum that I have been to. They always have some new exhibition on as well - at the moment there is a machine that has built the most amazing outdoor structure.,June 2016,V&A - Victoria and Albert Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d187556-Reviews-V_A_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",attractions,4.0,4.5

Service is poor,We went here on a weekday and the service was atrocious. The waitstaff were very rude and in the end we left after having waited over half an hour for our food. When I pointed this out to our waiter he blamed the kitchen and said it would be another half hour. Didn't give me any other options so we decided to try somewhere else.,October 2015,L'ETO CAFFE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d7283366-Reviews-L_ETO_CAFFE-London_England.html,"London, United Kingdom",restaurants,2.0,4.0

Amataurish,I wouldn't stop here for too long. one you have to pay to see something which you can see from the bus secondly it is that great.
