To busy,"It was overcrowded. I've never seen so many people on this kind of attraction.

Special thanks to lady Mia, she is some kind of ""police"" over there. I can tell you she ruin my visit that day with her very rude behavior. I don't have clue how someone like that cloud work with tourists. Authority should have evaluation of her job.",August 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
