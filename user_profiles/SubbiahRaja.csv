I was mesmerized,Can spend a week going around this place and understanding every aspect of it. Had only a few hours though. Made good use of it by taking the services of Ahtens Walking Tours.,February 2020,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
One of the best Museums I have ever visited,Breath taking. The design and the way it is organized ! The top floor is designed to replicate the Parthenon and it is a great way to take you back in history.,February 2020,Acropolis Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d735521-Reviews-Acropolis_Museum-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
Really enjoyed the food and service,Looks like they had opened the place recently. The team was very helpful. The menu was both in English and Greek. Enjoyed their Mushroom Pie with Carrot & Beet juice. Very cozy and well designed place.,February 2020,Mother Vegan Cafe Bistro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189400-d20141471-Reviews-Mother_Vegan_Cafe_Bistro-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Very good hotel with friendly staff,"Traveled for business and stayed here for 5 nights. I had booked through Hotels.com. The checkin was seamless. The instructions that the front desk provided where very clear and informative. Central Athens is about 15 minutes walk from the place. Restaurants and shops are at a walking distance. Since it is on a important road, getting taxis was never difficult. The nearest metro is Sigrou Fix which is about 800 meters.",February 2020,Ilissos Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d553369-Reviews-Ilissos_Hotel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,4.0,3.5
