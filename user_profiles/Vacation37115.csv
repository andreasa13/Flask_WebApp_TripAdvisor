"""Wow"" feeling","The elevator brought us to the 4th floor, where the restaurant is. The interior is very beautifull and, as it was nice weather, we were invited to sit outside at one of the tables on the big terrace. From there, we had a stunning view of the surroundings (the palace on on one side and the garden on the other side). This first impression gave us already a ""WOW"" feeling. Staff is very professional and friendly. We chose the 7 course menu which might be a little bit to much for a lunch, but we wanted to taste the different courses in order to enjoy the Piemopnt kitchen to the fullest. We were not disappointed! Each course was very tastfull and showed us how good the Piemont kitchen in fact is. We had the pleasure to talk with the chef Alfredo Russo and that gave an extra touch to the ""wow"" feeling. So, all in all very worthwhile to visit despite the fact that is not located in Torino, but some 10 km oustide (Palace of Venaria is also worthwhile to visit!)",September 2020,Dolce Stil Novo Alla Reggia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1055367-d1091700-Reviews-Dolce_Stil_Novo_Alla_Reggia-Venaria_Reale_Province_of_Turin_Piedmont.html,"Venaria Reale, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Best in center of Torino,"Probably the best restaurant in the center of Torino. Staff is professional & friendly. Atmosphere is interesting and unique. We had the Festival menu (75 euro) and all the dishes were excellent and showed a very good display of the international kitchen, like the Katsu. We had a sparkling wine as an aperitif and two glasses of wine during the dinner, which were good suggestions by the sommelier. All in all, we believe this is one of the best 1 Michelin star restaurants we visited so far in Europe.",September 2020,Condividere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187855-d14210288-Reviews-Condividere-Turin_Province_of_Turin_Piedmont.html,"Turin, Italy",restaurants,5.0,4.5
worthwhile to visit,"When visiting Torino, THIS is the museum to visit as it gives a very good impression of the history of this city.

A real gem,"This is a perfect place to spent a night when you are in Dijon. The location is perfect and we could easily park our car in the public garage one block away.
