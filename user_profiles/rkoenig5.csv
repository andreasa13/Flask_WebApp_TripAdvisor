We were treated like family.,"Beautiful, peaceful & safe. We would absolutely stay here again.
From the moment we stepped into the courtyard, we knew, we had a winner. Wonderful views of the Aegean sea with beautiful landscaping. The pool was crystal clear with plenty of outdoor seating. The rooms are large, clean and quiet.
However, this does not compare to the outstanding service we received.
Ercan,(American spelling) is so kind and friendly. He was more than happy to help in any way possible.
There is only one way to describe Sevi. She is the best hostess we have ever had. Her cooking is awesome and she made us feel like we were the only one's there :).
One of the cat's (that we lovingly named Oskar) came to visit us everyday, at dinner.
We absolutely enjoyed Oskar's company and sweet disposition.
Thank you, for making our stay so special.",September 2019,Aegean Gate Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298658-d643023-Reviews-Aegean_Gate_Hotel-Bodrum_City_Bodrum_District_Mugla_Province_Turkish_Aegean_Coast.html,"Bodrum City, Turkey",hotels,5.0,5.0
Very crowded.,"We went at the end of September 2019 and it was very crowded.
Dealing with the mobs of tourist made it very difficult to get around. Take a guided tour or download a free audio guide off line.",September 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Very good,Very modern and clean. Take a guided tour. There is a coffee/restaurant with a nice patio deck outside.

Very Nice Hotel,"Friendly & professional staff. The hotel is new, has a modern design with accents of ancient Greece. Very close to train station & approximately a 30 minute walk to the acropolis.
We eat at the hotel restaurant 3 times and enjoyed every meal. We like to support local businesses when traveling & was able to find grocery stores, bakeries & neighborhood restaurants.
Special thanks to front desk clerk, Yiannis. His professionalism with difficult customers was a true credit character. He was very personable and always willing help us.",September 2019,ibis Styles Athens Routes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189400-d17638948-Reviews-Ibis_Styles_Athens_Routes-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",hotels,5.0,5.0
BED BUGS....,"When we first walked into the room, we noticed all the drawers were open and chair cushion was standing straight up. Strange but never gave it a 2nd thought.
On day 2, we were gone for most of the day & returned to a room that had not been cleaned. After calling the front desk, we got clean towels & soap for the next morning.
The following morning we checked out & within hours after leaving, I started to develop a rash with blisters and itching. Looked up my symptoms online and compare pictures to what I have. It definitely looks like BED BUGS.... Looking back, the staff most likely sprayed for bugs, but did not give the room a deep cleaning.
At this time, I can not recommend this hotel.",June 2017,Hilton Garden Inn Austin Northwest / Arboretum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g30196-d252820-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Austin_Northwest_Arboretum-Austin_Texas.html,"Austin, Texas",hotels,2.0,4.0
We had to request the manager.,"We went to Los Arcos, locate at 249 & Spring Cypress Rd. Tomball Texas. The hostess sat us across from the kitchen, even though there were plenty of other tables available. We order taco's, 1 chicken and 1 beef. The chicken taco's were cold & was sent back to the kitchen. After waiting for approximately 10 minutes, the second order came out cold again. The beef taco's had little to no seasoning & extremely bland. The service was fair to good, but could have tried a little harder. This area is full of Mexican restaurants and most likely will never eat here again.",October 2016,Los Arcos Mexican Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g56780-d4127717-Reviews-Los_Arcos_Mexican_Restaurant-Tomball_Texas.html,"Tomball, Texas",restaurants,1.0,3.5
