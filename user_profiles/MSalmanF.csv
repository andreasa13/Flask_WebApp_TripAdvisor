Comfortable property,It's comfortable property in the middle of the city which is convenient. At the same time during the day neighborhood is very crowded and noisy. Rooms are comfortable and good size. It's an old guest house of old ex ruler of Gilgit. It's a small property but has beautiful lawns and gardens. Due to Covid we had to eat in the veranda at night and in the lawn but they provided fire place next to the table. During our afternoon tea service was super slow and waiter was kind of rude. I had to remind him that we are guest. After that service improved. Food was average for dinner and very limited choice for breakfast buffet and not very good either. Since there is very limited choice of nice hotels there so we would go back even though it's not the best.,December 2020,Swat Serena Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608517-d304435-Reviews-Swat_Serena_Hotel-Saidu_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa_Province.html,"Saidu, Pakistan",hotels,3.0,4.0
Group,It’s conveniently located on highway but very far from Balakot. Rooms are very spacious and comfortable. It has good size lawn and lot of parking. Even though it has Inventor AC but manger wouldn’t turn it on. We had four rooms but he only turn on only one and when we asked to turn on others he asked us to turn off first one. After lot of Hassling manager turned on three. When we needed the most at night manger turned them off. Also they didn’t have chef so restaurant was closed. We had to go out for dinner in very cold. And we had to leave without breakfast. I wouldn’t recommend. It seems Managment is cheap.,November 2020,Hotel Demanchi,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g4366523-d13996402-Reviews-Hotel_Demanchi-Abbottabad_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa_Province.html,"Abbottabad, Pakistan",hotels,2.0,2.5
Group Tour,Property is located on the lake. Beautiful view from the rooms. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Bathrooms have always hot water. Property is still under construction so you have to be careful waking around. Restaurant seems not ready to serve. Breakfast had very limited selection. Food prices are over price. Also rooms are way over price. On top of all it seems management is professionally unethical. We had paid in advance for several rooms. Collegue of two rooms had to leave early for one night. We requested the Management to refund if those rooms get occupied. They agreed and the rooms did get occupied. When we requested the refund they refused. We tried to contact for several days but they kept refusing and finally quit taking our calls. Doesn’t matter how great a property I will never stay at such place or recommend anyone.,August 2020,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g469409-d17795067-Reviews-Luxus_Hunza_Attabad_Lake_Resort-Hunza_Gilgit_Baltistan.html,"Hunza, Pakistan",hotels,2.0,3.0
We have heard about it and,"We have heard about it and it’s walnut cake. We walked 15 minutes to get there. It was nothing but disappointing experience. To start with people taking orders were not friendly at all. When we mentioned we heard about ur place, they didn’t even bother to smile or acknowledge. We only ordered cake and tea. It took a such a long time that I had to go and remind them. And the cake was dry, also nothing special about it. Then wooden stairs were slanted. My wife almost slipped couple of times.

Family House,It’s family house and they converted three rooms for guests. Rooms are clean and airy. It’s very close to Adam’s Peak. Entrance Thanks is dangerously steep. I had to beg them to give half an hour more for check out 12:00 which is norm most of the places. At check in they didn’t believe I had the reservation since I turn out to be Asian not Caucasian because I am US citizen.,March 2020,Daffodils Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608524-d6936494-Reviews-Daffodils_Hotel-Nuwara_Eliya_Central_Province.html,"Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka",hotels,3.0,3.5
Nothing like this place,For Muslims it is the place to visit. Some people save all their life to visit. It’s a incredible place. Very peaceful and harmonious. At the same time it’s modern and spacious. You could spend hours here. At the same time markets and washrooms are right outside the gate. Every time we visit we don’t want to leave and love to keep coming back.

Some staffs Discriminate,"It’s a beautiful property with a very good location. Lobby is huge. Breakfast buffet has good verity. Staff at breakfast was very attentive. Unfortunately staff at executive lounge needs to be educated how to treat all guest equally. At check in lady was very rude even though we are Diamond members. Also she didn’t bother to explain anything about the facilities at this property. At the same time at checkout when I came to executice lounge there was another lady who was putting glasses on snack area. I informed her I wanted to check out. Then as usual I asked her how she is doing, she abruptly responded I should go to front desk for checkout.

At the same time there was no customer service. We were there for five nights and they didn’t change our sheets for four days. Finally we had ask for it.

Best Free Walking Tour,"My wife, my daughter and I had one of the best tour in our life. Eleni was extremely knowledgeable with enthusiasm. When we asked any question she was willing to listen and respond. She was always ready and willing to help. We had our special daughter with us. Due to her we had to slowed down a lot but she didn’t complain. Most of the time she had to slow down and kept all of us together. At the same time she didn’t push her. We were able to see some hidden places, out of main path. Then she gave us extra information where to go and eat. We enjoyed greatly.

Not up to par with Hilton name,Location is very good. Breakfast buffet is good. Since there are so many Muslim travelers I wish there are Halal choices at breakfast.

Iran: MUST SEE COUNTRY,"Even though it took Iranian embassy four month to grant me visa and that was only for eight days. It was worth traveling. After visiting Iran I visited three more countries and I have been recommending Iran highly. Don’t listen to Fox and CNN. Totally safe. People are wondering around streets middle of the night. Never seen more clean country in my life and I have seen a lot of countries. History and culture are unmatchable. Love to go back again and again. Guide, Shahram was with me most of the time. Extremely knowledgeable and accommodating. What I like about him that he also gave me some private time which I utilized it to my fullest by renting a bike which he helped. Biked till 10:00 pm and started again 6:00 AM in Isfahan. Amazing city.

Great way to see the country side,"I took GABALA & SHAMAKHI tour. Guide name was Gulshan, I believe. She was very good and seasoned guide. She was very professional and accommodating. Old mosque and suspended bridge were worth seeing. Highlight was homemade lunch which was very good but on expensive side. At the same time you expect that from homemade one in the middle of no where. Environment was great. Best part of the trip was ski resort, Tufandag Mountain Resort. Scene from the top was breathtaking. Only short coming was, we didn’t have enough time to enjoy more of this place. Overall it was excellent trip and had a very good day.

It was beautiful day to visit lakes and beautiful landscape. Our tour guide Arman was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. He was able to response most of the questions with a smile. He was very accommodating. Lunch was BBQ fish with lot of extra items and very good at a very reasonable price. Only suggestion, tourist should introduce each other start of the tour to break the ice. Introduction was never done. It will make the tour even more enjoyable.

Especially Jamal at guest services went out of way to assist me when I was trying to find a bike to rent. Also I was trying to take local tour and had some issues he helped me. Then he recommended an out of town tour which I took and it was wonderful. Got to see country side too. Breakfast also had good selection. Some staff even called me by my name.

Great museum with incredible live performance,It was one of the best surprise of six days tour of Iran. Didn’t expect to have such a great collection of traditional music of Iran and around the region. Another surprise was how so many instruments were common with Pakistan and subcontinent. Guide was so enthusiastic that it seems like it was first time which obviously wasn’t not. It shows how much he loves his job and showing off his collections. Best part was surprise live performance by its own staff who were best at what they were performing. Twenty- thirty minutes passed by so fast. I suggested them to visit Pakistan to perform. Love to come back on my next visit.

Most unfriendly staff,Marhaba Lounge at Dubai airport at Terminal 3 has overall most unfriendly staff I ever encountered in my over forty years of traveling. This didn’t happened once but every time we used their lounge which is many many times. Matter of fact we were at this airport twice in last three weeks and we had the time to go their but as a family we decided not to try again. Despite the fact beside being member we still had to pay to use it. They gave the impression they are doing you favor. Start from reception to the management has the same attitude. Last time manager was standing close to the reception and giving very rude and uncomfortable looks to guests. We will make sure never to use them and let everyone knows not to use them.,April 2019,marhaba Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d4345666-Reviews-Marhaba_Lounge-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,1.0,3.0
Not close to the airport,This property is named Dubai airport to give the impression that it’s near the airport. Instead its around 12 KM away. There are many other hotels which are much closer to airport. It’s a very basic hotel. There customer service/house keeping is minimum. We tried to call for something over the phone several times. Finally had to go to the corridor to catch someone from cleaning staff and he wasn’t very friendly either.,June 2019,Hampton by Hilton Dubai Airport,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d14053402-Reviews-Hampton_by_Hilton_Dubai_Airport-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,3.0,4.5
Very serene resort,Even though property is around seven hours drive from Colombo but it's worth the trip. It's very serene property. Each Villa is private with it's own mini pool. Bedroom and living room are beautifully decorated with all the modern amenities and comfort. Washroom is beautiful and very spacious. Whole Vila has glass windows around it so you could enjoy the nature while sitting inside. The property is consist of 55 Acres. It has several activities for the family including children and adults. Next door is very large beautiful lake. It's swimming pool is very large. Meals are very good but doesn't have the variety of tropical fruits we expected. Staff was very courteous and friendly. Each Villa is provided with two adult bikes and one child bike. Since I am a biker I made the most out of bikes by riding two days we stayed thirty to forty KM each day. My whole family truly enjoyed it and hated to leave. Only suggestion: bikes are rusty and filthy. They need to be cleaned and maintained. Also property charges twice to foreigners then to locals which is not justifiable.,April 2019,Ulagalla by Uga Escapes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g2335977-d1876504-Reviews-Ulagalla_by_Uga_Escapes-Thirappane_North_Central_Province.html,"Thirappane, Sri Lanka",hotels,5.0,5.0

Hunza Valley is surrounded by many over twenty thousand feet peaks. You could twist your neck just by looking at them. We also visited Attabad Lake and Pusso village on Karakoram Highway.

Interior is also done with very good taste keeping the tradition of Gilgit. Rooms were very spacious and very comfortable beds. Dinner and breakfast had very good selection.

Worst airline,Airline cancelled my flight by giving poor excuse of strike in Paris when all the other airline was flying and I saw their counter open when I was checking in on another airline which I had to pay three times more. Email I received from them asked me to cancel and get refund but there was no way I could cancel and get refund on their site. I tried to call several time but continuously busy. Then I called Expedia where I bought my ticket. They also tried for half an hour to contact them but failed.

Rip off airline,Since I bought ticket one day earlier it was at least 20 times more expensive then average fare cost. That’s a rip off. Also what I understood was one luggage was included on their site since it stated extra bag will be charged. One check in bag fee was twice the price of average fare. For a national carrier plane was super vanilla.

Most amazing Museum,I have been seeing pictures of these soldiers all my life. Seeing them first time was breath taking. How rich Chinese civilization was and is. It's just amazing how over two thousand years craftsmen worked all their lives to make these soldier. Words can't describe it. Anyone visiting China must take the time to visit this museum.,July 2018,The Museum of Qin Terra-cotta Warriors and Horses,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298557-d321017-Reviews-The_Museum_of_Qin_Terra_cotta_Warriors_and_Horses-Xi_an_Shaanxi.html,"Xi'an, China",attractions,5.0,4.5
Average hotel with strange decor,During our stay in China for ten days and staying in four hotels this was not very good. It had strange decor with not matching color schemes. Room was small and so was bathroom and shower. Breakfast buffet didn't have good selection. Even though we were group of almost 100 Muslim visitors they still didn't arrange Halal food. Service wasn't very good either. Lobby area was very very small. Over all not a good experience.,September 2018,Guilin Bravo Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298556-d304888-Reviews-Guilin_Bravo_Hotel-Guilin_Guangxi.html,"Guilin, China",hotels,2.0,4.0
Just breath taking,Guilin Forest is another beautiful symbol of China. This forest is one of a kind. You have to visit it when you visit China. Boat ride we took was like watching a real life movie.,July 2018,Guangxi Guilin Forest Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298556-d1856202-Reviews-Guangxi_Guilin_Forest_Park-Guilin_Guangxi.html,"Guilin, China",attractions,5.0,4.5
Beautiful Lobby but still average hotel,This property has beautiful and very huge open lobby. But rooms were very small. Breakfast area was also not so big and they have closed part of it for their members. Selection of food was ok too. One of the staff at front desk was not very friendly at all. Others staff members were ok.,July 2018,Holiday Inn Express Beijing Temple Of Heaven,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294212-d1145964-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_Beijing_Temple_Of_Heaven-Beijing.html,"Beijing, China",hotels,3.0,4.5
Great property with great location,As always Conrad Dubai by Hilton is one of the best property we stayed. It has best location. Metro station is at it's front door. Also it close to everything in Dubai even airport is 10 minutes drive. It's a beautiful property with gorgeous decor. Staff is super friendly. Breakfast buffet has great selection. Executive lounge staff is extremely helpful. It's swimming pool is great. My daughter loved it. My wife used it's spa and massage and loved it too. Great place to stay. Will love to stay again..,August 2018,Conrad Dubai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d1456254-Reviews-Conrad_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",hotels,5.0,4.5
Must see in Beijing,Forbidden city is historical land mark of China that must be visited if you visit Beijing. What I read about it and being there first hand is amazing. Just imagining that commoner were not allowed. As for as it's architecture beauty it's not what I imagined because Mughals and Moores Architecture is much grandeur that this. At the same time it's still worth seeing.,July 2018,Forbidden City-The Palace Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294212-d319086-Reviews-Forbidden_City_The_Palace_Museum-Beijing.html,"Beijing, China",attractions,4.0,4.5
Worse customer service,"PriorityPass membership # 1439138681

Just came to Marhaba Lounge Concorde B, Terminal 3, Dubai Intetnational Airport. Lady at the reception tried her best to discourage us to come in. She kept insisting lounge is full. She asked for my flight time and she informed me all the passengers are on the same flight which was impossible. When my wife went to check the availability there were at least 40 % empty. I was amazed by this kind of unfriendly reception despite the fact we are paying for each visit.. Will not renew the membership if we keep getting such reception.",August 2018,marhaba Lounge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d4345666-Reviews-Marhaba_Lounge-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",restaurants,1.0,3.0
Excellent but very crowded,"Musical fountains are must see in Dubai. Every times we came, it had different music.This time it was Pakistan’s Independence Day. After the music Pakistani flag was lit up on Burj Khalifa, tallest building in the word. It was just beautiful. Only thing is during the performance it is very very crowded.

Getting rusty Resort,"This property does have several swimming pools. Breakfast buffet has good selection. It is right next to the beach. Otherwise it was a very disappointing visit. To begin with, check in took more then 1/2 hour even though we arrived around 3:00 pm. Staff at check in didn’t guide us what’s available on the property or any activities. We had two rooms. One of the room key wouldn’t start AC and lights. It took several calls, personal visit to the front desk before it got resolved. In the morning there was no water in the shower. Again it took several calls and personal visit to front desk before it got resolved. Next morning while in the shower there was no hot water even though I waited 10 minutes. Finally I took shower with cold water. At the beach there were dozens and dozens hawkers trying to sell you sports activities. You just can’t enjoy the beach. Rooms were old and rusty. This is probably one of the worst resort I stayed. Never come back or recommend any one.",July 2018,"Shangri-La Golden Sands, Penang",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g635527-d302164-Reviews-Shangri_La_Golden_Sands_Penang-Batu_Ferringhi_Penang_Island_Penang.html,"Penang Island, Malaysia",hotels,2.0,4.0
Great location next to a Mall,Location is one the best. Next door Mall with variety of restaurants including Halal. Also has Metro on its foot steps that take you anywhere. Got upgraded to a better room with great view. Room was very comfortable. Room service was good too. Overall staff was helpful accept some of the staff at concierge. It seems they were always in hurry and not very courteous which not likely in Japan. One person at concierge even gave me direction and didn’t guide me to the laundry shop to pick up my clothes. Same morning we had to catch a train. Due to him I got late.. breakfast had good selection but no selection for Halal. Overall it was good experience.,July 2018,Hilton Tokyo Odaiba,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g14134368-d302399-Reviews-Hilton_Tokyo_Odaiba-Daiba_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Daiba, Japan",hotels,4.0,4.5
Great place to stay,"Location is the best, above Kyoto Railway Central Station. Same locations has malls, shopping centers and huge underground shopping center with food court. Due to centrally located you can get all sort of mode transportation available including tourist buses too. Staff as you expect in Japan is super friendly and humble. Response for room service was very good. Without t asking we got room upgrade. Breakfast has good selection but being Muslim it’s hard to find Halal food. Even though hotel had some Halal items on their main menu. Again very unusual. Room had a good view. Room size and bathroom size was surprisingly spacious in contrast to most of the Japanese hotels. Staff at concierge were one of the most helpful.

Beautiful hotel,"Even though it’s a beautiful property but it’s next to dirty sidewalk of river Nile. Just to cross the street is putting your life at risk, there is so much traffic. Even though I got upgrade to suite facing the Nile but staff wasn’t very friendly since I am not a Caucasian. Quite frankly they looked down at me till they find out I am Diamond member. At check out I was running late to catch my flight, I tried several times to get attention of staff to help with my luggage but failed. Even though he was looking straight at me. Finally I had to carry my own luggage to taxi.. Doesn’t matter how beautiful property is if staff isn’t friendly you just don’t enjoy your stay..",March 2018,Conrad Cairo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302720-Reviews-Conrad_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Cairo, Egypt",hotels,3.0,4.5

Great hike & sunrise,Hike is hard but good if you are a hiker which I am. Even though we arrived at the base around 11:30 pm but didn’t start till 1:30 am. Then hike shouldn’t take more then 2 - 2.30 hours but it took us four hours. One reason I can understand to keep everyone together but no reason to stop every 15 min & at every coffee shop. Our body was getting hot and cold. Also local guide and coffee shops owners are relatives. Guide wanted to make sure we give some business to them. Then guide disappeared before the top so we were on our own at the top. Sunrise was incredible and morning scenery was just beautiful as the sun came up we got to see what we missed during night hike even though it was full moon. That made it easier to hike. We didn’t have to use the light most of the time. Once we wanted to come down we had to wait some time for the guide since he had disappeared and went to sleep instead guide us and tell more about the mount Sinai. On the way down he just pointed us and stayed back with some of us. Most of us made it back on our own. Then we waited more then an hour to get our original guide back. I am sure he also gone sleeping. The breakfast was below average. We were starving. Just had to fill us up. We even had to pay for water.. Hike and Sunrise were great but tour needs to be better organized.,March 2018,Sharm Touring Egypt - Day Tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303855-d3963217-Reviews-Sharm_Touring_Egypt_Day_Tours-Nabq_Bay_Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Si.html,"Nabq Bay, Egypt",attractions,3.0,4.5
