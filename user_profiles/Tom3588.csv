Great holiday,"Superb staff always obliging and helpful. Some fun shops just outside the hotel as good a price as in the Old town, if you barter well. Also a lovely 5 / 10 min walk through the sister hotel opposite down to the beach. Some decent slides in the water park for all ages. Good food and great cocktails every night in the panorama bar. Egypt seemed pretty empty of tourists right now, so no trouble doing any activity you want for a good price, I suggest you shop around a little rather than book up at your welcome meeting. Plenty of sun during the day but really cool at night when we went, even snowed on the pyramids! Only real hassle we had was when leaving at the airport and the trolley handlers being over demanding. Otherwise great holiday totally relaxing.",December 2013,Parrotel Aqua Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g303855-d736182-Reviews-Parrotel_Aqua_Park-Nabq_Bay_Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html,"Nabq Bay, Egypt",hotels,5.0,4.5
