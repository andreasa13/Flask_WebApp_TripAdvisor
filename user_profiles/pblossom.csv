The one-eyed man,"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king —or at least at an advantage. Restaurant choices were quite limited in Esperanza, so having to look for a decent place to eat for 3 days could be tough. Duffys offered a fairly large and varied menu, so we ended up there for lunch twice, having chicken Caesar, Cobb, regular salad and burgers. Food was so so. Service was without a smile. No bread to be had with the salads. The bar crowd was noisy, even at midday.",January 2020,Duffy's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147326-d1234869-Reviews-Duffy_s-Isla_de_Vieques_Puerto_Rico.html,Puerto Rico,restaurants,3.0,4.0
That’s not Italian,"Ordered a margarita pizza and the pasta of the day, which was meat lasagna. The margarita pizza didn’t even have basil on it! Just a thin layer of cheese over tomato sauce. The crust was underdone and tasteless. We had to ask for fresh basil and tear the leaves up to sprinkle them on the pizza ourselves. The meat and ricotta (I assume) blended together to form a mushy mass In the lasagna, with no flavor other than salty. Didn’t see or taste any mozzarella at all.",January 2020,L'Osteria Decanter,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147320-d10181468-Reviews-L_Osteria_Decanter-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html,Puerto Rico,restaurants,2.0,4.5
Awful food,"If you’re looking for decent food, walk right past this joint. The tortilla soup tasted like it was dumped from a can of tomato sauce, with some mushy puréed vegetables mixed in. The sopes was really salty.",January 2020,La Madre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147320-d1977271-Reviews-La_Madre-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html,Puerto Rico,restaurants,1.0,4.5
Room for improvement,"After all the fabulous reviews about the restaurant, my husband and I were looking forward to dining at Marmalade. We found the decor pleasing: a mixture of contemporary chic and subdued comfort. We chose the 4-course and 6-course dinners respectively. Mine consisted of pop-corn shrimp, golden beets, sea bass and coconut pineapple crisp. My husband had tuna tartare, ceviche, red beets, squash ramen, surf and turf (scallops and pork belly), and apple creme brûlée. We did not have paired wines but instead had glasses of Albariño and grenache blanc. Let me preface my review with this comment: opinions on food are inherently subjective. They are influenced by one’s culture, up-bringing, exposure, experiences and preferences. However, these factors also contribute to informed opinions. Marmalade’s creations were interesting and some were pretty good, but hardly superb. As we slowly wound our way through the courses, one recurring observation was that while each individual ingredient used to compose a dish might have been fresh, wonderful, and even impressive, there were too many of them tangled together, all fighting for attention. The end result was that they prevented the star ingredient to shine through. It’s like having too many brilliantly-clad and chattering bridesmaids around the demure bride who is in a simple monochrome gown, and who should have been the main focus but alas is diminished by the distraction. Or when you mix the seven beautiful colors of the rainbow (light), you just get plain white. Take the golden beet course. Each little round beet (there were 4 of them, pre-marinated in apple cider vinegar) is topped with hearts of palm, radish carpaccio, goat cheese and a marcona almond almost half the size of the beet itself. I was advised by the waiter to ‘eat the entire beet-pile like a sushi’ so as to experience the different tastes and textures at once. I love beets, and was expecting that wonderful earthy, slightly sweet taste of the golden beet to spread through my mouth, complemented perhaps by a tinge of smooth goat cheese. But I could not taste any distinctive flavor or experience distinctive textures, except the crunch of the almond. Astonishment was followed by disappointment. Similar experiences happened with the red beet course, the ‘ramen’ course, and the apple creme brûlée. The ceviche was better but the addition of avocado sullied the umami taste of the seafood. The scallops and accompanying vegetables and rice were very salty. The popcorn shrimp was cooked just right. The sea bass was good. The complementary white bean soup was delicious. The pineapple crisp was so-so. The portion sizes were perfect. We think a little restraint in integrating the ingredients may provide a more satisfying culinary enjoyment.",January 2020,Marmalade Restaurant & Wine Bar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g147320-d792961-Reviews-Marmalade_Restaurant_Wine_Bar-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html,Puerto Rico,restaurants,3.0,5.0
Out of this world! Chocoholics paradise!,"We came here for breakfast yesterday and had the most wonderful avocado toast and eggs, and French toast, accompanied by delicious hot chocolate.

Class and serenity,"We stayed 3 nights at the Malecon House and were impressed by many things. The hotel is in a prime location, on the beachfront near the west end of the main drag in Esperanza. The building and the surrounding areas were impeccably clean and well maintained, with beautifully trimmed trees and shrubbery, dotted with tempting patches of green grass that we were told the roaming horses on the island try to sneak in for a bite every chance they get when the sliding metal gate is inadvertently left open! Though open to the esplanade, the hotel exudes privacy and serenity. There’s a spacious parking area in front (behind the low sliding gate), private pool area with tables, chairs, chaises and overstuffed couches around the side, and rattan chairs by the front entry to just sit and enjoy the ocean view and clouds lazily drifting by in a bright blue sky, or stare with unfocused gaze at the palm trees waving in the gentle breeze and think of nothing, or people-watch. The serenity continues inside with clean designs and soothing colors, strategically placed chairs and benches that invite you to relax and drop your loads, whatever they may be. There’s a small but comfortable and bright sitting room with snacks and soft drinks (and wine in the evening) for purchase, self-serve. A library on the second floor and a rooftop with a great view are additional amenities. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, but unobtrusive. The only short comings we found were with the room itself, and the breakfasts. The room size was generous, but the beds sat on bulky wooden frames that creaked when one tossed and turned, and the corners were shin-bangers and toe-stubbers! Especially in the dark. The shower water could be temperamental, scalding hot one minute and ice cold the next. The pillows were many but none was comfortable. The breakfast was skimpy: cereals, packaged oatmeal and unimpressive little pastries, and the granola smelled rancid ( maybe change to a different kind without sunflower seeds?) The coffee was drinkable, but we were spoiled by the fantastic freshly ground lattes and espressos in our San Juan hotel.",January 2020,Malecon House,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147326-d1569786-Reviews-Malecon_House-Isla_de_Vieques_Puerto_Rico.html,Puerto Rico,hotels,4.0,5.0
That’s a Caribbean beach!,"What a beautiful beach. Clear azure water near the beach and deep blue further out invite you to go any depth you choose at your own pace. Gentle waves, fine fine sand. The beach slopes very gradually into the ocean, and there are no rocks or pebbles on the bottom. No crashing waves, so you can wade or swim comfortably as the water gently caresses you. The water temperature is perfect. It makes for a great beach for families. It’s a bit remote and there are long stretches of gravel roads but we made it in a ‘golf cart’ with no problem.",January 2020,Playa La Chiva,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g17464577-d1819723-Reviews-Playa_La_Chiva-Puerto_Ferro_Isla_de_Vieques_Puerto_Rico.html,"Isla de Vieques, Puerto Rico",attractions,5.0,5.0
Even a Portland OR foodie would be impressed.,"We know because we’re from Portland, Oregon. the food tasted so familiar because the chef hails from Portland! Fabulous dinner. The salads were classic NW: my husband had the bitter and tangy arugula salad with orange slices and I had the incredible roasted pear salad on a bed of endive and radicchio, flavors that complimented each other really well. For entrees I had the surf and turf (seared scallops and pork belly), my husband had giant prawns in spicy and tangy Thai curry, complimented by sweet pineapple and grilled baby bok choi. Glasses of full bodied malbec worked really well with the rich flavors. Finished with a warm coconut bread pudding. We were disappointed that the local spiny lobster was not available because the fisherman failed to bring some in. We’re going back on Saturday again to try our luck.",January 2020,El Quenepo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2091641-d776130-Reviews-El_Quenepo-Esperanza_Isla_de_Vieques_Puerto_Rico.html,"Isla de Vieques, Puerto Rico",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Over-rated as a restaurant,"Stopped here for lunch because of great reviews on TA. Had hummus served with pita and fried plantain pieces. The hummus was very garlicky but otherwise not flavorful; not enough olive oil. The fried calamari were in small thin pieces, the fish and chips used local fish, which tasted fresh and flaky but had little flavor. Cold beer and passion fruit juice were standard.

Fantastic food and great service,"My husband and I were in Aguadilla and wanted to find a nice place for lunch (Tuesday Jan 14). Marina’s Restsurant was highly recommended. However, when we got there, it was closed, despite the fact that all the internet searches about the place said it was open. We came across Pena Blanca quite by accident and what a delightful surprise! The food was excellent. We had crab on fried plantain, fish soup with crusty bread, and an updated spinach artichoke cheese dip with fried bread. Cold tangy passion fruit juice was a perfect foil on the hot humid afternoon.

Excellent choice!,"We booked a 2 week trip to PR in October 2019 to escape the typical cold and wet January weather of the Northwest. We chose PR because we wanted to contribute to its economy after the devastating hurricanes. Alas Ponce was hit by 2 large quakes (5.8, 6.4) in the 2 days before we were scheduled to leave! Although UA gave us the option to change our flights without charge and we could cancel some of the hotel bookings, we decided to go anyway. Our first stop was San Juan and then Ponce for 4 nights, but the Ponce had lost power, and the area was (and continues to be) rocked by numerous aftershocks. So we decided to go to Mayagüez instead. We booked 4 nights at the Holiday Inn (directly with the hotel) and have been absolutely delighted by our experience. (We leave tomorrow for Vieques). The hotel looks fresh and up-dated, both exterior and interior. Parking is convenient and free. The hotel is not fancy but impressionably comfortable and functional. We were given a room on the top (6th) floor with an (faraway) ocean view, 2 Queen beds and lots of room to move around. The room design is the best we have come across yet in our frequent travels both domestic and international. The room is not luxurious and the artwork and furnishings are common but someone gave a lot of thought to the layout. The beds face a long credenza, the center of which is a built-in vertical column on which was mounted a 42” TV, and below it a bank of electrical outlets, USB ports, HDMI input, computer/video input, and audio input. How convenient is that! The mini fridge and safe is on the right end of the credenza, a table on rollers (tucked under the credenza so no counter space is lost) is on the left end, with a high back chair (on rollers and adjustable so it can be tucked under the table). The table can be used as work space or rolled to between the beds as a dining table! How clever is that! The bedding is simple but very comfortable, with 4 pillows of various firmness. There’s an outdoor pool, a small gym, and a very clean, very new coin-operated laundry room. They thought of everything for the traveler’s convenience. The second floor has a business center with computers. USGS, Red Cross and other emergency/disaster response groups have been using the hotel as a staging area because of the excellent Geological and Earth Sciences department of the University of PR at Mayagüez, and because of its location —- close to Ponce but not close enough to be seriously affected by the quakes. We have felt small tremors during the last 3 days from the continued aftershocks around Ponce, but nothing to be alarmed about. I highly recommend this hotel. It has been a long time since we’ve stayed at a HI, and we’re delighted to say that it’s not the old HI we thought it was —- at least not this one!",January 2020,Holiday Inn Mayaguez & Tropical Casino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147321-d151796-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Mayaguez_Tropical_Casino-Mayaguez_Puerto_Rico.html,Puerto Rico,hotels,5.0,4.0
Feast on the view,"The food was good but not spectacular, and it was quite expensive, but the location and view were worth every penny. The restaurant hugs the hillside below the jostling, tourist-filled promenade so you’re far ( at least far enough ) from the madding crowd to heave a sigh of relief. Sit under the shady awnings with a glass of cold local beer or chilled local wine on a perfect hot day and a cloudless sky, stare into the deep blue waters of the caldera and the colorful moored cruise ships and you understand the magic of Santorini.

Your Greece experience is incomplete without seeing THE acropolis.,"Do not go directly to the acropolis unprepared. You may have a photo or 2 grinning in front of the Parthenon to show off to your friends at home but you have not really appreciated it. First, read up on Greek history in general and the Parthenon specifically. Then go to the acropolis museum and learn all about what you would see (or would have seen if the structures were intact and the artifacts not ‘removed’ to other museums). Then climb up slowly and with deliberation and anticipation. Look at all that now remain with the knowledge you have acquired to fill the gaps. Let the site and the sight move your spirit.

But the food was fabulous. Try the ancient Greek salad (not what you would expect but fabulous), warm mashed lemony fava beans with capers (perfect to dip the pita bread in), and and smoked pork.

One museum you must not miss,"The Archeological Museum in Athens is one of the best museums in the world. The incredible artifacts are from various archeological sites in Greece.

You need at least several hours to feast your eyes and immerse yourself in ancient Greece. So have a stout breakfast and start early to get ahead of the crowds. By the time you’re hungry, head over to a wonderful little restaurant within walking distance called Saligaros (snails).

Not THE acropolis but still worth visiting.,"Lindos was definitely worth visiting. It’s a ways from Old Town Rhodos but guided day tours were plenty. It was founded by the Dorians around 10th century BC and was a major trading center for the Greeks and Phoenicians. Its acropolis had a big temple of Athena Lindia, but fell into ruins in early medieval times and later was partly overlaid by a fortress built by the Knights of St. John to defend the island against the Ottomans. The sheltered St. Paul’s Bay’s alluring turquoise water, and the quaint fishing village perched on the hillside were marvelous sights. Just outside of the ruins was a ceramic studio run by a family of potters whose works were fabulous.",September 2019,Acropolis of Lindos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g227884-d621960-Reviews-Acropolis_of_Lindos-Lindos_Rhodes_Dodecanese_South_Aegean.html,"Rhodes, Greece",attractions,4.0,4.5
Disappointing Indian food,"Like another reviewer, we wanted a change from Greek food and were happy to find an indian restaurant within walking distance from our hotel. We ordered samosa, lamb vindaloo, rice and nan. We wanted raita and was told it was not on the menu and we’d have to pay to have them specially make it. An Indian restaurant with no raita?!

Treat your tastebuds and your eyes!,"The restaurant was a hidden (at least for tourists like us who couldn't pronounce its name when asking for directions, even as we stood in front of the nearby Dore Cafe, totally confused) jewel. But when we did get to the restaurant, we were wowed by a classy establishment with a breathtaking view. The service was impeccable, the food was wonderful, and the value was excellent. We had an appetizer that resembled egg rolls (!) and a fragrant salad of local organic greens, followed by osso bucco with mashed potatoes, and prawns with fresh pasta, accompanied by a bottle of local white wine similar to a Viognier, finishing with an interesting dessert suggested by the server. I regret that we didn't note the names of the dishes but I've posted photos here so perhaps the restaurant can enlighten us! We spoke with the young manager while savoring the dessert and raki, and learned that it's a fairly new restaurant that was promoting the concept of using local organic ingredients and presenting smaller specialized dishes.

Favorite restaurant in Heraklion,"Great food and good value. The place was hopping when we arrived for dinner around 8:30 without any booking (be sure to make reservations in advance). We waited about 30 minutes, sitting at the outdoor bar, watching long tables of al fresco diners laughing, drinking, eating and obviously having a wonderful time. When it was our turn, we were led into a small dining room (one of many, apparently) that combined country warmth and city chic. Strings of dried mushrooms hung on a rough wall, cruets of local olive oil sat on a narrow wooden table and baskets of dried herbs lined up under the table made for a welcoming and cosy surrounding for dining with any group size or occasion. Crusty homemade bread was brought to us in a wooden bread box (!), accompanied by a generous quantity of olive oil on a large glass dish sprinkled with herbs and lined with olives. We had the Peskesi Cretan salad (similar to a Greek salad but with special touches like purslane and a local creamy goat cheese that had a fabulous mouth-feel), followed by Grandma's chicken with olives and local pasta (deep satisfying flavors), and an exquisitely grilled pork souvlaki. The portions were huge! We had red wine with the meal.

Dinner at the rooftop balcony,"We dined at The Balcony Restaurant and Bar on our first night in Athens. Although we were very jet-lagged (flew all the way from Oregon), a short nap and a hot shower revived us enough to go searching for dinner. The Balcony was a convenient stroll from our hotel in the makrygianni (the Acropolis area). We were seated at a table on the small rooftop. While there was no real view to speak of, the cool night breeze gently wafting through the vines on the trellis made for a very pleasant setting. We started with some grilled pies stuffed with cheese and wild greens, followed by the Balcony salad (spinach, figs, pistachio, a creamy goat cheese and a lovely rhubarb vinaigrette dressing). I had the fresh fish of the day (forgot the name; it was a medium firm white fish) served with a puree of leeks and celery, not too exciting. My husband had the mushroom risotto, which he gobbled up with a couple of glasses of local red wine! The hour was much later than we normally dined, so we skipped the tempting desserts.

Restaurant close to Acropolis Museum,"We stayed at a hotel near the Acropolis Museum and were able to walk to many good restaurants for dinner, Mani Mani was one of them. It had a chic yet intimate feel, an unpretentious setting and quietly bustling waiters. We started with anchovies, olives and bread. The Mani Mani salad was a nice alternative to the usual Greek salad, with a wonderful soft goat cheese instead of feta. The traditional fresh pasta with veal was topped with a nutty Graviera cheese that invited deep inhalation from me!

More than just the incredible buildings.,"The drive from Loreto to the mission was quite interesting, passing parts of the course of the Baja 1000 off-road race, private ranches, a small chapel at Rancho Las Parras, palm canyons, and old fig trees that ""tap"" vertically for 20 to 40 feet, with lateral roots latching onto rocks for stability, all to garner any moisture they can get in this parched landscape. The strong desire to survive was totally awe-inspiring.
The mission itself was amazing, but we were equally impressed by the efforts of the early Jesuits to survive and sustain themselves here. There were extensive olive orchards and other fruit and cultivated gardens, fed by an ingenious system of canals using gravity to deliver water from a nearby river to the fields and households, and reservoirs that store water for irrigation. Definitely worth a visit.
Sight-seeing companies in Loreto offered tours to SJ at US$69 per person. My husband and I decided to be adventurous and hired the resourceful taxi that followed us to our hotel and offered to take us there. The taxi had a company logo and phone number, and the driver was in uniform, with his name on the shirt. We felt pretty safe, but we took photos of both with our iPhone for our record, just in case. The driver spoke sufficiently good English, and knew the sights along the way as well as about San Javier, so we had a wonderful 4- hour tour for 1000 pesos (about $55). We liked the driver so much we asked him to take us to the airport a few days later!

We did a lot of walking along the Malecon, back and forth between the estuary and the marina. There were many sea birds: gulls, terns, whimbrels, marbled godwits, sandpipers, egrets, herons, brown pelicans and even a couple of frigate birds one day. There were lots of brown pelicans, fishing and sunning themselves on the beach or sitting on boats at the marina. We never tired watching them dive into the water and, after resurfacing, we would cheer when the bird was successful (tossing the catch up and swallowing it), or ""awwwwed"" and wished it better luck when the dive was fruitless. One evening, near the estuary, we saw hundreds of pelicans repeated dive into a small patch of water for fish. We could see shimmering close to the surface, possibly herrings that had gathered.

Nice hotel in Loreto,"My husband and I vacationed in Loreto, Mexico in late January 2019. Stayed 7 nights. Through Booking.com, got a room with Queen bed ($626 incl taxes and fees, and free cancellation up to 5 days prior to arrival). Asked for room w 2 Queens (Room 5) on arrival and got it with no extra charge. Nice room on second floor, clean and well maintained, tiled floor, ceiling fans, microwave, toaster, small fridge, coffee maker, hot water pot, dishes and silverware, pots/pans and a 2-ring cooking plate (we didn't do any cooking). Breakfast was not included but coffee, tea bags, a plate of fruit (oranges and bananas) and 2 sweet buns came with the room, plus 2 bottles of drinking water each day. Water from tap was not potable but fine for brushing teeth. Ensuite bathroom had a tiled shower, good water pressure and lots of hot water. Only complaint: windows had no screen so if you want fresh air, you risk insects. Hardly any flies but I was bitten by mosquitoes. Room did have A/C.
The hotel is very conveniently located: within easy walking distance to restaurants, the seaside, grocery stores and banks. (Banco Azteca has the lowest ATM fee). There's a small but lovely courtyard and a cosy roof top terrace. Only gripe: the church nearby chimed every hour, starting at 6am (!) ending at 9pm. Fortunately we were always able to fall back asleep after being awakened by the 6 o'clock ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring""! The chimes seemed louder at 6, noon and 3 than the other hours. All hotels around the area could hear them.
Restaurants we ate at: Mi Loreto (very good), Cafe Ole (VG; cash only), La Palapa (OK), Mezzaluna (Excellent empanadas and good pizza), Orlandos (good), Pan Que Pan (poor; cash only), Sabor (Excellent but out of the way and expensive; cash only).
Hotel employees were wonderful. We loved our stay and would recommend the hotel.
GOOD NEWS: the hotel is building a new annex across the alley which will have 8 rooms, a pool, a restaurant and more parking. Estimated to open in spring 2020.",January 2019,Posada del Cortes Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150772-d1950131-Reviews-Posada_del_Cortes_Hotel-Loreto_Baja_California.html,"Loreto, Mexico",hotels,4.0,4.5
NOT a delight at all,"So many things wrong I hardly know where to start! The location is its best feature, and the breakfast was quite nice. Other than that, the hotel rates poorly. It is old and smelly, and badly needs upgrading. The owner must realize this because it appeared to be in various states of improvement. But attempts to hide the existing defects were dishonest and harmful to guests.

Based on reviews on the internet, the hotel seemed a decent mid-range one. So I booked 2 rooms for 4 nights and asked for non-smoking, interconnecting rooms. We were never told that there were no interconnecting rooms. They gave us 2 rooms on the same floor. The twin room (occupied by my sisters) had carpeting, the single room (I took) had wood-like floor. Both my sisters and I noticed that the rooms smelled bad: theirs was a strange eye-watering type of smell and mine was a combination of mold and bleach. After being in the room for an hour, my sisters started having horrific headaches and sinus problems. I started coughing in my room. We told the front desk that we could not stay in those rooms, and they switched us to a different set of rooms on another floor. The twin room was not-carpeted, and smelled much better (but not great). My room was about the same, but I was able to open the windows and let some fresh air in. The front desk employee was quite apologetic, and mentioned that the problem with the twin room was most likely the carpeting. It was apparently giving off fumes that had made other guests complain, and the hotel was going to replace it with wood-like material. So why on earth would they have continued to assign that room to guests?! The next day the smells in my room got worse. I returned after maid-service to find a machine that emitted a strong smell. It claimed to ""disinfect"", ""kill germs"" and ""purify"" the room. Heavens! What could be in that room that would have needed such cleansing? The smell reminded me of some strong ionizer air purifiers I have seen in the U.S. When mixed with the smell of bleach used to clean the bathroom, it made me quite nauseous. I immediately removed it from my room, but they kept it going in the hallway outside my door. Only after I protested did they remove it from the hallway. I had to again open all the windows to try to clear the smells. But the pillows and bedding were infused and I had to ask for new ones. Obviously the hotel has serious smell issues because there were also scent emitting machines everywhere: in the coffee lounge, the public bathrooms, the breakfast room and hallways. For those of you allergic or sensitive to strong scents, BEWARE.

The phones did not work, for calling room-to-room or dialing out. When we complained, they brought different phones to the rooms, but that didn't help. Later, we found out that in fact the entire phone system was down, and had been for days. The front desk said we were welcome to use the phones at the front desk whenever we liked! On the morning we checked out, the front desk employee triumphantly informed us that the phone system was finally fixed!

The hair-dryer (affixed to the wall) in the twin room did not work. When informed of it, housekeeping immediately brought a plug-in, no questions asked!

The beds were not stable and kept ""rolling"" away from the wall and causing one's pillows to fall down the space created in the middle of the night.

After the first night, I seriously considered cancelling the reservation and moving to another hotel. But the hotel had insisted on charging me for the entire stay when I checked in. I thought it was strange but I didn't suspect any foul play. After the various incidents and complaints, I realized that it was the hotel's way of discouraging dissatisfied guests from cancelling and leaving! I brought that up with the manager and she feigned surprise that it was not standard practice to charge up front! I said it was quite normal for a hotel to take an imprint of the credit card upon check-in but the bill was payable at the end of the stay. She said she would ""reflect"" it to the powers that be!

I will definitely never return to stay at this hotel, and I would not recommend it.",October 2017,Delight Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g13806900-d505600-Reviews-Delight_Hotel-Songshan_Taipei.html,"Songshan, Taipei",hotels,1.0,4.0
A true gem,"What a delight! The hotel went through major renovations this year, and the result was impressive: modern design with clean and pleasing lines and colors, unfussy yet comfortable interior decorations, European style efficient, bright and welcoming kitchen where great breakfasts were served every morning. One would expect to see this type and quality of bed and breakfast in Europe or the U.S., but to find it amidst stodgy dark traditional hotels and lodgings in Sun Moon Lake was a fabulous surprise. The service was impeccable. The hosts were passionate about making each guest's stay a good memory. And they succeeded.

The only reason I am not giving the hotel a 5 star rating is because of our room situation. We were three elderly sisters (80, 73, 69), and when I booked, Wayne suggested that we could book 2 separate rooms, or take one room with twin beds and add a futon. He assured me that the room would be big enough and the futon a nice one. The rooms were quite pricey so I chose the latter option. The futon was indeed thick and comfortable, but it took up the entire long wooden bench along the wall with the window, where one might have used as luggage rack, so we did not have much room for our clothes or luggage (there was no closet), and we had no place to sit except on our beds. We were not provided with any chairs. The only place to hang a few clothes was a short bar high above one end of the wooden bench, and could only be reached by stepping on the bench. Quite impractical and even precarious (I urge Wayne to modify this feature to avoid possible accident from a guest falling off the bench while hanging or retrieving clothes). I suppose we could have rolled up the futon during the day and used the bench as a seating area, but the bench was set about 3 feet from the wall, wide enough to accommodate the futon's width but too deep to be used as seats, especially for those of us who are used to sit on chairs with backs.",October 2017,Laurel Villa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g13808635-d633818-Reviews-Laurel_Villa-Yuchi_Nantou.html,"Yuchi, Nantou",hotels,4.0,5.0

Location a plus but the name a minus,"I booked two rooms at this hotel because of its proximity to the Taichung Train Station and tour bus stations for buses to Sun Moon Lake. But unbeknownst to us, there were several hotels in the same area with ""Plaza"" in their names, which caused a lot of confusion with cab drivers, who knew very little or no English and demanded Chinese names, which were all different. We were dropped off at the wrong hotel more than once and had to find our way to the right one by asking for help from shop keepers along the way. The hotel itself is old and dusty and tired. The rooms are small, the bathrooms smelled, and the shower drain clogged. The staff at the front desk (2 young men and a young woman) were cold and unfriendly. We asked for directions to banks and the Nantou bus station (there were several tour bus operators around as Taichung is the main jump off point to SML) and were given a small map and told to search for the right one ourselves! Exasperated, we ended up having a cab take us there. The cab driver gave us a funny look and asked for NT$100 up front --- it was 2 minutes away! The breakfast was OK but the staff was equally indifferent! I would not recommend this hotel.",October 2017,Butler Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g13792757-d2027156-Reviews-Butler_Hotel-Central_District_Taichung.html,"Central District, Taichung",hotels,2.0,4.0
Fabulous hotel and staff,"My two sisters and I stayed in Tainan for 2 nights. I booked two rooms --- one with two beds and one with a single bed, requesting non-smoking and interconnecting rooms. Anna the front desk manager was fabulous. She gave us connecting rooms, one with 2 queen beds and one with a king bed! Both rooms were very spacious, with generous seating areas and comfortable lounge chairs. We arrived in the late morning, several hours before check-in time. She apologized that only one room was available and suggested we put our luggage in that one and go out for lunch while they hurried with getting the other room ready. She showed us on a map the various areas of town we might be interested in, and the best street food to be found.

The hotel is located away from downtown, in a quiet area with parks nearby and a large cultural center next door where local folks gathered in the morning to exercise and do taichi. The hotel lobby is lovely and spacious, with a fine bakery obviously popular with locals because it was always crowded! There were displays of art work, books and poetry instead of kitschy gift shops. A western style wedding reception was in progress in the basement banquet rooms. ALL the staff was friendly, courteous and helpful A very classy hotel indeed.

Yet just a couple of streets away, there was a market which bustled with weekend morning traffic, locals shopping for fresh poultry, vegetables, tofu and other ingredients for the meals of the day. Many also stopped at the various stalls piled with cooked food, including typical Chinese breakfast items that made your mouths water. Serene monks in flowing yellow robes walked among the shoppers, quietly chanting and gently nodding to acknowledge donations of food and alms from shoppers when given.

The next day while browsing yet other food streets (Tainan is famous for street food), we came upon a beautiful temple that was holding a funereal event for some cherished person. There were flower wreaths everywhere, loud music, fire crackers, and mourners in white giving the departed a rowdy send-off! We were also lucky enough to chance upon a traveling opera troupe that had set up a stage and chairs along the street!

A Standout among mid-range hotels,"In early October, my two sisters and I went on a nostalgic trip back to Hong Kong, where we had lived almost 50 years ago. I chose Dorsett Wanchai after careful research on various internet sites, including TripAdvisor. I made the booking 6 months in advance and was able to get a good price, and asked for non-smoking, connecting rooms on a higher floor with a view of the city or the race course. We were accommodated in every respect: had interconnected twin and queen rooms on the 19th floor facing the race course. The rooms were smallish but did not feel cramped, with nice bathrooms. Rooms were clean and comfortable, with plush modern bedding and pillows. It was very convenient to be able to have group chats any time we wanted but also privacy, especially when we had different sleep schedules. We stayed for eleven (11) wonderful nights.

The hotel is very conveniently located at the borders of Wanchai/Causeway Bay/Happy Valley, especially for non-business travelers. Easy walk to lots of restaurants (big and small) and shopping, including Times Square. (For business travelers, it may be more convenient to stay in the Central district, where most major first tier hotels are. Tourists visiting HK for the first time and who want a really ""touristy"" atmosphere may want to stay in the Kowloon Tsim Sha Tsui area.) For those of us who aren't or don't want to be ""tourists"" but still want all the amenities and conveniences at a more reasonable price, Wanchai/Causeway Bay is a perfect choice.

Public transportation is really convenient in HK. Taxis are plentiful but why bother when buses, trams, the subway and ferries will take you where you want to go 95% of the time. (An Octopus card is a must if you stay in HK for more than 3 days.) There's a bus stop just outside the hotel (to Repulse Bay, Stanley Market etc), a tram stop a 5-minute walk, and the Causeway Bay Metro Station a 10-minute walk (or 3-5 minutes by hotel shuttle). The hotel offers a FREE shuttle service to and from several stops, with frequent runs for much of the day, including the CBMS (which links to a fabulous easy-to-use subway system), Central business district (short walk to the Star Ferry and jet boats to Macau), and the Airport Express Bus Terminal (a taxi from AEBT to the hotel costs about $15). We got into a routine of taking the hotel shuttle to CBMS in the morning, having Chinese breakfasts at various small restaurants in that area, riding the Metro to wherever we decided to explore for the day, returning in the afternoon to the CBMS, buying mouth-watering freshly baked goods at a nearby shop (for afternoon tea back at the hotel), and leisurely waiting to be picked up by the hotel shuttle!

The staff of DW was professional, friendly, attentive and helpful. Maid service was courteous and accommodating. It was altogether a really satisfying experience. (We were even lucky enough to watch pre-season horse-racing practices from our hotel room windows!) I would definitely stay there again, and highly recommend it.",October 2017,Dorsett Wanchai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294217-d483282-Reviews-Dorsett_Wanchai-Hong_Kong.html,"Hong Kong, China",hotels,5.0,4.0

Paradise in Paradise,"Trina and Shai were wonderful hosts, always ready to help with itinerary planning, giving driving directions, suggesting restaurants and shopping.

The breakfasts were creative and plentiful, lots of fresh fruit, followed by interesting and delicious dishes that flowed from their well-traveled and catering experiences. Their special qualities are complimented by the fabulous home in the coffee-growing hills overlooking Kona bay, where you can lounge on the lanai with a glass of wine (or fruit juice) and watch the sun set and feel the scented cool breeze caressing your sunburnt skin.

bed bugs?,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel in room 250 for one night before flying home to Portland. We slept in separate double beds. The sheets looked and felt rumpled. The next morning he felt scratchy here and there but did not pay much attention as it was very early and we were focused on getting to the airport. The itching got worse as the day wore on. By the time we got home and we examined him, his legs, waist and arms were covered with numerous red dots. We did some research on the internet and determined that the bites were from bed bugs. I was for some reason spared. We read on the internet that some people are not affected by bed bug bites while others have severe reactions.
We notified the hotel and were brusquely handed to the general manager, who, after a couple of hours, sent us a ""report"" from a pest company that said it did an ""inspection"" of the room and found no bed bugs.
