COMPLEX MONTH LONG TRIP MADE EASY,"Our trip to Greece was a month long and included a cruise, a land tour, and 2 weeks of traveling from Athens, Mykonos, and Santorini. I normally book my own trips but because of the ferry schedules I chose a travel agency. Vicky Asloglou worked closely with me and was very patient. Even though we sometimes had little time between events, it all came off without a hitch. Katerina Trigoni was especially helpful while in Athens, even showing up at 4:30 am to assist us with our flight home. We had one mishap duing the whole month. The ferry from Mykonsos to Santorini was substituted with another, which caused us to arrive almost 2 hours early. The person picking us up was not notified so we had to take a taxi on our own. No huge issue. However, not only did the agency refund our taxi fare, they paid for our dinner that night. I'm embarrassed to say it was our most expensive meal of the trip. All in all, if I were to go back to Greece I would absolutely use Fantasy Travel.",September 2019,Fantasy Travel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d2442390-Reviews-Fantasy_Travel-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,5.0
EXCELLENT FOOD AND LOCATION,"Stayed over night at the Seahorse Inn. Across the street is the restaurant on the San Clemente Pier. Had breakfast on the restaurant side of the pier. Seafood is as fresh as it gets. Fantastic egg dishes with crab!!! On the other side of the pier is the cocktail lounge. Had wonderful lunch of fresh Dungeness crab and wine. Later drinks at the bar.

DEPENDS ON YOUR TASTES,"I'm not a fan of, what I consider greasy sandwiches. But if you like that you'll probably like this place. Had a groupon and went midweek, in between lunch and dinner.

PERFECT FOR EVERYTHING,"The hotel is beautiful and the beds are comfortable, which is a lot to say after spending 1 month traveling throughout Japan. The free shuttle service to Meguro train station makes it a breeze to travel the ""loop"" and see just about everything in the area. The airport bus to Haneda is cheap and makes it so very easy to come and go. Doesn't run often enough, so check schedule to see if it works for you. Hint...even if you have to get to the airport hours early it's ok because you can store your bags and hop on a monorail right from the departure lobby. You get in a last day of sightseeing versus hanging out until flight time (take it to the last stop...nice temple, lots of restaurants...30 minutes each way.)",October 2017,Sheraton Miyako Hotel Tokyo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g14131029-d306375-Reviews-Sheraton_Miyako_Hotel_Tokyo-Shirokanedai_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html,"Shirokanedai, Japan",hotels,5.0,4.0
THE LOCATION IS WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"Having just left the Sheraton in Tokyo, arriving at this hotel was a bit of a shock. Did not look like it's website pictures. After getting over the shock we came to love the location. Short walk to the ferry building and on the waterfront of a working harbor...not a marina as the pictures would suggest. Also walking distance to all the restaurants and shops in town. We spent a month traveling around Japan and Ishigaki...especially Taketomi Island turned out to be our favorite place. We live at the beach in So. Cal. so it was great for us. I'd stay at this hotel again, just because of the location. There are nicer ""resorts"" but they are far from everything and you'd have to taxi everywhere or stay on the property...but then why bother to travel all that distance to only see a hotel.",October 2017,Hotel East China Sea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g14210285-d1068095-Reviews-Hotel_East_China_Sea-Ishigaki_jima_Ishigaki_Okinawa_Prefecture.html,"Ishigaki-jima, Japan",hotels,2.0,4.0

"GOOD FOOD, OK LOCATION","I've been here a few times over the past several years. For me that says it all. The food is good, the prices are a tad high but not outrageous...but the atmosphere and location just don't do it for me. When I really like a place I'm there several times a month. There are just too many great seafood places with great atmosphere and ocean view. If you live in this neighborhood and walk it could be a ""go to"" place. I'm a few miles further down the beach and there are just too many other choices...Dukes, Rusty Pelican, Boathouse, Captain Jacks...",February 2017,Fish Camp,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32513-d1812263-Reviews-Fish_Camp-Huntington_Beach_California.html,"Huntington Beach, California",restaurants,4.0,4.5
IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER,"Whether you're looking for a fantastic location or an excellent hotel, this is it. The hotel itself is amazing. Beautiful, well kept, with wonderful staff. It's a short walk to Seaport Village (out the back door actually), Gaslamp Quarter, and the USS Midway. Not too mention the tons of excellent restaurants in the area.

WHAT A SURPRISE!,"I was traveling with a group of 8 friends for 3 weeks along the Florida coast and Bahamas. Fort Lauderdale was to be our ""time out"" stay. Thought we'd do laundry and have some down time. Instead we discovered a beautiful beach, fantastic restaurants and nightlife. Everyone in the group voted this as the best surprise of the trip.",May 2017,Fort Lauderdale Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34227-d527268-Reviews-Fort_Lauderdale_Beach-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",attractions,5.0,4.5
A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH,"Don't be put off by the exterior or location. Inside you will find a setting that makes you feel you are in the French Quarter! The food is fantastic and the hush puppies just keep coming. The prices are crazy. We'd planned to go to Joe's Stone Crabs in Miami and pay their price, but once we saw Stone Crabs on Dewey's menu plans changed. They were as fresh and wonderful as any I've had, at about half the price. Also had the shrimp gumbo, while I can't say it was the best ever...it was delicious. Everyone in our group of 8 was thrilled with their meal (fried shrimp, fish, and more) and rated this as one of the top stops on our three week vacation through Florida and the Bahamas. Almost forgot to mention the service...they make you feel wanted...not like just another tourist.",April 2017,Catfish Deweys,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34227-d630072-Reviews-Catfish_Deweys-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",restaurants,5.0,4.0
AS GOOD AS IT GETS FOR THIS PRICE RANGE,"We needed a room for one night before boarding a cruise ship. Could not have picked a better spot. Large rooms, clean, and a fantastic pool area. There was shuffleboard, a huge chess set, beautiful pool, and a covered cabana as well as several BBQ's. We actually wished we'd booked longer so we could have taken advantage of all the amenities. On top of that, they let us leave our TWO cars parked in front of the office while we were on the cruise...FOR FREE! Parking at the cruise lot was about $224, so this was not a minor thing. Location is great for restaurants and attractions.",April 2017,Best Western Palm Beach Lakes Inn,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g34731-d79949-Reviews-Best_Western_Palm_Beach_Lakes_Inn-West_Palm_Beach_Florida.html,"West Palm Beach, Florida",hotels,5.0,4.0
VERY NICE LOCATION,"As other reviews have stated the island is still in recovery after last year's hurricane. Lighthouse Point is the only hotel open on the Grand Lucayan property. It was very nice with a beautiful beach and grounds. The rooms are nice as well...not fantastic, but nice.
Unfortunately the staff is just about the most unfriendly group I have met in all my journeys around the world. Beyond unfriendly, I actually heard them speaking ill of customers behind their backs for no reason (like asking for basic service in polite terms). This is a shame because the island is in dire need of tourism. The only people I can say actually seemed to care about the customers were Pauline (I hope that's correct) at the pool bar and the head of security (forgot her name). I'm afraid the vast majority's negativity will negatively impact the resort.
The ""all inclusive"" is a good deal for basic food and any kind of drink you want. The down side is that the buffets are basically the same every meal. There are great restaurants down the road at the Market Place, so no one goes hungry.
As a traveler who hopes to add to the places I visit, I encourage people to go here. Maybe tip more than you normally would (although a generous tip is included on EVERYTHING automatically) to help these people out. They are working drastically reduced hours just so everyone can keep a job until the island is up and fully functional again.",April 2017,Lighthouse Pointe at Grand Lucayan Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g147420-d12050905-Reviews-Lighthouse_Pointe_at_Grand_Lucayan_Resort-Freeport_Grand_Bahama_Island_Bahamas.html,Grand Bahama Island,hotels,4.0,3.5
LOTS OF FUN,"Lots of international restaurants; Greek, Irish, Mexican, Sushi and more. Also many shops. Some with nice items, some with trinkets you probably see at every tourist stop in the world. Several fun bars. The Glass Bottom Boat tours are great. I live at the beach and have never seen sharks like that...wow!

Also, they have conch shell jewelry that is just beautiful. Something you could dress up or down. I kept meaning to buy something but got distracted and didn't.

You can do better in the area.,"Even though we are Hyatt Platinum members we were treated poorly at check in and given the worst room 204. Fine, whatever. You can't always be special. However after unpacking and reveling in our view of the parking lot we discover the
sink's drainage is slow. And the Toilet over flows. Slow response to the situation causing us to be late for dinner reservations with friends. Even though we remained calm and pleasant the front desk response was unacceptable. They ended up giving us a drink voucher for our trouble.

CHARMING HOTEL IN GREAT AREA,"We go to SF often and have stayed in every level of hotel. Our favorites are the Grand Hyatt on Market and Harbor Court Hotel. We find ourselves staying more and more at the Harbor Court simply because it is so charming and we are treated like guests, not just a nameless person occupying a room. Rebecca arranged for their towncar to pick us up and return us to the airport. We were greeted every time we left or returned to the hotel from sightseeing. When we wanted to go to Fisherman's Warf they arranged for a car (small fee).
The location is perfect. Right across from the Ferry Building with all kinds of food and wine. There are many hotels around Fisherman's Warf, but that's a little too busy and touristy for our tastes. We prefer to use the abundant public transportation or walk to the hustle bustle areas and return to Harbor Court for the evenings. Not to say there aren't great restaurants in the area. Within a half block of the hotel there are 4 fantastic places. The sushi bar next to the hotel is fantastic. Boulevard Restaurant on the corner is magnificent. We hadn't made reservations so were seated at the chef's bar. What a treat, we were able to watch a gourmet restaurant at work...and then the food...wow. It is a bit pricey, but oh so worth it.
As an added treat every morning there is free coffee in the ""living room"" downstairs as well as free wine from 5-6 each evening. Perfect for having a quick drink before heading out for the evening. We even played chess with the large set in front of the fireplace!!!
We really had to think hard before choosing the Harbor over the Hyatt. We are Hyatt Gold or Platinum members. It came down to the personal treatment and the charm of the hotel (not to mention the free coffee and wine). Our choice was reinforced when we went over to the Hyatt for cocktails and were pretty much ignored, having to wave servers in to order and then to get the check.
If there is a negative to Harbor Court, it's the size of the windows. We had a beautiful view of the Bay and the Oakland Bay Bridge, but being an old building the windows are very small. But then again, it's the charm of the old building that appealed to us.
I don't remember the numbers but I think Harbor costs less than Hyatt. Sorry Hyatt I still love you!!",October 2016,Harbor Court Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81022-Reviews-Harbor_Court_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html,"San Francisco, California",hotels,5.0,4.5
GREAT BAR/SUSHI RESTAURANT,"This restaurant is attached to the Harbor Court Hotel and we're generally not a fan of those types of restaurants. This one however exceeded all our expectations. Great Happy Hour, very good sushi bar (more rolls on menu than sashimi offerings for our taste, but very good). The staff makes you feel like old friends (except the sushi chefs, who I guess think they are too cool. We've eaten at the best, Nobu and had great interaction, so whatever).

PERFECT LOCATION,"We began in Papeete, Tahiti then cruised on Paul Gaugin to many islands between there and Fiji. Ended our trip with a stay at the Hilton Fiji Beach Resort on Denarau Island in Nadi. You don't need a car here. We took a taxi from the port, airport is even closer. There are many hotels on Denarau Island to choose from. We like Hilton for it's location, lots of oceanfront with great pools and two restaurants right at water's edge. It's wonderful to sit on the deck at night listening to mellow island music. The hotel rooms are nice, but could use some up-dating. The outside of the buildings look more like college dorms with cinder block. But that's not real important.
The Bula Bus stops at each hotel every few minutes, cost very little for a day pass and takes you to the golf course or Port Denarau. Port Denarau is THE place to visit. It has great restaurants, live music, and they have a Fire Walker and Kava ceremony that is better than the ones we saw on cruise excursions and was free! I would suggest that if you want to participate in the Kava ceremony, do the one at the Hilton. I still can't believe I drank from the ONE cup that EVERYONE drank from, that had ash and dirt and who knows what at the port...but I'm still kicking, so whatever.
There is also a bus that takes you to downtown Nadi for very little money. We had spent three weeks on very small motus in the middle of pure natural beauty, so didn't feel the need to go see a third world town. I don't want that to sound harsh, but I would have been so disappointed if we'd stayed someplace other than Denarau Island.

GREAT FOOD RIGHT IN THE MARINA,"Everything we ordered was fantastic. Indian food isn't something we eat often so it was a real treat. Watch out for the ""coupon deal"". They give you one for a discount, tell you to keep it until the check comes, then after you get the check they say it's too late to use the coupon. Annoying, but man is the food good.",November 2015,Indigo Indian Asian Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g612490-d1588475-Reviews-Indigo_Indian_Asian_Restaurant-Denarau_Island_Viti_Levu.html,"Viti Levu, Fiji",restaurants,5.0,4.5
HISTORY AND A GREAT MEAL,"We'd passed by this restaurant for years and never really knew what it was about. Then while staying in LA we decided to go. Man oh Man had we been missing out. We've been to Morton's, Ruth's Chris, and many local ""great"" steak houses all over the country. This was the first time my steak was so tender it didn't even seem like meat. I had the filet mignon medallions and my husband had osso bucco, which is usually more tender than any steak...not this time! His wonderful dish didn't compare to mine, although it was ""fork cut tender"".
One misstep though...I ordered medium rare, I got well done. Thank goodness I decided I could not choke that down (it was so dry it was hard to swallow) so I sent it back. They were very apologetic and quickly brought me the correct steak, that has turned out to be the very best I've ever had.
Also, the restaurant itself is very interesting. It used to be a 1921 dining car. It has since been expanded and is fun to explore (martini in hand) and look at all the old pictures.",December 2015,Pacific Dining Car,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32655-d364719-Reviews-Pacific_Dining_Car-Los_Angeles_California.html,"Los Angeles, California",restaurants,5.0,4.0
Paper Thin Walls,"If you've come to party and stay up all night this could be your place. Walls in main building are paper thin. The noise from the party at the pool was so loud it woke us and sounded like it was in the room with us.

After finally getting back to sleep after 2:00 am were awakened again with noise from adjoining rooms. Earplugs a must to get some sleep here.

There's another building of the hotel's across the street. Odd but maybe quieter. Very pretty rooms.

Special place for Special Occassions,"This has been the families go to spot for celebrations since the 70's. The food is consistently great even if the prices are high. The staff makes each visit special whether it's your 1st or 50th visit. Someone HAS to order the crab legs. They're the best and with the size of the serving there's plenty to share. I would say that lately the beef has been a bit fatty, but some people like that.

JUST LIKE NEW ORLEANS FOOD,"I spent many months in New Orleans several years ago. Since then, every time a New Orleans style restaurant opens I get all excited and rush over to taste that fantastic food again. Unfortunately each time I was disappointed...until now. Ritter's Steam Kettle Cooking on Walnut in HB has come to my rescue! Every single dish from the gumbo to the fried okra was excellent and tasted just as it did in New Orleans. They even have bread pudding with bourbon sauce...better than the one I make! Actually, it's so good that my husband fried a turkey for Christmas and I got all the side dishes from Ritter's! Everyone thought I was brilliant!!

I don't get the steam kettle thing...but who cares when the food tastes this good. If you've been to New Orleans and want to relive the flavors, go to Ritter's. If you've never been, go to Ritter's and you'll find yourself wanting to book a flight.",December 2014,Ritter's Steam Kettle Cooking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32513-d15213620-Reviews-Ritter_s_Steam_Kettle_Cooking-Huntington_Beach_California.html,"Huntington Beach, California",restaurants,5.0,4.5
