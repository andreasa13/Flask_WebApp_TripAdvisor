Disappointing,"This is my sixth visit or so. All previous visits were tasty and fun.
This time ordered the special dish (beef marinated in silan -date honey)
Took forever to get the dish (we were not told it woll take longer than others), and there was nothing special except overly sweet fried onions on top. Meat was grainy and not soft. Bread was overly crusty. We were two people and left three quarters of the dish. No one asked why (even though we were sitting on the ""bar"". We had to *ask* for a second knife, and a *clean* fork.
No service at all.

Lovely hotel and waterfront,"great about the hotel: high quality and huge variety of food at the buffet breakfast and dinner. unlimited and large beach/spa towels. spacious waterfront. wonderful clear water/sea. the hotel gave complimentary in the room a mud bag, 2 water bottles, use of robes. lots of staff everywhere cleaning, assisting etc. several conference rooms. basic room had sea view.

problematic: smoking is allowed everywhere on the beach and by the pool. there should be a smoke-free zone, or a limited smoking area. and the lifeguard should definitely not smirk/laugh at me when i ask if there is a smoke-free area. finish sauna should have wooden floors that are slip-proof. (was terrible to watch a gentleman walk down the bench and slip on his back into the heater. Spa should be/have a cellphone / children free zone. ridiculous having grownups and kids having speakerphone conversations or watching movies while the intention of a spa is peace and quiet. bathroom doors should be vision and sound proof -glass sliding doors provide no privacy. each slightest sound is heard in the room and if someone sleeps it wakes them. room should be able to be dark. sun comes up very early, and the lights from outside shine in all night. i got no sleep. many of the staffers knew no English and/or Hebrew -so hard to communicate. no enough showers on the beach or clear water sauce. bathrooms on the beach close midday (and open late in the morning).

Also, two dishes ordered for two people and served over ten minutes apart so that the first dish (middle eastern calamari on a bed of tomato seads with hot peppers) cooled off and list some of it's charm by the time the foccacita with artichoke arrived.

Extremely disappointing,"Small portions, even for tapas. No connection between description in menu and actual dish. Bartenders with attitude though you cannot order at the bar without communicating with them, or understanding the menu.

Disappointing. After many years of enjoyment.,"Haven't been there in a year, and looks like there have been changes. Menu has been significantly downsized. Service was almost non existent. Got our coffees within minutes and the espresso was great. Waited for a Caprese salad for half an hour only to get an ice cold dish that had four ingredients recently pulled out of the fridge. While waiting for the food almost fainted asked for a bite of bread, they put in an order for a full load which arrived after the food. Companion ordered a traditional meat on bread dish. The bread was pizza like thin, on a metal platter that has seen better days. Nothing special about the taste. Each attempt at slicing was a challenge. No one came to check on us. No water till the half hour mark. Used to be my go to place.

Huge disappointment. Terrible service.,We ordered three dishes. The biggest starter for two -bruscata with meats and cheeses. Got billed for the bread separately. When we asked about it the shift manager made a spit noise on us. First took an hour to get food. No apologies. No discount. No freebees. No samples. Alcohol was tasteless and low %. The other two dishes were oven baked stews meat with mashed potatoes. One was ok. One great. Still lost appetite and returned most of the food. No one cared or asked what was wrong. We asked about food status several times. Was told there was an issue with the pizza oven. Never ordered pizza. Shameful. Pictured is the only thing served for the first hour. Bread arrived with the stater not as part of it.

Great value for money. Lovely 4+ star hotel,"Haven't been to other five star hotels in Belgrade so can't compare but this seems to cover most bases. Spa can be improved if semi size pool was heated, and jacuzi had more than four water spouts. Both should have non slip steps. Steam room ok and dry sauna was clean and spacious.

huge disappointment,"For starters: the street is so short, and nothing was going on outside except people trying to draw us in. The place is so noisy with two ""local"" bands playing in two adjunct rooms -you cant understand anything. We asked for the local meat pattie that looks like a hamburger with cheese inside -got a plate load of kababs. the chicken dish was disappointing too. we left more than half of each dish. no one came to see if we are happy.

The quality of the dishes, the variety, the taste, the service (SANDRA was AMAZING!!!!), the cleanliness (yes -bathrooms too!) the atmosphere -even the background music: all was just fabulous.

Worth the return visit,"I havent visited in about three months and was happy to see the restaurant refreshed the salad served as starters (free with a main course), got new dishes (lovely pottery), and some new items on the menu. the starters were refilled as many times as we wanted and the bread was a refreshing change (compared to the one they have been serving past couple of years). My friend took the beef filet which is always a winner. i tried the ""platter"" of 3 pieces of filet fish, and frankly was slightly disappointed with the portion size, the amount of oil (was supposed to be grilled, but has too much oil) and the fact that one piece was full of bones. but it was lovely. we were not pushed to leave even 2 hours after eating, and the atmosphere was great. i recommend asking for a table by the window on top floor to avoid the fish smell of the lower floor when the place full. and make a reservation in advance.",January 2019,Dolphin Yam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293983-d809697-Reviews-Dolphin_Yam-Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html,"Jerusalem, Israel",restaurants,5.0,4.5
Ok basic,"It's the only establishment in the area that serves food with tables and waiters so it does get a slow and calm amount of visitors. The lunch special includes a soup (choice of 3) and most main courses. Minestrone was a bit watery and had no been, pasta, etc. Small but sufficient portion. For the main course I took the eggplant parmesan and it was 2 thin layers of slightly bitter eggplant with cheese over under and around. I was warned plate hot, which quite was but did not have to wait for dish to cool. Sauce was on the sweet side. Food was served in perfect timing but it has been over 15 minutes since my last bite and no one cleared table / offered espresso/dessert or asked if I wanted anything or the check. I'm not even sure the business lunch includes anything else. Asked for water and graded parmesan for soup separately (had to go in to find a waiter to ask). I guess ok for a neighborhood place.

I ordered a loveley dish but it included half liter of oil. I asked and got a second plate and spent a while transferring all items to clean plate. Octopus was perfect.
