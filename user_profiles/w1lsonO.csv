Very nice views,"It was interesting to visit this place not only because of ancient ruins, but also nice views to the Athens - all from above. I think that the better time to visit is in the morning or in the evening, especially when it is hot.",August 2019,Acropolis,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d198706-Reviews-Acropolis-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,5.0,4.5
"Nothing special, but it depends on travellers expectations","It was very hot. Poor soldiers - they have to stand in a still pose. We were just passing by while going to another museum, so no problem, but I would not go there with the intention to see how soldiers stand there.",August 2019,Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g189400-d245993-Reviews-Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier-Athens_Attica.html,"Athens, Greece",attractions,2.0,4.5
